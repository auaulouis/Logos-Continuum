#### The United States should establish a regional East Asian cooperative maritime security partnership modeled on the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative to establish a cooperative framework that includes, but is not limited to, disaster relief, information-sharing, crisis consultation, joint exercises and operations, environmental protection, measures to avoid incidents, measures to maintain sea-borne trade, resource management, anti-piracy, and anti-trafficking efforts. The United States should invite all East Asian countries to join the partnership and should immediately begin cooperative efforts with any countries that agree.

#### Cooperation solves

**Gompert 13** (David C. Gompert, professor of national security studies

https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR151.html)

Given technological trends, an unfavorable time-line, and the fact that
the United States cannot retreat from the waters of this vital region,
it should also pursue a political alternative to head-to-head sea-power
rivalry---one that engages its regional partners and, ideally, China
itself. With the rapid expansion of sea-borne commerce and sea-based
resource extraction that has accompanied globalization, [the idea of
collective maritime security]{.underline}, first championed by Admiral
Mike Mullen (in 2005, when he was Chief of Naval Operations[), has
gained momentum in a number of regions other than East
Asia]{.underline}. If the targeting and networking revolutions
invalidate Mahan's prescription for concentrated naval power, [U.S.
leadership in organizing cooperative maritime security in East Asia may
invalidate his premise that sea power is necessarily
adversarial]{.underline}. Even as the dominant sea power, the United
States cannot provide sea control in every ocean, littoral, and
choke-point where it is needed in today's world. Just as the United
States is capitalizing on its strength at sea to [mobilize and lead
others toward cooperative maritime security elsewhere, it should try to
do so in the Western Pacific, where the stakes are
greatest]{.underline}.

More specifically, the United States should propose and pursue an East
Asian maritime partnership, inviting to join all states that share its
interest in assured access and passage. Such [cooperation could be
predicated on the norms that disputes should be settled nonviolently and
that civilian shipping engaged in peaceful, peacetime trade should not
be threatened]{.underline}. These norms could be buttressed by [enhanced
maritime information-sharing, crisis consultations, joint exercises and
operations (e.g., against non-state threats)]{.underline}, and measures
to [avoid incidents]{.underline}. Realistically, resolving the region's
complex maritime legal disputes should not be a precondition for
creating or joining the partnership; but a pledge to refrain from force
in the meantime should be. Neither the United States nor China would be
expected to reduce its sea-power capabilities or relinquish any of its
options in the event of war. [While such undertakings would not preclude
naval/anti-naval competition or conflict outright, they could reduce
mistrust and mistakes of the sort that are more likely than rational
forethought to trigger Sino-U.S. hostilities.]{.underline}

#### US military backing means everyone will say yes

**Gompert '13** (David C. Gompert, professor of national security
studies at the U.S. Naval Academy and an adjunct fellow at the RAND

Although naval/anti-naval technology trends are unfavorable to U.S. sea
power in East Asia, the improved capabilities of key states that look to
the United States for leadership can be a major geo-strategic asset
vis-à-vis China's growing power. This assumes, of course, that the
United States retains their trust by maintaining its power and backing
its friends in the region when China attempts to coerce them. It also
assumes that the American statesmen and military leaders will be
skillful enough to strengthen and expand U.S. security relationships in
a way that incentivizes Chinese moderation rather than Chinese
hostility. At the same time, the United States cannot fail to support
and receive support from its allies and partners out of fear that China
will disapprove.

Although there is a regional preference for U.S. power and tentative
multilateral cooperation, the United States has no Western Pacific
alliance like NATO---and no prospect for one---on which to organize a
maritime alliance. China exhibits neither the revolutionary zealotry nor
the expansionist drive that the Soviet Union had (in its prime) and that
made NATO a requirement in Europe. Moreover, while the Soviet Union was
economically and politically completely isolated from Western Europe,
China is an inseparable part of East Asia---economically, culturally,
and demographically. Barring a burst of Chinese aggressiveness, a
U.S.-led NATO-like structure for East Asia is neither advisable nor
feasible. Nevertheless, with [growing regional naval capabilities and
concern about China, it might be possible for the United States to
institutionalize multilateral maritime security---an East Asian maritime
partnership---involving the countries mentioned above and most
others.]{.underline}

Generally, the United States has found that its Global Maritime
Partnership Initiative has branched into regional endeavors. This comes
as no surprise, [given that most nations' maritime interests are more
local or regional than global]{.underline}. Because, again, East Asia is
a virtual archipelago---[with some of the world's most important and
interdependent economies spanning some of the world's most important
seas]{.underline}---it could be argued that no region has a [greater
need for a multilateral approach to maritime security]{.underline}.
Moreover, because the region's main seafaring nations are prosperous and
have competent navies, it is only reasonable that they should do their
fair share in collectively securing waters that are at least as
important to them as to the United States.

Of course, the idea of creating an East Asia maritime security
partnership raises the question of its relation to China. The argument
for excluding China is that its own naval and anti-naval capabilities
and activities are the principal threats that would prompt its neighbors
to join the United States in multilateral maritime security. By this
reasoning, such a maritime security grouping would be a naval alliance
against China. However, aligning the region against China could result
in economic protectionism, accelerated Chinese anti-access efforts,
increased risk of conflict, and diminished maritime security. Moreover,
while China's neighbors are anxious about China's capabilities and
conduct, especially at sea, it is doubtful that they would want to
organize against it, with or without the United States.

The argument for including China is twofold. [First, it]{.underline}
[would allay Chinese suspicion that the true goals of the United States
in the region are China's encirclement and containment]{.underline}.
Second, [with China being such an important trading partner of all the
prospective participants in such a regional grouping, its exclusion from
an attempt to secure regional trade would be anomalous and
unproductive]{.underline}. Unlike the Soviet Union's isolation to
Europe, [China is an integral part of the region and its economy.
Security of regional sea-borne trade and security of sea-borne trade
with China are completely entangled]{.underline}.

Under the right conditions, [including China in a multilateral East
Asian maritime partnership could have a salutary effect on security at
sea, on regional security in general, and on U.S. interests. Better to
bring inside than leave outside the rising power with capacities to
either improve or degrade maritime security. More generally, better to
increase China's stake in regional arrangements than to cement its
isolation and cause it to become revisionist]{.underline}.

Assuming that China would be invited to join it, the question then
arises as to what threat, if not China, would motivate the formation of
the grouping. As already noted, the Mullen idea addressed both non-state
threats to maritime security and dangerous or harmful sea trafficking by
states and non-states. Apart from such external threats, an East Asian
maritime partnership including China would constitute a sort of
collective security arrangement---one with a circumscribed purpose and
scope: to provide maritime security. Generally speaking, collective
security is different in kind than a security alliance in that it
includes all states in a given geographic domain, whether friendly or
not. It is undergirded by an understanding that all participating states
will refrain from force and other aggressive conduct. [Further, it is
disciplined by a corresponding understanding---at least an
implication--- that the participants will organize and may act against
any state that violates the collective security, even if that state had
acceded to the grouping. In effect, a collective security arrangement
can be transformed into an alliance against any wayward
participant.]{.underline}14

Jeffrey Lewis, an East Asia expert at the Monterey Institute of

China's defense spending goes to forces in the vicinity of
Taiwan]{.underline} --- at a cost of \$30 billion to \$50 billion a
year. A deal for the resolution of Taiwan's status could save China
\$500 billion in defense spending by 2020 and allow Beijing to break
even by 2030, while reducing America's debt and serving our broader
economic interests.

The Chinese leadership would be startled --- for a change --- if the
United States were to adopt such a savvy negotiating posture. Beyond
reducing our debt, [a Taiwan deal could pressure Beijing to end its

Relying on new insights [from game theory]{.underline}, scholars during
the 1980s and 1990s emphasized that [so-called international
regimes,]{.underline} [consisting of agreed-on international norms,
rules, and decision-making procedures, can help states effectively
coordinate their policies and collaborate in the production of
international public goods, such as free trade, arms control, and
environmental protection.]{.underline} Especially, if embedded in formal
multilateral institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) or
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFT A), regimes crucially improve
the availability of information among states in a given issue area,
thereby promoting reciprocity and enhancing the reputational costs of
noncompliance. As noted by Robert Keohane, [institutionalized
multilateralism also reduces strategic competition over relative gains
and thus further advances international cooperation]{.underline}. Most
international regime theorists accepted Kenneth Waltz\'s (1979)
neorealist assumption of states as black boxes-that is, unitary and
rational actors with given interests. Little or no attention was paid to
the impact on international cooperation of domestic political processes
and dynamics. Likewise, regime scholarship largely disregarded the
arguably crucial question of whether prolonged interaction in an
institutionalized international setting can fundamentally change
states\' interests or preferences over outcomes (as opposed to
preferences over strategies), thus engendering positive feedback loops
of increased overall cooperation. For these reasons, international
regime theory is not, properly speaking, liberal, and the term
neoliberal institutionalism frequently used to identify it is somewhat
misleading. It is only over the past decade or so that liberal
international relations theorists have begun to systematically study the
relationship between domestic politics and institutionalized
international cooperation or global governance. This new scholarship
seeks to explain in particular the close international cooperation among
liberal democracies as well as higher-than-average levels of delegation
b)\' democracies to complex multilateral bodies, such as the European
Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), NAFTA, and the
WTO (see, e.g., John Ikenberry, 2001; Helen Milner & Andrew Moravcsik,
2009). [The reasons that make liberal democracies particularly
enthusiastic about international cooperation are manifold]{.underline}:
First, transnational actors such as [nongovernmental organizations and
private corporations thrive in liberal democracies, and they frequently
advocate increased international cooperation]{.underline}; second,
elected democratic [officials rely on delegation to multilateral bodies
such as the WTO or the EU to commit to a stable policy line and to
internationally lock in fragile domestic policies and constitutional
arrangements; and finally, powerful liberal democracies, such as the
United States and its allies, voluntarily bind themselves into complex
global governance arrangements to demonstrate strategic restraint and
create incentives for other states to cooperate, thereby reducing the
costs for maintaining international order.]{.underline} Recent
scholarship, such as that of Charles Boehmer and colleagues, has also
confirmed the classical liberal intuition that formal international
institutions, such as the United Nations (UN) or NATO, independently
contribute to peace, especially when they are endowed with sophisticated
administrative structures and [information-gathering capacities. In
short, research on global governance and especially on the relationship
between democracy and international cooperation is thriving, and it
usefully complements liberal scholarship on the democratic
peace.]{.underline}

AMERICA'S TWO-PRONGED STRATEGY [How, then, should America respond to
China's military modernization?]{.underline} [First, we must continue to
invest in transformational US military capabilities in a portfolio
approach that gives appropriate emphasis to highly advanced aerospace
and maritime forces as well as the ground and special forces needed for
other near-term missions. We also must continue to improve intelligence
collection and analysis regarding the Chinese military. Beyond this,
Washington must maintain and expand US alliances in Asia, preserving
alliances with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and pursuing deeper
military partnerships with the Philippines, Singapore, India, and
possibly Vietnam.]{.underline} Strengthening the US-ROK alliance and
maintaining the American presence in Guam are particularly important for
deterring North Korea, reassuring Japan, and demonstrating commitment to
the region. [The United States must also continue to ensure that its
military has the capability to defend Taiwan from an unprovoked Chinese
invasion or other kind of military coercion]{.underline}. At the same
time, we must continue to conduct military-to-military activities with
China, such as the planned talks between the US Commander of Strategic
Command and the head of the Chinese Second Artillery[. An important
instrument of both engagement and hedging, military-to-military contact
creates mutual familiarity that can help avoid miscalculations in
moments of crisis, tension, or competition. For example, discussion of
crisis management strategies]{.underline} might help to avoid
misunderstandings such as the 1999 Belgrade Embassy bombing and the 2001
Hainan mid-air collision. Rather than insist on absolute reciprocity in
military-to-military activities, [we should instead work to achieve
"value-based reciprocity," where each side obtains equal
benefits]{.underline}. Finally, we should expand military-to-military
activities to anticipate [joint action that might benefit both
countries. Joint action could include search-and-rescue,
counter-terrorism, counter-piracy, counter-narcotics, counter-people
smuggling, humanitarian relief, noncombatant evacuation, and
peacekeeping]{.underline}. POTENTIAL PITFALLS In managing our
relationship with China, what steps should the United States avoid?
First, we should not attempt to create a regional anti-Chinese alliance.
Most of the potential members of such an alliance need to protect and
nurture their bilateral relationships with China and would thus refuse
to join a "hedge-only" US strategy. Second, we must resist the
temptation to create a formal defensive alliance with Taiwan or offer an
unconditional guarantee of American military assistance. Washington
should also unequivocally oppose any effort by Taiwan to obtain an
independent offensive deterrent, especially in the form of nuclear
weapons. Third, an attempt to neutralize China's nuclear deterrent with
counterforce or missile defense would not only fail to achieve
comprehensive or assured protection from a Chinese nuclear strike, but
would likely prompt China to build a larger nuclear force than it
otherwise would. Finally, the United States must not deny China access
to resources (such as oil) that it needs for its economic development.
Of course, Washington should also encourage Beijing to follow the same
policy. China's reforms may aim eventually to match the United States in
comprehensive military power---but China's leaders no doubt recognize
that this parity will take decades, at the least, to achieve (2). In the
meantime, Washington must respond to China's military modernization in a
way that avoids stumbling into a new cold war, at the same time making
that prospect unattractive to China's future leaders.

everyone else on the planet, but the US can only work with a short list
as approved by the Appropriations Committee, it should be expected that
the Chinese, drawing on the knowledge base of the entire world, will
advance more quickly. We have no lead in ISRU, and our lead in other
domains of space technology may not be particularly relevant to this

Charles L. **Glaser 15** - Charles L. Glaser is professor of political

Institute for Security and Conflict Studies. His research focuses on
international relations theory and international security policy. "A
U.S.-China Grand Bargain? The Hard Choice between Military Competition
and Accommodation" International Security, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Spring 2015),
pp. 49-90.
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/isec_a_00199.pdf>. NL

The preceding assessment lays bare the complexity of a U.S. policy of
territorial accommodation. On the one hand, ending the U.S. commitment
to Taiwan could greatly reduce and might even eliminate the possibility
of a large war between the United States and China by keeping the United
States out of a China-Taiwan conºict. In addition, accommodation could
improve China's understanding of U.S. goals and its image of the United
States, and moderate military competition in Northeast Asia, thereby
setting U.S.-China relations on a promising trajectory that takes
advantage of the relatively benign structural environment in which
China's rise will occur. On the other hand, [accommodation would be
costly---running contrary to U.S. political and ideological
interests---and risky, possibly reducing U.S. security by fueling
Chinese underestimates of U.S. resolve and by encouraging China to adopt
more extensive geopolitical aims]{.underline}. The United States' choice
of whether to end its commitment to defend Taiwan is complicated further
by uncertainty about the nature and extent of China's goals. If China
places relatively little value on expanding its control and inºuence
beyond Taiwan, then even if U.S. accommodation generated doubts about
U.S. resolve, they would be of little consequence. In contrast, [if
China highly values winning all of its maritime disputes and pushing the
United States out of Northeast Asia, then reductions in U.S. credibility
would be more costly.]{.underline} Similarly, if China's aims are both
limited and stable, then U.S. accommodation would not risk creating a
more dangerous China. In contrast, if China's goals are still evolving
and [if U.S. accommodation would empower domestic hard-liners, then U.S.
security would be reduced]{.underline}. Therefore, the question arises
whether policies exist that would reduce the risks while preserving the
beneªts of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan. [If combining certain
concessions by China in an overall package---a grand bargain, for lack
of a better term---could achieve this goal, then the United States' best
option might be to make ending its commitment to Taiwan contingent on
China making concessions of its own]{.underline}. The preceding analysis
suggests that the United States should design such a grand bargain with
a variety of purposes in mind: to gain information about the nature and
extent of China's motives; to demonstrate its resolve to retain U.S.
security commitments in the region; and, related, to preserve the
credibility of its commitments to its allies. Likely the most common way
to envision a grand bargain is as an agreement in which two actors make
concessions across multiple issue to create a fair deal---that is, one
in which both beneªt equally---that would have been impossible in an
agreement that dealt with a single issue. A different way to envision a
grand bargain is as an agreement in which the states trade across
multiple issues, making both states better off, but not necessarily
equally. A grand bargain in Northeast Asia is likely to take the latter
form, partly because the agreement would be in response to a power shift
that favors China and partly because China's interests in the region are
greater than those of the United States. [The first component of a grand
bargain, and probably the most important, would be for China to resolve
its maritime disputes on "fair" terms]{.underline}.100 Oddly, there
seems to be both a little and a lot at stake in these disputes. Gaining
sovereignty over the offshore islands would strengthen China's claims to
the oil and gas reserves, which have increased the importance of the
disputes. At the same time, however, [the disputes have severely
hindered the exploration and extraction of]{.underline} these
[resources, and joint extraction and sharing agreements could provide
all parties with substantial resource benefits]{.underline}. Growing
nationalism has given the disputed territorial claims importance far
beyond their material and strategic value, and it has damaged the
prospects for any type of agreement. A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? 79 100.
[The United States is not directly involved in these disputes, but it
could encourage or pressure its allies to make compromises. An ideal
solution would be for China and its neighbors to place the territories
under some sort of international control as a maritime preserve and to
share the resources.101 Other solutions include joint governance over
the use of the islands/islets, agreement not to object to other states'
sovereignty claims, and agreement to end unilateral military patrols
near the disputed territories]{.underline}.102 [China's willingness to
reach an agreement on the offshore islands and related maritime disputes
would provide the United States with valuable information. Most
obviously, it would demonstrate that China's aims are
limited]{.underline} (at least for now). Closely related, [it would
demonstrate a degree of reasonableness in Chinese foreign policy
priorities]{.underline} and decisionmaking: given that the value of
Taiwan dwarfs the value of these maritime disputes, Chinese
unwillingness to reach this type of bargain would indicate deep
inºexibility in its emerging foreign policy and possibly overconªdence
in its ability to use its growing power to achieve all of its aims.
China's claims in these disputes are also weaker than its claims to
Taiwan: for example, China did not claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands
until 1970, which suggests that it should be able to moderate this claim
if the beneªts were sufªciently large. In addition, an agreement would
provide the United States with insights into the balance of power within
China's foreign policy decisionmaking. If China's more assertive
policies have reºected the growing inºuence of the People's Liberation
Army, narrow nationalist pressures, or both, then Chinese concessions
would demonstrate that the country's leaders could control these forces
when the stakes are sufªciently large. [Taken as a whole, this
information about China's goals would make U.S. accommodation over
Taiwan less risky. Insisting on Chinese concessions would also
demonstrate U.S. resolve to protect American interests. By making its
willingness to end its commitment to Taiwan contingent on Chinese
concessions, the United States would make clear that it is willing to
run the risk of protecting Taiwan and its allies' interests in the South
China and East China Seas, if China were uncompromising]{.underline}.
Once again, the key issue from the U.S. perspective comes back to
information---if China is more likely to have unlimited aims, then the
risks of U.S. accommodation are larger and the United States should
therefore be less willing to adopt this strategy. As argued above,
China's refusal to accept a grand bargain, especially one that is so
clearly weighted toward its interests (unless China is determined to
push the United States out of Northeast Asia), would indicate more
ambitious Chinese aims. Thus, [compared to unilateral concessions,
insisting on a package deal that included Chinese concessions would
demonstrate a higher level of U.S. resolve. In addition, resolution of
the maritime disputes would directly increase U.S. security by
eliminating disputes that, via alliance commitments, could draw the
United States into dangerous crises with China]{.underline}. [A second
component of a grand bargain would be official Chinese acceptance of the
United States' long-term security role in East Asia, including its
alliances and forward-deployed forces]{.underline}. There have been
periods when China viewed the U.S.-Japan alliance relatively favorable.
For example, in 1980 China's leader, Hua Guofeng, stated: "We appreciate
Japan's efforts to strengthen its alliance with the United States."103
Since then a variety of factors, including the decline of Soviet power
and the redeªnition of the U.S.-Japan alliance starting in the mid-1990s
have reduced, if not eliminated, China's positive assessment.104 In
recent years, some Chinese elites have begun expressing harshly negative
views. For example, in 2014 the deputy chief of the general staff of the
People's Liberation Army described the U.S. alliance system as "an
antiquated relic of the Cold War that should be replaced by an
Asia-centric security architecture."105 Although open to varying
interpretations, President Xi Jinping's call for an Asian security order
managed by Asian countries and his criticism of "alliances as unhelpful
for the region's security" can be viewed as offering a vision of the
future in which the United States no longer plays a security role in
East Asia. Increasingly, there is support in China for the conclusion
that "in Beijing's eyes, the U.S. led security architecture is outliving
the usefulness it once provided by ensuring the regional stability
necessary for China's development. Instead, China views the alliance
system as increasingly incapable of providing lasting security and
itself a potential source of threat."106 Especially in light of

acceptance of the United States' continuing alliance commitments would
be a valuable signal (not cheap talk). It would indicate the dominance
of certain domestic forces over others and the Chinese leadership's
willingness to accept domestic political costs to advance China's
foreign policy. Such action would not guarantee stability in China's
policy, but it would provide greater conªdence that China was willing to
accept a revised geopolitical status quo. Maybe more important, if China
were unwilling (or unable) to provide this ofªcial acceptance, the
United States would have to be more worried that China's leaders believe
that its role in East Asia requires pushing the United States out of the

pursue a mix of cooperative and competitive policies.107 [Maintaining

Confrontation,

Robert Kaplan, one of the world's foremost experts on China, has stated
"**[The South China Sea will be the 21st Century's defining
battleground]{.underline}**." The obsession with supremacy in the South
China Sea is certainly not a new phenomenon in the realms of
international security and maritime strategy. In opinionated discussions
related to naval warfare, prominent political scientists and military
strategists have been addressing the geopolitical and military
significance of the region for decades. For example, the enlightening
1997 article "The Chinese Way", written in the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists by Professor Chalmers Johnson of the University of
California-San Diego, noted significantly increased defense budgets and
expenditures in the region. In addition, the article eludes to the fact
that China had claimed the entire South China Sea and would use its
naval forces to counter any encroachment. [The argument for an increased
U.S. naval presence in East Asia is certainly not without precedent.
This contested aquatic region has tremendous geopolitical, strategic and
economic significance]{.underline}. While, the Persian Gulf has immense
importance and global recognition due to its strategic location in the
Middle East, as well its significance to global commerce, industry and
sought after oil, [the South China Sea is crucially important to nations
seeking to obtain their economic riches and geopolitical
advantages]{.underline}. The South China Sea is geographically located
near the Pacific Ocean and encompasses an area of 1.4 million square
miles (3.5 million square kilometers). As a semi-closed area, the South
China Sea extends from the Singapore Strait to the Taiwan Strait, with
China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan
surrounding it. [In terms of economic value, fishery stocks and
potential fossil fuel reserves are two major commodities that may spark
an armed conflict, even to the point of **nuclear
confrontation**.]{.underline} As a rich source of the region's staple
diet, fish, the sea guarantees a steady flow of food to the countries of
the region. Control and supremacy of the sea would also assure claiming
the much touted hydrocarbon reserves in the seabed, possibly exceeding
those of the OPEC nations such as Iraq and Kuwait. The conquest of this
vast resource would virtually assure energy independence and high
monetary returns for those that would gain supremacy over the South
China Sea. Thus, seizing the opportunity to gain dominance will lead to
control and manipulation of vital food and energy resources, economic
wealth and geopolitical power in the region. [A scenario of regional and
maritime domination and control could lead to the partial or total
exclusion of adjacent nation-states to access any food or natural
resources]{.underline} derived from a sea ruled with an iron hand;
[leading to a massive complex humanitarian catastrophe of immense
proportions from malnutrition and starvation, limitations in **energy
production**, and **economic collapse**.]{.underline} These factors make
the South China Sea a national security priority for nations in the
region, including one of the world's superpowers, China. The dependence
of China and other regional nations surrounding the South China Sea on
the Strait of Malacca is analogous in geopolitical and economic terms,
to the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Approximately one -third of
all global trade funnels through the strait and also serves as a conduit
for raw materials and energy needs for China and other adjacent
nation-states. [Such potential dominance in any region, leads to a
high-stakes game of brinkmanship, and at least the possibility of a
regional war which could conceivably escalate to engulf nation-states
external to the regional sphere. Tensions and skirmishes have the
propensity to evolve into armed conflict and **full-scale
war**]{.underline}, and apprehensive leaders and military planners in
such a contested region serve as the facilitators for disaster. China
continues to assert sovereignty by constructing man made islands using
sand dredged from the sea bottom and these artificial islands could be
militarized. China has even affirmed its desire to have a military
presence on these islands; however, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang
Yi, also professes the use of these land masses to facilitate commerce
via shipping lanes and to protect Chinese fishing and other vessels from
piracy. China will never cease its quest for supremacy and its perceived
"ownership" of the South China Sea, as the legitimacy and structure of
the Chinese government is based on nationalism and achievement of the
"Chinese Dream". The Chinese regime continues to vehemently assert their
perceived "right" to the South China Sea, and it forges ahead with plans
and operations that could lead to naval warfare and conflict escalation.
The knowledge that China possesses formidable naval capacity and
capabilities, including nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines,
is, indeed, disconcerting at the very least. As we examine and evaluate
the "submarine factor", it is evident that China's submarines have no
practical value in its disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines.
Essentially, nuclear ballistic missile capable submarines serve as a
deterrent against thermonuclear war. Without doubt, the primary reason
that China possesses nuclear-capable submarines is to deter an American
attack, although India's nuclear weapons are also a consideration for
Beijing. Nuclear capable submarines are capable of deep dive
capabilities and shorter launch to target times. While China's submarine
capabilities may appear worrisome to some, sudden deployment from port
in a geopolitical crisis would serve as a critical indicator to the US
and Western allies, and its submarine fleet still remains somewhat noisy
and detectable. China has already demonstrated its aggression at sea in
several instances, such as the ramming and sinking of a Vietnamese
fishing boat in disputed waters claimed by both countries in the region
and an ominous presence and military mobilization exercises which have
been monitored by military and intelligence assets. A report by the
National Air and Space Intelligence Center, indicates that Chinese SSBNs
are able to target portions of the U.S. from strategic operational
positions near the Chinese coast. China's Global Times published an
unprecedented report that revealed a nuclear missile strike on the
western U.S. with JL-2 missiles could generate up to 12 million American
fatalities. The Obama administration and senior U.S. naval officials
have not retorted to China's claims of a potentially devastating nuclear
threat, which included graphics showing radiological plumes and
collateral damage induced by radiation. The possibilities of China's
anti-satellite strategies to disable communications and
intelligence-gathering capabilities must also be taken seriously. Most
assuredly, **[the South China Sea would serve as an obvious arena for
the projection of Chinese power, including]{.underline}** conventional
and, potentially, **[nuclear scenarios.]{.underline}**

(Donald, *The China Fallacy*, p.161-162)

[If China were to permanently eliminate the missiles facing
Taiwan]{.underline}, [while significantly and verifiably reducing and
redeploying the air and naval forces currently threatening the
island]{.underline}, [Taiwan\'s security would be markedly
improved]{.underline}. [This outcome can be achieved through **mutual
threat reduction measures** that **reduce**]{.underline}, eliminate and
redeploy [advanced weapons and military equipment that]{.underline}
either [Taiwan or China could employ in the event of
conflict]{.underline}. [Such measures would make it far more difficult
for either side to threaten or intimidate the other for political
purposes]{.underline}, [in addition to significantly lowering their
capacity to wreak destruction during an actual war]{.underline}.

[Because Taiwan is]{.underline} now [militarily inferior to China with
regard to missiles]{.underline}, [naval vessels and air force
assets]{.underline}, [it **lacks the diplomatic leverage** to eliminate
the security threat that China poses]{.underline}. Short of agreeing to
reunification---which is currently opposed by a majority of Taiwan\'s
citizens---[there are no measures Taiwan can offer as **a sufficient
quid pro quo to secure significant Chinese arms
reductions**]{.underline}. And, [without reciprocal security
measures]{.underline}, [China **refuses to engage in**]{.underline} what
it considers **["unilateral disarmament."]{.underline}**

By contrast, [the U.S. is **capable of securing a drastic reduction in
China\'s military threat to Taiwan** by offering **reciprocal military
measures** that would lead to **far greater stability in the
region**]{.underline}, [creating a transformed regional security
environment]{.underline}. [China is highly likely to
reduce]{.underline}, redeploy and eliminate [its missile]{.underline},
[naval and air forces now threatening the island]{.underline}, **[in
exchange for the U.S. pulling back forces]{.underline}** now engaged in
surveillance and patrolling of Chinese territory, **[significantly
reducing U.S. military deployments in the Asia Pacific]{.underline}**,
and scaling down major arms sales to Taiwan.

It is also important to recall that Taiwan\'s prior negotiations with
China on long-term political issues reflect the profound difficulty the
two sides face in reaching an agreement that could truly stabilize their
relations for the foreseeable future. Taiwan understandably fears being
absorbed by China, knowing full well that Beijing\'s foremost objective
is national reunification at the earliest possible time. A large
majority of Taiwan\'s people reject Beijing\'s promise to guarantee the
island\'s autonomy and democratic political system through a so-called
"one country, two systems" formula. For its part, China worries that
Taiwan\'s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), though currently out of
power, could strongly re-emerge in the future, and once again lead a
drive for political independence which effectively thwarts national
reunification.

[A Framework Agreement would strengthen the security of
Taiwan]{.underline} and the preservation of its democratic political
system [without requiring it to agree to eventual reunification with
China]{.underline}. [It would be entirely up to the Taiwanese government
and people whether to conduct bilateral negotiations on political
reunification at some future time]{.underline}. [The two sides would be
able to carry out their negotiations in a largely **non-threatening and
stable security environment**]{.underline}, [which would help
support]{.underline}, [in and of itself]{.underline}, **[a successful
agreement on difficult political issues]{.underline}**.

[Eliminating the Risk of a U.S.-China military conflict]{.underline}

[The proposed]{.underline} security measures in a [Framework Agreement
would end the current military standoff over Taiwan as well as the
broader friction arising from aggressive U.S. air and sea surveillance
along China\'s coast]{.underline}. [Whenever China-Taiwan relations
become acrimonious]{.underline}---as they typically do when the
Taiwanese political party favoring independence is in power or when
Chinese leaders play to nationalist public opinion and threaten a future
attack on the island---[it greatly heightens the security risks that the
U.S. faces in Asia]{.underline}. [In the event of an imminent or actual
attack on Taiwan]{.underline}, [the U.S. would almost certainly send
military forces to the island\'s aid]{.underline}, with proponents of
intervention [citing U.S. obligations under the Taiwan Relations
Act]{.underline}. National security strategists would argue that a
military response is essential to ensure the credibility of the overall
U.S. security posture in Asia, particularly the defense commitments to
Japan and South Korea.

[The current standoff over Taiwan effectively puts the U.S. at the mercy
of political elements in China and Taiwan that seek to achieve their
goals without regard for U.S. interests]{.underline}. [Those interests
include both protecting Taiwan and avoiding a war with China that could
conceivably **escalate to a nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. [By
realizing a Framework Agreement with China that protects Taiwan\'s
democracy]{.underline}, [stabilizes the region and **eliminates the risk
of a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan**]{.underline}, [the U.S. would
greatly advance its core policy objectives]{.underline}.

If accommodation on Taiwan would increase U.S. security even without
reciprocal Chinese concessions, then it is necessary to consider whether
the greater beneªts that would be provided by a grand bargain warrant
the risks of forgoing the beneªts of unilateral accommodation
altogether. In other words, if a grand bargain is likely infeasible,
should the United States unilaterally end its commitment to Taiwan? It
is necessary to consider this possibility because the long-standing
disputes in the South China and East China Seas might continue to defy
resolution. Possibly most signiªcant, the recent escalation of tensions
between China and Japan, and the hardening of their positions, suggests
that the prospects for resolution of the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute are
decreasing. [Although the probability of achieving a grand bargain may
be low, **[the United States should not]{.mark}** now **[unilaterally
end its commitment to defend Taiwan. China appears too likely to
misinterpret such a large change]{.mark}** in U.S. policy, which could
**[fuel Chinese overconªdence]{.mark}** and **[intensify challenges to
U.S. interests]{.mark}**---most importantly, the U.S. security role in
Northeast Asia. In large part, this judgment is [informed by China's
more assertive regional policies]{.mark} and pronouncements over the
past decade]{.underline}. I do believe, though, that this is a close
call. Prior to 2008 or so, unilateral accommodation might have been the
United States' best option. Thus, a sustained moderation in China's
policies could support a different decision in the future. Finally, U.S.
pursuit of a grand bargain would not prevent the United States from
eventually moving to unilateral accommodation---[if during U.S. pursuit
of a grand bargain China made clear that agreement was impossible,
unilateral accommodation would remain a fallback option. U.S. unilateral
adoption of less dramatic changes in the government's Taiwan
policy---most importantly, slowing or ending U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan110---is an option that might provide a better balance of risks
and beneªt. Even this much smaller change in U.S. policy, however, risks
sending China the wrong signal]{.underline}. Another way to balance
feasibility and beneªts, therefore, could be to look for a path that
divides the grand bargain into smaller, more attainable increments. One
can imagine [a series of steps, including the United States ending its
arms sales to Taiwan and China ending its use of force]{.underline} to
advance its maritime claims, [that could be implemented sequentially to
create a phased grand bargain. This approach would enable the United
States to revert to its current Taiwan policy if China failed to uphold
its side of the phased agreement]{.underline}. Another possibility might
include partial resolution of the maritime disputes. An agreement that
delayed resolution of the sovereignty disputes far into the future, or
indeªnitely, while settling the resource disputes would be more feasible
to achieve than a full resolution. This type of agreement could be
possible because, for the most part, the sovereignty disputes can be
separated from the resource disputes. In fact, China and Japan reached
this type of arrangement in 2008, although it has yet to be
implemented.111 The United States could pursue a variant of this staged
approach that would enable it to try to push the diplomatic process
forward.

#### CP solves the case, Taiwan, and our disads -- BUT the plan and perm link

**Glaser**, professor of political science at George Washington

(Charles L., \"A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?\" *International Security*
Volume 39, Number 4, Project Muse)

U.S. accommodation of China deserves serious analysis for two reasons.
First, both intuition and international relations theory suggest that a
rising power, especially one that has experienced tremendous growth, can
reasonably expect to increase its geopolitical influence and more fully
achieve its goals, especially when these goals involve its national
security. [Bargaining theories maintain that the probability of war is
greater when there is a larger disparity between the distribution of
benefits in the existing territorial status quo and the balance of
power]{.underline}.3 Accommodation that reduces this disparity can,
under some conditions, reduce the probability of war and increase the
declining state's security.

Second, the pressures created by the international structure---the
combination of material and information conditions that constrain
states' international options---should allow China to rise peacefully,
which, somewhat counterintuitively, increases the potential importance
of accommodation. If the international structure were driving the United
States and China toward a major conflict, the concessions required of
the United States would be extremely large and costly. Even then, they
might do little to moderate the intense competition. But, because the
international structure is not creating such intense pressures,
[concessions that do not compromise vital U.S. interests may have the
potential to greatly diminish growing strains in U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}, thereby [moderating future military and foreign
policy competition between the two powers]{.underline}.

More concretely, regional dangers dwarf international structural
dangers. [Northeast Asia is plagued by territorial and maritime disputes
that are straining political relations both within the region and across
the Pacific]{.underline}. **[[Only one of these
disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[China's opposition to U.S.
involvement in protecting Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[seems
important enough to]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly [[bring the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
China into conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even Taiwan, however, is a
secondary, albeit not insignificant, U.S. interest. Other lesser
disputes are currently roiling China's relationships with many of its
neighbors, but none appear sufficiently significant \[End Page 50\] that
they should derail China's peaceful rise. Nevertheless, recent events
demonstrate that even these seemingly minor disputes---for example, over
the status of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands---can have an outsized negative
impact on U.S.-China relations. Thus, [the question arises whether
accommodation on Taiwan]{.underline} and possibly these still less
important issues [would help keep China's rise peaceful]{.underline},
[while the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continued
to effectively protect its vital interests in the region]{.underline}.

[Accommodation could bring risks of its own]{.underline}. For example,
[it would jeopardize U.S. security if it were to convince China that the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[lacked the resolve]{.mark}** to protect its vital national
interests]{.underline}, **[[leading China to adopt a more assertive
foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This danger would be especially
large if, instead of limited aims, China desired regional hegemony and
was determined to force the United States out of East Asia.
[Accommodation [might also raise **serious concerns among U.S.
allies**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[most importantly]{.underline},
[Japan]{.underline}---[about the reliability of U.S. security
guarantees]{.underline}, thereby **[[undermining
alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are widely judged to be essential
to the security of the United States. Finally, [ending the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [commitment to Taiwan could
sacrifice important U.S. nonsecurity interests]{.underline}, including
support for democracy and individual liberties, [with **[no guarantee of
benefits in return]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[The grand bargain]{.underline}]{.mark} I propose [is designed to
**[capture the benefits of U.S. accommodation with
China]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[while reducing its
risks]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [China's concessions]{.underline} on its
territorial and maritime disputes [would communicate information to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [about the limited
extent of its aims]{.underline}, thereby [reducing Washington's concern
that its own concessions would encourage China to **push the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[out of East
Asia]{.underline}**. In addition, [resolution of these disputes would
**eliminate flash points** that fuel regional military competition and

approach that would enable it to try to push the diplomatic process
forward.

Accommodation on Taiwan would carry a variety of costs and risks for the
United States. The ªrst involves the potential costs to U.S. political
and ideological values. The United States has a signiªcant interest in
promoting and protecting freedom and democracy around the globe. Cutting
the U.S. commitment to Taiwan would put these values at risk. If China
were to gain control International Security 39:4 72 73. Andrew F.

authoritarian government might be unwilling to accept the political
institutions and personal freedoms that Taiwan's people currently enjoy.
Many proponents of preserving the U.S. commitment to Taiwan point to the
importance of protecting these values.77 I agree that these are
important values and that Washington should be reluctant to jeopardize
them. Nevertheless, states usually should, and usually do, give priority
to their key national security interests. The United States should not
be an exception: it should pursue these political and ideological
interests only if the risks to its national security are relatively
small in comparison. The next set of [potential risks concern U.S.
security. The ªrst of these involves possible reductions in China's
assessments of the United States' resolve for protecting its interests
in Northeast Asia]{.underline}. As discussed earlier, [territorial
accommodation can lead an adversary to doubt the state's resolve to
protect other interests, which is dangerous if the state's concessions
do not leave the adversary fully satisfied]{.underline}.78 Two
mechanisms could be at work here. One mechanism depends on China seeing
a similarity across one or more features of the potentially connected
interests, including their geography, the nature and extent of the U.S.
interests, and the U.S. history of involvement with these interests. If
China is uncertain about U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan and other
American interests, and if China believes that similar factors determine
U.S. resolve to protect all of these interests, then accommodation on
Taiwan would reduce U.S. credibility elsewhere. The other mechanism
comes into play if China believes that U.S. accommodation on Taiwan
reºects a change in a factor that also affects U.S. decisions on these
other issues; in that case, U.S. credibility on these issues would be
reduced. The broad change that is currently most relevant is the
shifting balance of power, speciªcally, increasing Chinese military
capabilities in East Asia. [[If China's leaders believe that the United
States chose accommodation]{.mark} on Taiwan in response to China's
growing regional military capabilities, then [they would also]{.mark}
reasonably [conclude that the United States could be expected to make
concessions on other regional issues as

See, for example, Nancy Bernkopf Tucker and Bonnie Glaser, "Should the
United States Abandon Taiwan?" Washington Quarterly, Vol. 34, No. 4
(Fall 2011), p. 34. On the importance that U.S. elites place on
protecting democracy in Taiwan, see Kennedy, "China's Perceptions of the
U.S. Intentions toward Taiwan," pp. 279--282. 78. [Another danger, which
I address below, is that [concessions]{.mark} could increase the
domestic political influence of Chinese proponents of more assertive
policies---including nationalists and the military---thereby
[result]{.mark}ing [in China becoming greedier and more
expansionist]{.mark}]{.underline}. These are standard second-image
reversed arguments. See Peter Gourevitch, "The Second Image Reversed:
The International Sources of Domestic Politics," International
Organization, Vol. 32, No. 4 (Autumn 1978), pp. 881--912; and Charles L.
Glaser, "Political Consequences of Military Strategy: Expanding and
Reªning the Spiral and Deterrence Models," World Politics, Vol. 44, No.
4 (July 1992), pp. 519--525. For discussions that allude to this type of
interaction in the Chinese context, see Kenneth Lieberthal in Lieberthal
and Wang Jisi, "An Overview of the U.S.-China Relationship," in
Hachigian, Debating China, p. 4; and Christensen, "Fostering Stability
or Creating a Monster?" p. 111. These mechanisms are reºected in
prominent arguments against accommodation of Beijing on Taiwan. For
example, [Nancy Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue that "China would respond
to appeasement as have virtually all governments: It would conclude that
a weaker United States lacking vision and ambition could be pressured
and manipulated]{.underline}."79 [Richard Bush argues, "Should the
United States concede to Beijing on Taiwan, the lessons that China would
learn about the intentions of the region's dominant power would likely
discourage moderation and accommodation on other issues, like Korea or
maritime East Asia]{.underline}."80 These are powerful arguments, which
the United States needs to take seriously. [There is a clear similarity
across the disputes---they are all located in East Asia. Thus, China
could be expected to reason that U.S. [accommodation on one of these
disputes indicates a greater willingness to make concessions on all the
others.]{.mark} Arguably, ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan might
even lead China to believe that its growing power will enable its
leadership to convince the United States to fully exit East
Asia]{.underline}. In addition, China's view of the shifting balance of
power could reinforce these conclusions: many Chinese ofªcials believe
that the shifting balance of power partly reºects the failings of the
U.S. domestic political system and the superiority of the China's model
of governance and development; the result is a new international system
in which China's growing power should generate greater inºuence and the
major powers should acknowledge its rising status.81 Because this
transformation inºuences all issues in East Asia, [U.S. accommodation on
Taiwan could validate]{.underline} these [expectations and put other
U.S. interests at greater risk]{.underline}. A second potential threat
to U.S. security is that territorial accommodation could reduce U.S.
military capabilities. Although numerous analysts suggest that China's
control of Taiwan would have this effect, little sustained analysis of
this issue is publically available. One possibility is that U.S.
accommodation would free up military forces and investments that China
now commits to coercing and if necessary attacking Taiwan, which would
in turn enable China to shift resource to better challenge the U.S.
ability to protect the East Asian SLOCs and possibly beyond.82 According
to this argument, because the International Security 39:4 74 79. Tucker

180--181, 186. Taiwan mission has absorbed the vast majority of the
Chinese army's force modernization and organizational training,83 the
resources made available for other missions would be large.84 This
danger is smaller than critics suggest, however. If China decides to
fully pursue more ambitious missions, it would have to make large
investments that would likely dwarf the amount it is spending on
Taiwan-speciªc missions. Consequently, whether China eventually gains
control of Taiwan is unlikely to be decisive in determining China's
ability to invest in efforts to control the South China and East China
Sea SLOCs, and beyond. Related, it is likely that Chinese capabilities
dedicated to Taiwan will eventually become so effective that Beijing
will be able to reallocate some of its future military investment to
other missions.85 Moreover, ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan could
reduce China's determination to pursue more challenging distant naval
missions because the United States will not interrupt these SLOCs,
except possibly during a severe crisis or major war. Eliminating the
possibility of war over Taiwan would therefore greatly reduce Beijing's
incentives to make investments in these missions. China could, however,
pursue greatly expanded power projection capabilities for a variety of
other reasons,86 including worstcase planning that imagines the United
States will interrupt its SLOCs under even the most unlikely conditions,
a Mahanian view of naval power that connects "commercial health with
naval primacy,"87 or the belief that superpower status requires power
projection capabilities.88 Finally, one should not exaggerate the
security risks of being unable to fully control these SLOCs. The United
States does not need to control the Strait of Malacca and the East Asian
SLOCs to enable shipping to reach Japan during a war with China.
Instead, bypass routes could allow shipping to reach oil ports on
Japan's east coast.89 Also, the A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? 75 83. Mark

ability to deny China use of these SLOCs would be sufªcient to preserve
the U.S. ability to coerce China. Taiwan's geographic location creates
another possible military danger by giving China the opportunity to
deploy its forces further forward.90 For example, Chinese control of
Taiwan would provide China's navy more direct access to the open Paciªc,
which might increase China's power project capabilities.91 Chinese
analysts identify the importance of Taiwan for enabling China to "break
through" the barrier created by Japan, including the Ryukyu Islands,
Taiwan, and the Philippines.92 In a similar vein, Toshi Yoshihara and
James Holmes, of the U.S. Naval War College, argue: "Control of
Taiwan\... would allow the PLA to erect its own Great Wall at sea,
giving Beijing some say over the exercise of foreign naval and military
power in nearby seas and skies. . . . Analysts view Taiwan as the one
geographic asset that can grant Chinese forces direct access to the
Paciªc. If the island is a guard tower in an offshore Great Wall, then
its offensive value is unmatched."93 Dissecting the strategic value of
Taiwan requires assessing how Chinese control would inºuence China's
ability to perform speciªc military missions. Available analyses provide
little reason to worry that possession of Taiwan would signiªcantly
increase China's military reach or its ability to project power.94
Control of Taiwan would, however, enhance China's A2/AD capabilities by
increasing its ability to send submarines into the Philippine Sea. Owen
Coté explains that Taiwan plays an important role in enabling the United
States "to form effective acoustic barriers through which Chinese
\[diesel attack submarines/guided missile diesel submarines\] must pass
in transiting" from the shallow waters along China's coast into the deep
water of the Philippine Sea.95 This access is valuable because the
United States plans to operate carrier battle groups in the Philippine
Sea and Chinese diesel submarines would make these operations more
difªcult and riskier. The impact of losing this antiInternational

How would a reduced US security commitment to Taiwan affect the
likelihood of cross-Strait conflict? More concretely, what would happen
if the United States were to terminate arms sales to the island?
Remember that in our simple model conflict occurs if Taiwan claims a
level of sovereign status to the left of point R on the I-U continuum.
How, then, might an end to arms sales affect the probability that
Taiwan's claimed status would lie to the left of point R? Here, we begin
by considering the most intuitive, direct ways that changing levels of
arms sales to Taiwan could affect the parameters of the model and the
associated implications. In the following subsection, we consider more
indirect and nonintuitive effects of ending arms sales, which in turn
serve to qualify points made in this subsection. [Intuitively, it would
seem that US arms sales to Taiwan directly affect both the costs (cc )
that China would expect to pay in a cross-Strait military conflict and
the probability (p) that China would win such a conflict]{.underline}.
On the margins at least, arms sales should improve Taiwan's military
capabilities relative to those of the PRC, thereby reducing p and
increasing cc . Of course, p and cc are determined not simply by the
balance of power between China and Taiwan but also by likely US behavior
in the event of a cross-Strait war: [US intervention would at a minimum
greatly complicate the PRC's ability to prevail in a cross-Strait war
and would certainly increase China's expected costs of such a conflict.
Thus a higher likelihood of US intervention implies a smaller p and a
larger cc . Arms sales to Taiwan, in turn, may signal some level of US
commitment to the island. To the extent that arms sales to Taiwan do in
fact increase confidence in Beijing and Taipei that the United States is
likely to intervene in a cross-Strait conflict, continued US arms sales
to Taiwan imply a smaller p and larger cc than would be the case in the
counterfactual world where the United States did not sell weapons to
Taiwan. These direct effects suggest, then, that ending arms sales
should reduce China's expected costs of war and increase the probability
of PRC victory; R, in turn, should shift to the right. This makes
intuitive sense: to the extent that the balance of power in the Taiwan
Strait favors the PRC, we might expect Beijing to be more demanding on
sovereignty issues]{.underline} (and less tolerant of outcomes that
diverge sharply from its ideal point of unification). [Were R to shift
to the right of Taiwan's actual status, the model suggests that the PRC
would prefer to fight a war rather than to accept a continuation of that
status quo]{.underline}; military conflict would ensue if Taiwan failed
to accommodate this new reality by redefining its sovereign status
(i.e., to push the status This content downloaded from 129.170.195.144

https://about.jstor.org/terms A Farewell to Arms? 229 quo back to the
right of R). [Given the obviously high costs of war for Taiwan---costs
that would presumably be especially high in the absence of any US
security commitment to the island---leaders in Taipei would have strong
incentives to avoid this outcome by bowing to new power realities and
accommodating the PRC on sovereignty issues to some degree. Yet there
are some reasons to think that accommodation in this regard would be
difficult]{.underline}. Recall that in recent decades the primary
strategic challenge in cross-Strait relations can be characterized as a
problem of deterrence, with the PRC trying to deter Taiwan efforts to
redefine its sovereign status in a way that conflicts with PRC hopes for
unification. But if R were to shift right of the status quo, the model
suggests that the cross-Strait relationship would instead be
characterized by a problem of compellence. Here, a war could occur, not
because the PRC fails to deter unilateral Taiwan changes to the status
quo, but rather because the PRC fails to compel Taiwan to alter the
status quo in a way that is more to Beijing's liking (remember that once
R shifts right of the status quo, Beijing's expected war payoff exceeds
its utility for a continuation of the status quo). Nevertheless,
commitment problems could complicate the search for a peaceful
accommodation even if Taiwan recognized that R had moved to the right of
the status quo and even if Taiwan was in principle willing to bargain
away some of its sovereignty.17 The reason is that the issue being
bargained over, Taiwan's sovereign status, could affect future
bargaining power between the two sides: that is, bargaining some of its
sovereign status to avoid war in the short term could further diminish
Taiwan's future bargaining power vis-à-vis Beijing. Even if the United
States were to stop selling arms to Taiwan and renounce any security
commitment to the island, Taiwan would remain qualitatively different
from areas under direct PRC control. It would continue to be
self-governing and democratic, it would continue to maintain armed
forces, and it would---for all intents and purposes---continue to
resemble an independent country on all dimensions except international
legal recognition. But Taiwan's continued otherness in this regard opens
the door to possible US intervention in a cross-Strait conflict even
after a US decision to end its security commitment to Taiwan. Leaders in
Washington, for instance, might revise their view of the PRC, especially
in the aftermath of an attack on Taiwan, and particularly if renouncing
the security commitment entailed a quid pro quo PRC pledge. Thus, even
after the United States ended arms sales to Taiwan and renounced a
security commitment to the island, the probability of US intervention in
a cross-Strait conflict would not drop to zero---in contrast to the
likelihood of US intervention in other areas of China such as Tibet (or,
for that matter, Hong Kong). But the more Taiwan accommodated PRC
demands by allowing itself to become something more resembling Hong Kong
or Tibet than an independent country, then the more the probability of
US intervention would begin to approach zero as it does for other areas

Chapter Twelve PRC control. Such intervention would increasingly, and
unambiguously, represent intervention in a civil, rather than an
international, conflict.18 Thus any bargain involving a reduction in
Taiwan's sovereignty should independently reduce Beijing's expected
costs of war, thus pushing R even further to the right. The credibility
of Beijing's commitment to such a bargain would therefore be suspect, as
once it was implemented Beijing would have incentives to demand an even
more favorable bargain (and Taiwan would not be in a position where it
could refuse). Fearon develops a similar model where states bargain over
strategic territory and the outcome of the negotiations explicitly
shifts the balance of power.19 This change in the balance of power
happens because the outcome of the negotiation transfers territory to a
rival state and thereby improves that rival's fighting capacity. When
this type of dynamic is at work, reaching a settlement becomes difficult
because the consequence of the shift in power caused by a settlement may
be less desirable than fighting and forgoing any negotiations. Although
a hypothetical bargain between the PRC and Taiwan is not over strategic
territory, it is certainly possible that a similar dynamic is at work as
the PRC and Taiwan negotiate over Taiwan's sovereignty. Inasmuch as
giving up sovereignty to the PRC strengthens the PRC's bargaining
leverage, Taiwan may come to the conclusion that risking war is
preferable to any negotiated settlement with the PRC over unification.
In other words, Taiwan may conclude that it would be better to roll the
dice in a war with China today than to accept the terms of an
obsolescing bargain likely to result in a progressively more subordinate
status within a unified China. Therefore, in the same way that
bargaining over strategic territory is complicated by the strategic
consequences of any deal that might be struck, bargaining over
unification can be dangerous because it has implications for the future
bargaining power of the PRC and Taiwan. In summary, ending arms sales to
Taiwan would have the potential to increase instability in the Taiwan
Strait. Such a shift in US policy could alter the balance of power in
the Taiwan Strait, which in turn could shift the strategic dynamic from
deterrence to compellence. In turn, there are reasons to believe that a
China-Taiwan relationship in which China tried to compel steps toward
unification would be more conflict prone than one where the PRC tried to
deter Taiwan steps toward independence, as credible commitment problems
could make it difficult for Taiwan to accommodate new power realities.
WHY ENDING US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE
DESTABILIZING The analysis above suggests that ending arms sales to
Taiwan would be destabilizing if doing so had enough of an effect on p
and cc to push R to the right of the This content downloaded from
129.170.195.144 on Thu, 11 Jul 2019 13:43:00 UTC All use subject to
https://about.jstor.org/terms A Farewell to Arms? 231 status quo.
However, there are reasons to question whether ending sales would indeed
have such a large effect. On the one hand, as the balance of power in
the Taiwan Strait continues to shift in China's favor, it is not obvious
that the arms themselves have a large impact on that shifting power
balance. Whether the sales do in fact have a significant effect in this
regard, moreover, will likely depend heavily on the types of weapons the
United States would be willing to sell to Taiwan (and which weapons
Taiwan would be willing to buy). For instance, some have suggested that
Taiwan's efforts to purchase high-profile and expensive packages such as
the F-16C/D fighter are counterproductive given their high cost and the
PRC's growing air capabilities; according to these analysts, more
mundane (and cheaper) systems are likely to be more effective at
countering PRC capabilities.20 Whether ending arms sales has a
significant effect on p and cc , then, will hinge in part on what types
of weapons the United States would sell Taiwan if arms sales were to
continue. Likewise, it is not self-evident how large of a signaling
effect arms sales have. As we show in the next section, US arms sales
send the clearest signal of US support for Taiwan when the sales are
costly for the United States to undertake. Yet it is quite clear not
only that the sales do not appear to be especially costly for Washington
but also that many in the United States actually benefit economically
and politically from the sales. When the Obama administration was
considering the F-16C/D package in 2011, for instance, a large number of
US senators signed a letter to the president urging the sale to go
forward; often, the signatories represented states that stood to benefit
economically from increased demand for the fighter jets.21 In other
words, so long as Chinese retaliation against the United States for
selling weapons remains limited, the costs of the policy to Washington
do not appear especially high. Thus it would not appear to us that arms
sales represent an especially strong signal of US commitment to Taiwan,
meaning that ending the sales would not necessarily lead Taiwan and
China to dramatically alter their assessments of likely US behavior in
the event of a cross-Strait conflict. It is also worth emphasizing that
many factors besides US arms sales to Taiwan determine the value of p
and cc , including Taiwan's indigenous military capabilities, the PRC's
capabilities, the level of economic integration across the Taiwan
Strait, and so forth. The rapid growth in cross-Strait economic
integration and cooperation in recent decades, combined with China's
general integration into global markets, for instance, suggests that the
costs for China of a cross-Strait military confrontation are probably
quite high---even if the PRC would likely win such a confrontation.
Compared to these costs, the dent to cc caused by reduced arms sales
could actually be quite small. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
ending arms sales to Taiwan could actually increase cc in some ways.

sales [might simply whet the appetite of China and encourage further
demands on the United States, it is also conceivable---**as proponents
such as Glaser argue**---that ending arms sales would lead to
significant improvement in the US-China relationship]{.underline}.22
Furthermore, whether the United States sells weapons to Taiwan or not,
it is hard to imagine a strong and cooperative US-China relationship
withstanding PRC coercion against the island. Therefore, if the PRC
values a stable US-China relationship, and if ending arms sales to
Taiwan does in fact lead to an improved Sino-American relationship, then
ending arms sales to Taiwan will also mean that the PRC will have more
to lose (in terms of a strong US-China relationship) by initiating
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. [If this sort of effect outweighs the
direct effect of ending arms sales on China's costs of war, then ending
arms sales could help to reinforce a stable status quo]{.underline}.
SUMMARY In sum, even in the context of our highly stylized and
simplified model of crossStrait relations, changes in US policy have
complex and uncertain net implications for stability in the Taiwan
Strait. Analysts should recognize that ending arms sales to Taiwan could
be highly destabilizing: such a change in US policy could help to tip
cross-Strait relations from a relatively stable deterrence relationship
to an unstable compellence relationship. But ending arms sales will not
necessarily have this effect and could actually contribute to stability
in the Taiwan Strait by reinforcing China's stake in a stable status
quo. It is our hope that our model will help to organize thinking around
this important topic, by showing how different types of effects fit
together

over whether the United States is doing too little or too much to
confront China. Despite this intense focus, the United States has yet to
confront fully the most challenging question posed by China's rise:
Should the United States pursue a strategy of limited geopolitical
accommodation to avoid conflict?2 Instead, U.S. policy continues to
focus entirely on preserving the geopolitical status quo in Northeast
Asia. This article argues that a more fundamental revision of U.S.
policy is needed. Specially, [[the United States should negotiate a
grand bargain]{.mark} that ends its commitment to defend Taiwan against
Chinese aggression. [In return, China would peacefully resolve its
maritime and land disputes in the South China and East China
Seas]{.mark}, and officially accept the United States' long-term
military security role in East Asia]{.underline}. [U.S. accommodation of
China deserves serious analysis for two reasons. First, both intuition
and international relations theory suggest that a rising power,
especially one that has experienced tremendous growth, can reasonably
expect to increase its geopolitical influence and more fully achieve its
goals, especially when these goals involve its national security.
Bargaining theories maintain that the probability of war is greater when
there is a larger disparity between the distribution of benefits in the
existing territorial status quo and the balance of power.3 Accommodation
that reduces this disparity can, under some conditions, reduce the
probability of war and increase the declining state's security. Second,
the pressures created by the international structure---the combination
of material and information conditions that constrain states'
international options---should allow China to rise peacefully, which,
somewhat counterintuitively, increases the potential importance of
accommodation. If the international structure were driving the United
States and China toward a major conflict, the concessions required of
the United States would be extremely large and costly. Even then, they
might do little to moderate the intense competition. But, because the
international structure is not creating such intense pressures,
[concessions that do not compromise vital U.S. interests may have the
potential to greatly diminish growing strains in U.S.-China
relations]{.mark}, thereby [moderating]{.mark} [future military and
foreign policy competition]{.mark} between the two powers. More
concretely, regional dangers dwarf international structural dangers.
Northeast Asia is plagued by territorial and maritime disputes that are
straining political relations both within the region and across the
Pacific. [Only]{.mark} one of these disputes---[China's opposition to
U.S. involvement]{.mark} in protecting Taiwan---[seems important]{.mark}
enough to possibly bring the United States and China into
conflict]{.underline}. Even Taiwan, however, is a secondary, albeit not
insignificant, U.S. interest. Other lesser disputes are currently
roiling China's relationships with many of its neighbors, but none
appear sufficiently significant

Over the past dec- ade, China's rise has generated much attention,
admiration, and concern. Whether China can rise peacefully remains a
heavily debated issue, with polit- ical scientists worrying about the
dangers of power transitions, aspiring re- gional hegemons, and growing
nationalism. In response to China's economic and military growth, the
administration of Barack Obama has rebalanced U.S. foreign and security
policy toward Asia, a decision that is generating consider- able debate
over whether the United States is doing too little or too much to
confront China. Despite this intense focus, the United States has yet to
confront fully the most challenging question posed by China's rise:
Should the United States pursue a strategy of limited geopolitical
accommodation to avoid conflict? In- stead, [U.S. policy continues to

but none appear sufficiently significant that they should derail China's
peaceful rise. Nevertheless, recent events dem- onstrate that even these
seemingly minor disputes---for example, over the status of the
Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands---can have an outsized negative impact on
U.S.-China relations. Thus, the question arises whether [accommodation
on Taiwan]{.underline} and possibly these still less important issues
[would help keep China's rise peaceful, while the United States
continued to effectively protect its vital interests in the
region.]{.underline}

[Ongoing rival claims over the sovereignty of islands, their related
territorial waters, and derived exclusive economic zones (EEZs) have
generated extensive and complicated disputes in the South China
Sea]{.underline} (see Figure 1). This includes a dispute over names:
China calls this maritime area the "Southern Sea" (Nan Hai), Vietnam
calls it the "Eastern Sea" (Bien Dong), and the Philippines calls it the
"West Philippines Sea" (Dagat Kanlurang *Pilipinas*). [The dispute
involves]{.underline} Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
Vietnam, as well as [China in the shape of the People's Republic of
China (PRC) and, the Republic of China (Taiwan). Outside powers are also
involved in these waters, primarily in the shape of the
U.S]{.underline}. and, secondarily, India, Japan, and Australia. The
security and [military stakes are high.]{.underline} The regional
organization, the Association for Southeast Nations (ASEAN), has
facilitated some conflict management---in the sense of avoiding too much
military fighting---but has not brokered conflict resolution---i.e.,
end- ing the conflictual claims. Conflict irresolution has been the
result. [In looking at this conflict irresolution]{.underline}, this
article considers interna- tional, regional, and bilateral settings
before returning to the national setting of the PRC. Its concluding
twist is that old-fashioned ["balancing" may be the most effective
management solution in the short term; this may generate long-term
normative changes to bring about resolution]{.underline}, with Track-2

**[S]{.underline}**ea [is among the globe's most vital

hotly contested. To enforce China's claims, Beijing has constructed

Pentagon. [Chinese coast-guard vessels and fishing fleets harass the

Meanwhile, North Korea is a growing threat, expanding its nuclear
arsenal and developing new ballistic missiles to deliver them. Pyongyang
has underscored its ruthlessness by striking beyond its borders, as
seems to be the case in the recent murder in Malaysia of Kim Jong Nam,
the half-brother of North Korea's dictator. After years of failed
diplomacy by Democratic and Republican administrations alike, North
Korea is alarmingly close to being able to strike its neighbors and the
U.S. mainland with nuclear missiles.

growth. **[The region is far more likely instead to become an engine of

War?

http://www.voanews.com/content/will-south-china-sea-dispute-lead-to-world-war/2806950.html)

Gordon Chang, author of The Coming Collapse of China, recently claimed
that **[the South China Sea could become the next "Great War
Zone."]{.underline}** Chang said last week at a panel discussion held by
the U.S. Air Force Association that it will not be long before the U.S.
takes initiatives to respond to China's unyielding attitude and behavior
in the South China Sea. He said the time frame is now. "The U.S. Navy is
clearly going to test China's claims of exclusion of the South China
Sea," Chang said. "We have to do that, because if there has been any
consistent American foreign policy over the course of two centuries, it
has been the defense of freedom of navigation." "Now China is infringing
on that notion at this time," Chang added. "I think we probably will act
in a very short time frame." Chang called it "a classic zero-sum game"
for China to challenge the U.S. in the South China Sea. He said China
sees the South China Sea as one of its core interests with no room for
negotiation, while the U.S. has been the influential maritime power for
the past two centuries. Both could concede on the South China Sea
issues, Chang said, but they will not abandon their long-held positions.
Rick Fisher, senior research fellow at the International Assessment and
Strategy Center, told VOA that attention should also be paid to the
development of nuclear weapons in China and North Korea. He said that
although North Korea stays quiet for now, it is likely to take advantage
of the South China Sea disputes in the foreseeable future. "As soon as
North Korea can demonstrate that it can fire a nuclear missile, then
North Korea becomes a factor because North Korea itself can decide to
take a period of high confrontation in the South China Sea and put
greater pressure on the United States in order to obtain concessions
from South Korea or the U.S. itself." So, Fisher said, "as soon as there
is a crisis, North Korea could become a very dangerous element." Fisher
said although Kim Jong Un has rifts with the Chinese government, both
share and act by the same communist ideology. Well-known American
investor George Soros also expressed concerns about the **[Chinese
aggression in the South China Sea i]{.underline}**n recent months. He
said at a recent World Bank forum that if China suffers economically, it
i[s **likely to initiate a third world war**]{.underline} in order to
achieve national solidarity and to get itself out of the economic
difficulties. [Even if China and the U.S. do not engage in a war
directly,]{.underline} Soros said, [there is a high possibility of
military conflicts between China and]{.underline} one of the U.S.
security partners, [Japan.]{.underline} **[World War III could follow as
a result]{.underline}**, Soros said.

IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. INTERESTS [The United States has significant
political, security, and economic interests at stake]{.underline} if one
of the contingencies should occur. -- Global rules and norms. [The
United States has important interests in the peaceful resolution of
South China Sea disputes according to international law]{.underline}.
With the exception of China, all the claimants of the South China Sea
have attempted to justify their claims based on their coastlines and the
provisions of UNCLOS. China, however, relies on a mix of historic rights
and legal claims, while remaining deliberately ambiguous about the
meaning of the "nine-dashed line" around the sea that is drawn on
Chinese maps. [Failure to uphold international law and norms could harm
U.S. interests elsewhere in the region and beyond.]{.underline}
[Ensuring freedom of navigation is another critical interest of the
United States and other regional states. Although China claims that it
supports freedom of navigation, its insistence that foreign militaries
seek advance permission to sail in its two-hundred-mile EEZ casts doubt
on its stance]{.underline}. China's development of capabilities to deny
American naval access to those waters in a conflict provides evidence of
possible Chinese intentions to block freedom of navigation in specific
contingencies. -- [Alliance security and regional stability. U.S. allies
and friends around the South China Sea look to the United States to
maintain free trade, safe and secure sea lines of communication (SLOCs),
and overall peace and stability in the region]{.underline}. [Claimants
and nonclaimants]{.underline} to land features and maritime waters in
the South China Sea [view the U.S. military presence as necessary to
allow decision-making free of intimidation. If nations in the South
China Sea lose confidence in the United States to serve as the principal
regional security guarantor, they could embark on costly and potentially
destabilizing arms buildups to compensate or, alternatively, become more
accommodating to the demands of a powerful China.]{.underline} Neither
would be in the U.S. interest. [Failure to reassure allies]{.underline}
of U.S. commitments in the region [could also undermine U.S. security
guarantees in the broader Asia-Pacific region, especially with Japan and
South Korea]{.underline}. At the same time, however, the United States
must avoid getting drawn into the territorial dispute---and possibly
into a conflict---by regional nations who seek U.S. backing to
legitimize their claims. -- [Economic interests. Each year, \$5.3
trillion of trade passes through the South China Sea; U.S. trade
accounts for \$1.2 trillion of this total.]{.underline} Should a crisis
occur, the [diversion of cargo ships to other routes would harm regional
economies as a result of an increase in insurance rates]{.underline} and
longer transits. [Conflict of any scale in the South China Sea would
hamper the claimants from benefiting from the South China's Sea's proven
and potential riches]{.underline}. -- Cooperative relationship with
China. The stakes and implications of any U.S.-China incident are far
greater than in other scenarios. [The United States has an abiding
interest in preserving stability in the U.S.-China relationship so that
it can continue to secure Beijing's cooperation on an expanding list of
regional and global issues and more tightly integrate China into the
prevailing international system.]{.underline}

### 2NC ECS War

#### ECS disputes go nuclear

**[Ayson]{.underline}**, Professor of Strategic Studies -- Victoria
University of Wellington, Adjunct Professor -- Australian National
University's Strategic and Defense Studies Center,
11/25/**['14]{.underline}**

(Robert, "Can a Sino-Japanese War Be Controlled?", Survival: Global
Politics and Strategy, Vol. 56, No. 6)

The role of nuclear weapons is one of the most important aspects of the
escalation question in North Asia, as China has a nuclear arsenal and
Japan relies on US extended deterrence. [If Beijing and Tokyo engage in
conventional]{.underline} military [conflict, **the prospects of direct
Sino-American nuclear escalation come into play more
clearly**]{.underline}. [One of the main concerns about]{.underline} the
possibility of such [escalation revolves around America\'s superiority
to China in]{.underline} terms of [conventional]{.underline} fighting
[power]{.underline}.41 While China is closing that gap, some American
conventional systems allow Washington to threaten China with accurate,
destructive strikes that Beijing cannot hope to replicate. [Should
Sino-American hostilities]{.underline} seem likely to [intensify, China
could be tempted to utilise its nuclear forces]{.underline}. In such a
conflict, however, Beijing should be aware that [any attempted nuclear
attack on the US would be]{.underline} almost [guaranteed to generate a
swift and]{.underline} probably [disproportionate nuclear
response]{.underline}. Mutual fear of [surprise attacks and inadvertent
nuclear war could not be ruled out]{.underline}, but nuclear deterrence
might well operate effectively.42

In the early stages of a conflict involving only China and Japan, the
nuclear question takes on a different perspective. Beijing would still
face the prospect of relative conventional-military weakness, especially
when it considered the possibility of American support to Tokyo. But if
China decided to escalate by threatening Japan with nuclear bombardment,
it would have to weigh the credibility of American extended deterrence,
some portion of which would almost certainly swing into action. At the
very least, China would have to deal with the costs of a strong
conventional response by the US.

One might expect that nuclear threats, implicit or otherwise, would
remain in the background. Washington could regard the threat of a
nuclear response as effective leverage, discouraging China from
escalating a conventional conflict with Japan without the need for heavy
US involvement in a conventional military contest. Similarly, China
might remind Japan about the existence of its nuclear forces, so as to
highlight the potential costs of conventional escalation. Testing an
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during early hostilities --
rather like the 2014 Russian test, apparently longscheduled, during the
Ukraine crisis -- could be such a signalling mechanism.

[If China suffers, or]{.underline} merely [fears]{.underline}, a
significant [attack on its command and control systems, there are
other]{.underline} material [reasons why nuclear escalation could become
more likely]{.underline}. Unlike the US or the Soviet Union during the
Cold War, [China lacks separate, redundant theatre and strategic
networks for C4ISR]{.underline}. [This increases the likelihood that
what Japan and]{.underline} especially [the US view as an escalating
conflict in the conventional domain could have]{.underline} quite [a
different appearance to Chinese decision-makers]{.underline}.
**[Conventional escalation could easily cause the US to take measures
that imperilled China\'s]{.underline}** control of its **[nuclear
systems]{.underline}**. Aware of its general C4ISR vulnerability,
Beijing would already have experienced considerable pressure to use its
antisatellite systems, anti-ship ballistic missiles (including the
DF21-D) and other anti-carrier weapons, and to accelerate its cyber
attacks.43 The US would likely respond to the use of these capabilities
by destroying all remaining Chinese force elements in any way connected
to them, which would have further C4ISR implications for China. America
could be expected to forgo attacks on Chinese urban--industrial centres
and many other force elements. Washington would seek to convey restraint
and selectivity in its response, but would already have provided Beijing
with a perverse incentive to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively, out of
fear that its capacity to maintain command and control of these systems
was being destroyed in the conventional conflict.

The concentrated, limited range of China\'s nuclear-powered
ballisticmissile submarines (SSBNs) and associated command, control and
communications systems would become an attractive target for the US soon
after the nuclear threshold had been crossed. China only has three SSBN
bases, which are also used by its attack submarines. Its single
Xia-class SSBN is based at Jianggezhuang, around 24km east of Qingdao,
and may never have become operational.44 The base also houses several
nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs), meaning that either
conventional or nuclear strikes on China\'s attack submarines could also
be interpreted as an attack on the Xia.45 The Chinese navy currently has
five Type-094 Jin-class SSBNs, which have 12 JL-2 submarine-launched
ballistic missiles each, and share two home ports. The first two vessels
in this class were based at Xiaopingdao, near Dalian in Liaoning
Province.46 Since December 2007, Jin SSBNs have also been seen moored at
Yulin naval base near Sanya (in Yalong Bay, on the southern coast of
Hainan Island), which reportedly has large underground facilities for
holding SSBNs.47 Moreover, the Chinese navy normally uses only two
high-powered VLF stations for communications with its SSBNs and attack
submarines. These are located at Changde and at the Datong naval base.
Although the navy has another six VLF stations that it could also use
(located at Fuzhou, Lushun, Qinghe, Yaxian, Yulin and Zhanjiang), they
make up part of a vulnerable infrastructure that could easily be
degraded.48

China\'s overlapping command arrangements and the co-location of some of
its main conventional and nuclear systems present particular escalatory
challenges. The PLA\'s Second Artillery Corps, for example, controls all
of China\'s land-based missiles, including conventional and
nuclear-armed missiles, and both ballistic-and cruise-missile forces.
The eight bases holding ICBMs also contain a mixture of intermediate-and
medium-range ballistic missiles, meaning that an attack on one is likely
to threaten the others. The Second Artillery Corps is headquartered just
north of Beijing. It has an alternative base in the hardened facility
under Yuquan Shan Mountain, which is located in the Western Hills just
outside the capital and is also used by the Central Military Commission.
As a result, the degradation or destruction of the headquarters of the
Second Artillery Corps could also substantially impair the commission\'s
national command-and-control capabilities.

[In the knowledge that its nuclear systems could]{.underline} also [be
affected by an early strike]{.underline} against conventional
command-and-control systems, **[China might face]{.underline}** complex
**[temptations to use them while it]{.underline}** still
**[could]{.underline}** (even if they were not targeted directly),
[where the alternative was to cope with]{.underline} major
[uncertainties about what it might be left with]{.underline} as the war
escalated. According to the US Department of Defense, the PLAN has a
limited capacity to communicate with submarines at sea, and Beijing has
no operational experience of managing a fleet of SSBNs conducting
strategic-deterrence patrols.49 Renmin University\'s Wu Riqiang has
argued that existing Chinese SSBNs are too noisy to operate beyond the
first island chain, where they would have a higher chance of
successfully striking the continental US.50 By comparison, the shallower
waters around mainland China have a much more complex acoustic
environment, which could hamper submarine-detection efforts. Owen Cote,
Jr, suggests that these waters would in a conflict situation 'constitute
a zone of "contested command" in which neither side can assure its use
of the sea surface for either commercial or military purposes'.51

Forced to launch from these shallower waters, China\'s relatively small
SSBN force would likely be countered by US (and, increasingly, Japanese)
ballistic-missile defence systems, and would hardly present Beijing with
a secure second-strike capability. As Wu suggests, 'China\'s SSBNs are
much more vulnerable than those of the Soviet Union. **[China\'s leaders
will face a much harder "use it or lose it" choice during a
crisis]{.underline}**. [The situation is more dangerous than during the
Cold War]{.underline}.'52

Moreover, [in the event of much more serious escalation]{.underline}
from the other side, [China would find it exceedingly difficult to
distinguish a deliberately crafted, limited nuclear strike]{.underline}
by the US [from a full-scale urban--industrial attack]{.underline}.
Since the 1960s, US nuclear-war plans have contained various options for
the use of strategic nuclear weapons against China; by the early years
of the George W. Bush administration, these ranged from limited attacks
in response to conflicts involving Taiwan and North Korea to
larger-scale efforts in which as many as 500 nuclear missiles would be
launched at the full range of Chinese nuclear-weapons sites,
conventional military bases, industrial areas and leadership
facilities.53

A more recent nuclear-war plan for a reduced US arsenal (which came into
effect in July 2012) is organised around four categories of nuclear
attack and contains dozens of limited options.54 [In the context of an
escalating war that had **begun as a small conflict between Japan and
China**, the US would]{.underline} presumably [have]{.underline} at
least [three different targeting missions in mind]{.underline}. These
would include attacks that met the extended-deterrence commitment to
Japan by destroying conventional targets and preventing China from
gaining the ascendancy; strikes on all facilities associated with a
Chinese assault on US satellites, aircraft carriers and undersea
sensors; and a response to Chinese nuclear pre-emption.55 [Coupled with
Beijing\'s diminished ability to judge the limits of a US
strike]{.underline} after its C4ISR systems had been damaged, [this
intermixture of conventional and nuclear targets creates a worrying
escalatory picture]{.underline}. **[An Asian nuclear war would be very
difficult to control]{.underline}**.

Once the US and the Soviet Union had reached a political stalemate and
informally acknowledged their common interest in avoiding a catastrophic
war, worries about escalation tended to include the possibility that
technical rather than political factors would allow a small conflict to
get out of hand. There were varying assessments of the ease with which a
war between the superpowers could be controlled in light of the
vulnerability of their command systems, but political factors were
rarely seen as a major, independent cause for concern.

[In the]{.underline} strategic [relationship between Japan and
China]{.underline}, however, [there are problems]{.underline} at both
the political and military--technical levels. Firstly, [there seems to
be minimal political understanding of]{.underline}, or commitment to,
[avoiding escalation]{.underline}. [It is hard to tell whether Japan and
China will see it as in their]{.underline} political [interests to
constrain]{.underline} what begins as a [minor conflict]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} political obstacles [increase the pressure
created]{.underline} by military considerations [that encourage swift
escalation, **to the point at which**]{.underline} even **[nuclear
options seem attractive]{.underline}**. The close military links between
Japan and the US would not necessarily encourage restraint. [It may
be]{.underline} militarily [logical for the US to place China in a
position in which further escalation seemed tempting]{.underline}, while
it could be politically logical for Japan to create conditions in which
American action became more likely.

An initial [outbreak of hostilities between Japan and China over the
East China Sea]{.underline} could remain just that: a short, contained
exchange of fire and a sobering lesson that encouraged much-needed
efforts to improve communication and recognise their common interest in
avoiding conflict. But it [might]{.underline} also [veer out of
control]{.underline} before they had a chance to take preventative
measures. The [subsequent involvement of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could lead to **Asia\'s first serious war
involving nuclear-armed states**]{.underline}. And we have no precedent
to suggest how dangerous that would become.

Japan and America?",

**[Big wars sometimes start over small stakes.]{.underline}** For
instance, Germany's "Iron Chancellor," Otto von Bismarck, presciently
warned that a European war would begin as a result of "some damned
foolish thing in the Balkans." Soon, [a royal assassination]{.underline}
spawned World War I, which [spread conflict around the
globe.]{.underline}

**[National insults, trade opportunities and territorial claims also
resulted in their share of]{.underline}** stupid, **[counterproductive
conflicts]{.underline}**. The assertive young American republic
threatened Great Britain with war over the Canadian border and launched
an invasion to vindicate its dubious territorial claims against Mexico.
A few decades later, the slightly more mature United States fought a
lengthy counterinsurgency campaign against independence-minded Filipinos
to preserve its territorial booty from the Spanish-American War.

**[Alliances sometimes accelerate the race to war]{.underline}**.
Assured of the support of Russia and Germany, respectively, Serbia and
the Austro-Hungarian Empire were recklessly intransigent in summer 1914.
Greater flexibility might not have prevented the conflict, but
alliance-backed inflexibility ensured war.

**[History illustrates the dangers posed by the
Asia-Pacific's]{.underline}** many **[territorial
squabbles]{.underline}**. [None of the contested claims is worth a
fight, let alone a **great-power conflict**]{.underline}. **[Yet they
could become a spark like that in Sarajevo]{.underline}** a century ago.
Defense Secretary Jim [Mattis **increased the danger** on his recent
trip to Japan when he "reassured" the Abe government]{.underline} that
[Washington]{.underline}, DC [was firmly in its corner.]{.underline}

**[The Senkaku Islands]{.underline}**---called the Diaoyus by
China---are uninhabited rocks of limited intrinsic value. However, they
**[confer ocean and seabed control and corresponding fishing, navigation
and hydrocarbon benefits]{.underline}**. **[Nationalist sentiments
loom]{.underline}** equally **[large]{.underline}**. The islands are
controlled by Tokyo but also claimed by the People's Republic of China.
Beijing's case is serious---better, in my view, than its less credible
South China Sea claims---but Japan insists that there is no issue to
discuss.

**[That leaves the PRC with little choice but to adopt more
confrontational tactics to assert its "rights."]{.underline}** Tokyo
took direct control of the Senkaku Islands in 2012 to forestall their
use by nationalists for protests, which heightened tensions. The
following year, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone over
the islands, though so far the ADIZ has more symbolic than real. The PRC
also has engaged in fishing and oil exploration in nearby waters,
sending in coast guard ships to defend Chinese operations.

Japan felt secure in its intransigence after winning the Obama
administration's commitment that the "mutual" defense treaty between the
two nations covered territory administered by the central government,
even if claimed by other states. Secretary Mattis was equally explicit.
He affirmed not only Washington's support for Japan's defense, but also
stated, "I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku
Islands stands. The United States will continue to recognize Japanese
administration of the islands, and as such Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty applies." In other words, America will defend Tokyo's
contested claim.

The PRC responded sharply. The United States should "avoid making the
issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional
situation," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. Indeed, he
explained, the U.S.-Japan security treaty is "a product of the Cold War,
which should not impair China's territorial sovereignty and legitimate
rights."

**[Adding to the combustible atmosphere is the apparent
belief]{.underline}**---**[of]{.underline}** at least **[some officials
on both sides]{.underline}**---**[that war is inevitable]{.underline}**.
For instance, less than a year ago Trump strategist Steve Bannon
expressed "no doubt" that "we're going to war in the South China Sea in
five to ten years." He complained that the Chinese are "taking their
sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting
missiles on those." While the Senkaku Islands are not part of the South
China Sea, the same principles apply.

War sounded almost close at Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's
confirmation hearing. He insisted: "We're going to have to send China a
clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your
access to those islands also is not going to be allowed." Using force to
do so would be an act of war against any country, including America.

Chinese responded accordingly. The People's Liberation Army website
quoted one senior officer as stating: "A 'war within the president's
term' or 'war breaking out tonight' are not just slogans, they are
becoming a practical reality." He called for increased military
deployments in the region.

The political leadership is less transparent about its views---the
residents of Zhongnanhai don't typically appear on radio shows. However,
Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group opined that "**[the Chinese government
is quite concerned about]{.underline}** the **[potential for direct
confrontation with the Trump administration]{.underline}**." Although
President Xi Jinping appears reasonably pragmatic while ruthlessly
repressive, he isn't likely to abandon what he sees as "core" Chinese
interests. Moreover, **[nationalists and unreconstructed
leftists]{.underline}**, though differing on economic policy, **[share a
distrust of the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

A **[mutual belief in]{.underline}** inevitable **[conflict could become
reality]{.underline}**. [Before World War I, a number of high-ranking
European officials believed that war was coming]{.underline}. For them,
[it made sense to]{.underline} accept, even [embrace, the onset of the
conflict]{.underline} in August 1914 [and **strike while victory still
remained possible.**]{.underline}

In the case of China versus the United States, such **[shared sentiment
may accelerate military spending]{.underline}**. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is demanding increased outlays]{.underline} despite the
lack of any serious threat to vital U.S. interests. Rather, the expanded
force is to enhance America's ability to intervene against other
nations, particularly China.

[This gives the PRC]{.underline} an [even greater incentive to
respond]{.underline}, since the United States is challenging what it
views (and America would view, if the situation was reversed) as "core"
national interests. As the United States increases military deployments
in the region, so will the PRC. After Mattis' visit, China sent three
warships near the Senkaku Islands. **[The risks of a violent clash will
rise accordingly.]{.underline}**

Some Washington officials might be tempted to advocate a more aggressive
approach today, while the PRC is weaker and America is wealthier, backed
by numerous allies and able to deploy a more powerful military. In this
view, let the inevitable showdown come sooner rather than later.

Alas, that could become a prescription for years if not decades of
conflict. America has a vital interest in protecting its own territory,
population, and constitutional and economic systems. But China threatens
none of them. The United States has important interests in the
independence of its allies and freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific
region. So far, the PRC has not challenged either of those things.

Washington understandably views its dominance of East Asia up to China's
borders as an advantage. But it is far less important than protecting
America's own security. Such control is not even necessary for
preserving navigational freedom and allied security. More important,
U.S. policy conflicts with what Beijing views as its "core" interests.
Imagine Washington's reaction if China attempted to maintain a similar
position along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. [Nor does the
presumption that America could defeat the PRC offer much
comfort.]{.underline} **[The price would be high. China can build
missiles and submarines faster than the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[can construct aircraft carriers. The Chinese
people would be more committed to a fight]{.underline}** if it is seen
as protecting their homeland---more so than Americans would be prone to
getting involved in a faraway conflict that hampers Washington's will.

Additionally, the United States count on support from allies not
directly affected. Would Australia and South Korea risk the long-term
hostility of China, which will be in their next-door neighbor forever?
Indeed, Japan made clear that it would not join the United States'
"freedom of navigation operations" in the South China Sea. Explained
Japanese defense minister Tomomi Inada: "I told Secretary Mattis that
Japan supports the U.S. military's freedom of navigation operation in
the sea. But the \[Self Defense Force\] will not be sent to the area."
Inada clearly means "supports" in quotation marks.

Finally, **[an American "victory"]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[would guarantee long-term hostility and future
conflict]{.underline}**. It took two world wars to determine Germany's
place in the global order. And it took "only" two because, after the
second one, Germany ended up divided and well behind the United States
and Soviet Union. While the PRC's collapse as a country is possible, it
is unlikely. **[In fact, military defeat might spur nationalist rage and
result in greater centralization.]{.underline}**

[The Communist regime could fall. But that probably would spawn an
authoritarian government rather than a democracy. And any democracy is
more likely to be nationalist/populist than liberal]{.underline}.
Whether the almost inevitable "Second Sino-American War" likely would
turn out in Washington's favor is less clear. There could be a third one
as well, if China rebounded. The United States might find that just as
battles can be pyrrhic, so can wars. It's an experience America should
avoid.

U.S. officials have good reason to remind China of the costs of conflict
and the importance of settling even contentious territorial disputes
peacefully. At the same time, however, the Trump administration should
avoid issuing blank checks to allies seeming to exempt them from having
to deal with, and even discuss, those same territorial challenges.
Sometimes blank checks get cashed with disastrous consequences, like
Imperial Germany's support for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which sped
Europe's plunge into the World War I abyss.

**[The Senkaku Islands are of little practical importance]{.underline}**
to China and Japan, and essentially of no importance to America. **[But
as the locus of a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken, they could
spark another Sino-Japanese war, which would be
disastrous]{.underline}**. **[And if that turned into a Sino-American
conflict, the consequences would be incalculable]{.underline}**.
President Donald Trump should never forget these dangers as he confronts
China's growing ambition and power.

Taiwan makes coop impossible but the CP solves

**Glaser**, professor in the Elliott School of International Affairs and

Center for Scholars, **'15**

(Charles L., "A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? The Hard Choice between
Military Competition and Accommodation," International Security Volume
39, Number 4, Spring 2015)

TAIWAN IS NO LONGER THE KEY ISSUE

**[A second counterargument is that Taiwan is no longer the key issue
straining U.S.-China relations.]{.underline}** Consequently, focusing on
Taiwan is misguided. As discussed earlier, [cross-strait relations have
been improving for many years]{.underline}. [At the same time, China\'s
disputes with its neighbors in the South China and East China Seas have
become more intense]{.underline}, and increasingly define day-to-day
tensions in the region. Possibly most worrisome, Sino-Japanese relations
have become increasingly strained in the past few years, taking the
spotlight off Taiwan.

[Two rejoinders help to put this counterargument into
perspective]{.underline}. As I have already argued, [the dangers
generated by the U.S. commitment to Taiwan go **well beyond** **the
immediate possibility of the United States fighting China to protect
Taiwan**]{.underline} and, therefore, **[are not adequately captured by
focusing solely on the cross-strait relationship]{.underline}**. [The
U.S. commitment]{.underline} [to Taiwan is among the **key
factor**]{.underline}s [fueling **Chinese doubts about U.S. motives in
the region**]{.underline} [and Chinese worries about a war over Taiwan
make **control of the Northeast Asian SLOCs** far more important. These
worries contribute to **military competition and strained political
relations**]{.underline}, thereby **[increasing the probability of
conflict over the longer term.]{.underline}** Second, [a grand bargain
would **deal fully** with this]{.underline} counterargument by requiring
resolution of these other disputes.

#### Extinction---The CP's model prevents global nuclear war, proliferation, and warming

**Goldstein**, associate professor and founding director, China Maritime
Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May **2015**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 360-1)

[Great power rivalry is a force of nature that is nearly impossible to
control]{.underline}. [Its dynamics are amply clear in contemporary
US-China relations]{.underline}. However, [thinking and responsible
people need not accept **war**]{.underline}, rivalry, and the inability
to cooperate **[as inevitable outcomes]{.underline}**. [The imperative
to prevent an **apocalyptic World War**]{.underline} III, [the obvious
dangers of regional conflict flowing from **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}, [and the ever-clearer menace of **global
warming** must inspire us to collectively struggle against the
inexorable drive toward intensified US-China rivalry]{.underline}. One
model [to escape this]{.underline} perverse [dynamic]{.underline} is
provided in this book in the form of "**[cooperation
spirals]{.underline}**," which [are built on]{.underline} the principles
of gradualism, **[reciprocity]{.underline}**, **[and mutual
compromise]{.underline}**. [This **model** can be adapted to restrain
**all aspects of US-China rivalry**]{.underline}, from the South China
Sea to the Korean Peninsula and from economic tensions to climate change
negotiations. Such steps toward compromise can be debated and altered,
reversed and reformulated. Here, one hundred steps are suggested; but
there are thousands of alternative steps that need to be suggested,
examined, and refined. Indeed, Steinberg and O'Hanlon's 2014 book
usefully proposes a whole panoply of alternatives, ranging from
traditional arms control efforts to a "cyber risk reduction center,"
which deserve careful consideration and might also fit well into
"cooperation spirals." 59 I do not for a minute underestimate the
difficulties involved in negotiating these painful compromises, which
will necessarily involve "games" on at least two levels, international
and domestic.

#### Specifically, key to warming

**Goodell 14**

Jeff Goodell is an American author and contributing editor to Rolling
Stone magazine, The Rolling Stone, September 15, 2014, "China, the
Climate and the Fate of the Planet",
http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/china-the-climate-and-the-fate-of-the-planet-20140915

[For nearly a decade, the U.S. and China]{.underline}, the two most
powerful nations on the planet, [have met every year to talk about how
to run the world together.]{.underline} When the talks began in 2006,
they focused on issues like currency-exchange rates, trade barriers and
China\'s never-ending disputes with Taiwan. In 2009, shortly after
Obama\'s inauguration, [the U.S. pushed to add climate change to the
mix]{.underline}, hoping that a better understanding between the U.S.
and China would lead to a better deal at the Copenhagen climate summit
that year. ([It didn\'t help -- **mistrust between the countries** was a
large part of the reason why the talks imploded.]{.underline})

This year\'s U.S. delegation includes many of the administration\'s most
influential climate hawks -- Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, top climate
negotiator Todd Stern and John Podesta, counselor to Obama, who has
become the administration\'s de facto point man for climate policy. This
is the diplomatic equivalent of a full-court press. In the past couple
of years, [Obama has made some important moves, including investing
billions in clean energy, jacking up vehicle-efficiency standards and
proposing rules to limit pollution]{.underline} from U.S. coal plants.
**[But climate change is a global issue. Unless the West can persuade
other countries to take climate action seriously, nothing any single
nation does is going to matter much when it comes to solving the
problem.]{.underline}**

[Except]{.underline}, that is, [for China.]{.underline} The blunt truth
is that **[what China decides to do in the next decade will likely
determine whether or not]{.underline}** ~~mankind~~ **[humanity can halt
-- or at least ameliorate -- global warming.]{.underline}** [The view
among]{.underline} a number of [prominent climate scientists is that if
China\'s emissions peak around 2025, we may]{.underline} -- **[just
barely]{.underline}** -- **[have a shot at stabilizing the climate
before all hell breaks loose. But the Chinese have resisted
international pressure to curb]{.underline}** their
**[emissions.]{.underline}** For years, they have used the argument that
they are poor, the West is rich, and that the high levels of carbon in
the atmosphere were caused by America\'s and Europe\'s 200-year-long
fossil­fuel binge. Climate change is your problem, they argued -- you
deal with it. But that logic doesn\'t hold anymore. [China is set to
become the largest economy in the world]{.underline} this year,
[and]{.underline} in 2006, [it passed the U.S. as the planet\'s largest
carbon polluter. China now dumps 10 billion tons of CO2 into the
atmosphere every year.]{.underline} **[That number is expected to grow
to 15 billion tons by 2030]{.underline}**, ~~dwarfing~~ the pollution of
the rest of the world. If that happens, then **[the chances that the
world will cut carbon pollution quickly enough to avert dangerous
climate change is]{.underline}**, according to Kevin Anderson, deputy
director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in the U.K.,
**[\"virtually zero.\"]{.underline}**

John Kerry knows this. He also knows that [when the nations of the world
gather in Paris next December to try to hammer out a global climate
agreement]{.underline}, **[it may be the last best chance to address
this problem]{.underline}** before the Years of Living Dangerously
begin. Like other climate negotiations held under the banner of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, [the Paris
meeting is likely to be warped by 25-year-old grudges and a profound
sense of distrust. \"But right now, Paris is the only game we
have]{.underline},\" one member of the State Department\'s climate team
told me. \"If it fails, there is no Plan B.\"

In Beijing, one of Kerry\'s goals will be to find out all he can about
China\'s strategy for Paris -- what kind of commitment the Chinese might
make, how sincere they are, what tactics they will use. But for Kerry,
**[this]{.underline}** is anything but a straightforward
**[conversation]{.underline}**, because **[it\'s twisted up in the
shadow play of U.S.-China relations, which are marked by
suspicion]{.underline}**, paranoia **[and saber rattling]{.underline}**
on both sides as the U.S. adjusts to China\'s rising power in the world.
\"What we are living through now is the end of 500 years of Western
predominance,\" historian Niall Ferguson has written. The issue is not
whether China will challenge America\'s dominance, but when and how.

In the Online Journal of Space Communication, Dr. Feng [Hsu, a NASA
scientist]{.underline} at Goddard Space Flight Center, a research center
[in the **forefront of science of space and Earth,**]{.underline}
[writes]{.underline}, "The [evidence of global warming is
alarming]{.underline}," noting [the potential for a catastrophic
planetary climate change is real]{.underline} and troubling (Hsu 2010).
Hsu and his NASA colleagues were engaged in monitoring and analyzing
cli- mate changes on a global scale, through which they received
first-hand scientific information and data relating to global warming
issues, including the dynamics of polar ice cap melting. [After
discussing this research with colleagues who were world experts on the
subject, he wrote]{.underline}: **[I now have no doubt global
temperatures are rising, and that global warming is a serious problem
confronting all of humanity]{.underline}**. No matter whether these
trends are due to human interference or to the cosmic cycling of our
solar system, there are two basic facts that are crystal clear: (a)
[there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing positive correlations
between the level of CO2 concentrations in Earth's atmosphere with
respect to the historical fluctuations of global temperature
changes]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} (b) **[the overwhelming
majority]{.underline}** [of the world's scientific community is in
agreement about the risks of a potential catastrophic global climate
change]{.underline}. That is, [if we humans continue to ignore this
problem]{.underline} and do noth- ing, if we continue dumping huge
quantities of greenhouse gases into Earth's biosphere, **[humanity will
be at dire risk]{.underline}** (Hsu 2010). [As a technology risk
assessment expert]{.underline}, [Hsu]{.underline} says he [can show with
some confi- dence that **the planet will face more risk doing nothing**
to curb its fossil-based energy addictions than it will in making a
fundamental shift in its energy supply]{.underline}. "This," he writes,
"is because [the risks of a catastrophic anthropogenic climate change
can be potentially **the extinction of human species**]{.underline}, a
risk [that is simply too high for us to take any chances]{.underline}"
(Hsu 2010). It was this NASA scientist's conclusion that humankind must
now embark on the next era of "sustainable energy consumption and
re-supply, the most obvious source of which is the mighty energy
resource of our Sun" (Hsu 2010) (Fig. 2.1).

#### U.S.-China conflict is inevitable without the counterplan---Key to cooperation spiral

**Goldstein**, associate professor and founding director, China Maritime
Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May **2015**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 330-333)

[US-China relations remain mired in suspicion]{.underline} regrettably.
[While any forward progress is welcome]{.underline}, of course, [the
steps cited]{.underline} above [are mostly symbolic]{.underline},
representing, for the most part, [repackaging of longheld policies
rather than **genuine negotiated compromises**]{.underline}. The
measures emerging from [the late 2014 summit will]{.underline}
unfortunately [not stabilize the relationship over the long
term]{.underline}, nor provide definitive solutions to the most grave
issues confronting the relationship and global security more generally.
[These measures]{.underline} may simply move the relationship from
deeply fraught to extremely tense and [will do little to
break]{.underline} down [the veritable chasm of strategic mistrust that
presently divides Washington and Beijing]{.underline}. In the strategic
realm, since 2011 Washington has embarked on a "rebalancing to the
Asia-Pacific," while Beijing seems ever more determined to press its
maritime claims and simultaneously believes that the United States is
determined to contain and stifle China's rise. Most troubling of all,
[the military establishments in both the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and [China each appears to]{.underline} hold that
they must earnestly [prepare for]{.underline} rivalry and even **[direct
conflict]{.underline}**.

Although, for the moment, the relationship is still guided by
pragmatists, [there is no denying a certain intense
loathing]{.underline}--- extant in the larger body politic, but also
felt intensely among political elites and bureaucrats in the corridors
of power. This hostility was born of historical enmity, cultural
divergence, and above all ideological estrangement. [When geopolitical
rivalry]{.underline}, undergirded by the "natural laws" of realism, [is
added to this volatile mix]{.underline}, [conflict between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China may appear to be
dauntingly overdetermined]{.underline}.

[The shadows of]{.underline} mistakes made a hundred years ago before
[World War I]{.underline} should [inform our]{.underline} sober
[deliberations]{.underline} today. Responsible scholars, strategists,
and [policymakers]{.underline} on both sides of the Pacific [must
endeavor to reduce US-China tensions]{.underline}, [lest this
relationship repeat the tragedy of great power politics]{.underline},
[with **devastating consequences**]{.underline}. This book is part of
such an effort, and thus it seeks to chart a viable path of partnership
through the implementation of "cooperation spirals" that will provide
concrete policy benefits to both sides and to the world community more
generally, and thus provide the substantive framework for "new great
power relations," a term that should be embraced and not rejected by
Washington as explained in chapter 1. [The]{.underline} gradual and
[**reciprocal nature** of]{.underline} the [cooperation spirals suggests
that the]{.underline} process itself, or "[model]{.underline},"
[is]{.underline} so self-evident and [intuitive]{.underline} as part of
basic human interaction that it does not require extensive theoretical
elaboration. But the impulse toward compromise or mutual accommodation
that the cooperation spirals embody is informed by Kissinger's wise
observation that neither China nor the United States is any longer
sufficiently strong to impose solutions upon the other. Yet neither
superpower is well practiced in the difficult process of negotiating
compromises with an equal. 1

The essence of the argument made in this book is that [China
must]{.underline} make a comprehensive effort to increase the
transparency of its national security apparatus, [**reform some of its
long-held claim**s]{.underline}, and influence certain partners to
conform to international norms. In a series of deescalatory steps, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should **reciprocate by
limiting the scope of its military deployments**]{.underline} and
military engagement activities, particularly but not only in the
Asia-Pacific region. Together with its still-extant military
superiority, a thorough acquaintance with the deeper history of US-China
relations (chapter 2) should enable and inspire Washington to lead in
initiating a series of cooperation cycles. After all, it was American
ships that patrolled the Yangtze River for nearly a century after 1854
and not Chinese ships patrolling the Mississippi River. The
transformative nature of Taiwan-- Mainland interactions since 2008
(chapter 3) provides an extraordinary opportunity to demonstrate the
promise of the cooperation cycle and break this Gordian knot that has
long impeded enhanced US-China cooperation. Economic relations (chapter
4) provide vital ballast for the relationship and have yielded
remarkable benefits to both societies, while environmental cooperation
(chapter 5) is now extremely promising and will likely take center stage
in future relations as the world community grapples with the impending
challenge of climate change. A proposal is made suggesting that
Washington accept a per capita emissions standard if China will agree to
join a climate change treaty with intrusive verification procedures. In
the developing world (chapter 6), it is suggested that if Beijing were
more transparent in its aid, financial, and arms trade transactions,
Washington would likely agree to embrace China's coleadership--- for
example, in leading key institutions such as the World Bank.

To rectify American security policy toward China, [the United States
needs]{.underline} [to return to its traditional policy goal of
preventing any foreign power]{.underline} 9781441147899_txt_print.indd 7
26/09/2012 14:17 Introduction 7 [from exercising regional dominance in
the Asia Pacific. This policy serve]{.underline}d [America well for over
a century and underpinned broad]{.underline} U.S. [resistance
to]{.underline} Japanese [aggression]{.underline} across the Pacific
during World War II. The U.S. has never sought undisputed geopolitical
primacy (or "[hegemony]{.underline}" as some call it) in Asia; this
position [was thrust upon the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[by the]{.underline} surrender of Japan and the [ensuing power vacuum in
the region. Looking to the]{.underline} [future, the U.S. needs to
embrace the view that while it will not allow Chin]{.underline}a [to
assert dominance in Asia]{.underline}, neither does America seek to
maintain its own dominance in the region as a security objective either.
[Adopting this view]{.underline} [will allow the United States to best
realize peace and stability in East Asi]{.underline}a for the indefinite
future. Regarding economic relations with China, the U.S. would be much
better off explicitly taking the position that eliminating remaining
trade barriers would unleash far greater trade and investment between
the two countries, a result that would be in the best interests of the
United States. Participating robustly in China's economic development,
exporting extensively to the Chinese market, investing in China's
manufacturing sector and infrastructure, and encouraging Chinese
investment in the United States will significantly increase American
prosperity. Protectionist sentiments should not be allowed to heavily
influence U.S. economic policy toward China. The U.S. should instead
encourage extensive American investment in China as well as billions of
dollars of direct foreign investment in the United States by Chinese
companies. Doing so will create a large number of American jobs, reduce
production costs for U.S. companies and prices for American consumers,
and spur the development of innovative products. The best way for the
United States to encourage greater democracy and human rights practices
in China is to improve U.S.-China relations by resolving outstanding
security issues, and in so doing protect Taiwan's democratic system for
the long term. Friendly relations will sharply undercut the ability of
China's Communist Party to justify internal repression on security
grounds. The Party would lose what former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky calls "its most dependable weapon in the struggle for
unassailable domination---an external threat . . . that can unify the
people and justify draconian security measures at home." 5 With the
"U.S. threat" gone, the regime would no longer be able to argue that
internal dissent weakens China's ability to confront an attack by the
United States. And in the absence of ongoing tension with the U.S. on
security issues, Chinese people seeking democracy and human rights could

new paradigm for u.s.-China relations [Achieving the major security,
economic and political benefits of improve]{.underline}d U.S.-China
[relations is not a small task. It will require a fundamental
shift]{.underline} [in U.S. policy and]{.underline} an effort by [both
countries to build the foundation for a "stable peace" by establishing a
new paradigm for their relations]{.underline}. A [stable
peace]{.underline} between the United States and China [would be
characterized]{.underline} [by coexistence and greater
cooperation]{.underline}. [It can be realized by pursuing]{.underline}
[rapprochement]{.underline} with China [through a process of
**reciprocal restraint**]{.underline}, [where]{.underline} [each country
practices accommodation and expects reciprocal actions]{.underline} in
return. The principles and goals to guide this process are best embodied
in [a Framework Agreement]{.underline} which [would create a new
diplomatic architecture]{.underline} [between the two countries,
strengthening stability and enhancing prosperit]{.underline}y [in the
Asia Pacific for generations]{.underline} to come. [As the dominant
country in the Asia Pacific, the United States]{.underline} now faces a
crucial strategic choice: it [can use its superior diplomatic,
economic]{.underline} [and political power to seek a stable peace with
China by achieving]{.underline} a [new paradigm for]{.underline}
U.S.-China [relations. Or]{.underline}, on the contrary, the U.S. can
[narrowly focus on]{.underline} protecting its domestic markets from
Chinese business and [building up its military presence in East Asia in
the expectation of an inevitable armed conflict with China.]{.underline}
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger clearly sums up the risks of
future conflict between the U.S. and China in his 2011 history and
memoir, On China. Kissinger writes: [I am aware of the realistic
obstacles to the cooperative]{.underline} U.S.-China [relationship I
consider essential to global stability]{.underline} and peace. [A cold
war]{.underline} [between the two countries]{.underline} would arrest
progress for a generation on both sides of the Pacific. It [would spread
disputes into internal politics]{.underline} [of every region at a time
when]{.underline} global issues such as [nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}, [the environment, energy security, and
climate change impose]{.underline} g[lobal]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline}.6 To China hawks and protectionists who tend
to approach the future fearfully, a U.S. policy toward China of the kind
proposed here---based on reciprocal restraint and enlightened
self-interest---may seem objectionable. But [a policy which relies on
American power to facilitate a long-lasting framework for peaceful and
prosperous relations with China would]{.underline} best
[advance]{.underline} the [interests]{.underline} of the great majority
of Americans, now and in the future. 9781441147899_txt_print.indd 240
26/09/2012 14:17 Epilogue To fully appreciate the importance to the
United States of good relations with China, it is worth recalling the
wise words spoken by American presidents and senior foreign policy
officials during the last 40 years. President richard m. nixon February
1972 The Chinese people are a great people, the American people are a
great people. If our two peoples are enemies, the future of this world
we share together is dark indeed. But if we can find common ground to
work together, the chance for world peace is immeasurably increased . .
. . So let us . . . start a long march together, not in lockstep, but on
different roads leading to the same goal, the goal of building a world
structure of peace and justice in which all may stand together with
equal dignity and in which each nation, large or small, has a right to
determine its own form of government, free of outside interference or
domination. The world watches. The world listens. The world waits to see
what we will do . . . . There is no reason for us to be enemies. Neither
of us seeks the territory of the other; neither of us seeks domination
over the other; neither of us seeks to stretch out our hands and rule
the world.1 President Jimmy Carter December 1978 The United States of
America and the People's Republic of China have agreed to recognize each
other and to establish diplomatic relations as of January 1, 1979 . . .
. As a nation of gifted people who comprise about

one-fourth of the total population of the Earth, China plays, already,
an important role in world affairs, a role that can only grow more
important in the years ahead . . . . The change that I'm announcing
tonight will be of great long-term benefit to the peoples of both our
country and China--- and, I believe, to all the peoples of the world.
Normalization---and the expanded commercial and cultural relations that
it will bring---will contribute to the well-being of our own Nation, to
our own national interest, and it will also enhance the stability of
Asia . . . . These events are the final result of long and serious
negotiations begun by President Nixon in 1972, and continued under the
leadership of President Ford. The results bear witness to the steady,
determined, bipartisan effort of our country to build a world in which
peace will be the goal and the responsibility of all nations.2 President
ronald reagan April 1984 We have begun to write a new chapter for peace
and progress in our histories with America and China going forward hand
in hand . . . . We must always be realistic about our relationship,
frankly acknowledging the fundamental differences in ideology and
institutions between our two societies. Yes, let us acknowledge those
differences. Let us never minimize them. But let us not be dominated by
them. I have not come to China to hold forth on what divides us, but to
build on what binds us. I have not come to dwell on a closed-door past,
but to urge that Americans and Chinese look to the future, because
together we can and will make tomorrow a better day . . . . We can work
together as equals in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefit . .
. . America and China are both great nations. And we have a special
responsibility to preserve world peace.3 President William j. Clinton
June 1998 Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain
China because of its undemocratic system and human rights violations,
and in order to retard its capacity to become America's next great enemy

Seeking to isolate China is clearly unworkable . . . . \[[Choosing\]
isolation]{.underline} [over engagement would not make the world safer.
It would make it]{.underline} m[ore]{.underline} [dangerous. It would
undermine]{.underline} rather than strengthen our efforts to foster
[stability in Asia. It would eliminate]{.underline}, not facilitate
[cooperation on]{.underline} issues relating to [weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}. It would [hinder]{.underline}, not help the
cause of [democracy and human rights in China]{.underline}. It would
[set back]{.underline}, not step up [worldwide efforts to protect the
environment]{.underline}. It would [cut off]{.underline}, not open up
one of [the world's most important markets]{.underline}. It would
[encourage the Chinese]{.underline} [to turn inward and to act in
opposition to our interests]{.underline} and values. 4 Former national
security advisor Samuel R. Berger January 2001 \[A\] principle that
guides our foreign policy in a global age is that peace
[and]{.underline} security for America depends on building [principled,
constructive]{.underline} relations with our former great power
adversaries, Russia and China . . . . With China, our challenge has been
to steer between the extremes of uncritical engagement and untenable
confrontation. That balance has helped [maintain peace in the Taiwan
Straits, secured China's help]{.underline} in maintaining stability [on
the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}, and allowed us to negotiate an
historic agreement to bring it into the World Trade Organization. \[The
WTO Agreement\] . . . represents the most constructive breakthrough in
U.S.-China relations since normalization in 1979. For China, it is a
declaration of interdependence, and a commitment to start dismantling
the command and control economy through which the Communist Party
exercises much of its power. 5 Former national security advisor Brent
Scowcroft September 2006 \[W\]e've had seven presidents reaffirm the
general direction of our relations with China, but they didn't all start
out that way . . . . \[Tiananmen Square\] was a serious crisis in the
relationship. We had to 9781441147899_txt_print.indd 243 26/09/2012
14:17 Epilogue 243 respond. It was an outrageous act . . . . President
\[George H. W.\] Bush felt he had to respond but he did not want to
sever this relationship which had been gradually built up and gradually
deepened . . . . \[T\]here have been some really, really rough spots in
this relationship. But I think the fact that it has endured shows that
it is deeply important both to the United States and China, and it will
not survive any blows that either side can strike at it but it's strong
enough to endure most of them. So I'm proudly optimistic for the
future.6 Former secretary of state james baker March 2011 Allow me to be
blunt. Some in the United States---not a majority by any means, but
certainly a vocal minority---see China's rise as a threat somehow to
America's international status. They believe that conflict between our
two countries is inevitable as Chinese ambitions clash with American
position and power. Ladies and gentlemen, these observers are wrong. And
they are not only wrong, they are dangerously wrong. And the reason is
very simple---their analyses grossly underestimate the broad areas where
Chinese and American interests converge.7 Former secretary of the
Treasury Henry Paulson, jr. April 2011 There's no doubt in my mind that
. . . the more cross border investment we have, the more US investment
in China and the more Chinese investment in US, the stronger the
relations will be between the two countries . . . . And as I look at
fundamental problems \[the United States is\] dealing with, whether they
are the economic problem globally, whether they're national security,
whether the environment, \[I believe\] that these issues will be easier
to solve if you get the biggest developed nation and the biggest
developing nation working well together and with others, and \[those
problems will\] be impossible to solve if we don't work

. . . . \[W\]hat we're going to find is that a prosperous growing Asia
is going to be very good for the US, and a prosperous US is going to be
good for Asia . . . . \[T\]he more engagement you have, the more
investment you have . . . \[and\] then when the inevitable difficulties
take place, or \[political conflicts occur\], in Washington or Beijing,
it would be easier to bridge those, the more ties we have between our
two countries.8 Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger May 2011 In
his essay 'Perpetual Peace,' the philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that
perpetual peace would eventually come to the world in one of two ways:
by human insight or by conflicts and catastrophes of a magnitude that
left humanity no other choice. We are at such a juncture. When Premier
Zhou Enlai and I agreed on the communiqué that announced the secret
visit, he said: "This will shake the world." What a culmination if,
forty years later, the United States and China could merge their efforts
not to shake the world, but to build it.9 Former national security
advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski January 2012 [The]{.underline} United
States' [central challenge]{.underline} over the next several decades
[is to]{.underline} revitalize itself, while promoting a larger West and
buttressing a complex balance in the East that can
[accommodate]{.underline} China's rising global status . . . . [If the
United States and China can accommodate each other on a]{.underline}
[broad range of issues, the prospects for stability]{.underline} [in
Asia]{.underline} [will be greatly]{.underline} [increased]{.underline}
. . . . \[The\] United States must recognize that
[stability]{.underline} in Asia [can no longer be imposed by a non-Asian
power, least of all by]{.underline} the [direct]{.underline} application
of U.S. [military power]{.underline}. Indeed, [U.S. efforts]{.underline}
to buttress Asian stability [could prove self-defeating,
propelling]{.underline} Washington into a [costly]{.underline} repeat of
its recent [wars]{.underline}, potentially even resulting [in a replay
of]{.underline} the tragic events of [Europe in the twentieth
century]{.underline}.10

Rivalry\', September 2015,
https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/reviews/80851/fredman-goldstein-meeting-china-halfway-how-defuse-emerging-us-china\]

In addressing economic relations, Goldstein points out that [economic
interdependence does not preclude conflict. America was Japan's leading
trade partner in the years before Pearl Harbor, and Europe enjoyed a
high degree of economic interdependence leading up to World War I.
Despite high levels of trade]{.underline}, economic [tensions between
Washington and Beijing have increased]{.underline} over the last decade.
[But]{.underline} success stories like Boeing Corporation's
extraordinary role in improving China's civil air safety record from the
1990s to the present, while also increasing its market share, have
demonstrated how [closer collaboration can yield win-win results on a
massive scale.]{.underline} Beginning with reciprocal steps to decrease
barriers to the purchase of US companies and encourage major investment
in the US economy, [Goldstein seeks to lay the groundwork for improved
economic relations]{.underline} [that will]{.underline} eventually lead
to Washington easing restrictions on high-technology transfers to China
and [see Beijing]{.underline} allow [free float]{.underline} for [the
Renminbi]{.underline}.

[When it comes to environmental issues]{.underline} and relations with
the developing world, [Goldstein sees many opportunities for closer
cooperation]{.underline}. Public opinion [in]{.underline} both countries
shows increasing awareness of the dangers of [global
warming]{.underline}. [The November 2014 bilateral climate accord
demonstrates that key Chinese and American policymakers recognize the
enormous stakes]{.underline}. [Goldstein's cooperation
spiral]{.underline} on the environment and climate change lays out ten
policy proposals [lead]{.underline}ing [toward mutual acceptance of a
**global climate change treaty**]{.underline}. Goldstein also addresses
environmental concerns when discussing the developing world and US-China
relations, but he is most keen on formulating policy proposals that can
prevent Cold War-style geopolitical competition in Africa and Latin
America. Chinese thinkers show little appetite for a militarized
approach to Africa, and Goldstein argues that Washington should shutter
the Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM).

In the Middle East, meanwhile, Goldstein believes that [closer
cooperation between the United States and China could facilitate
improved ties between Tehran and Washington]{.underline}. [The
cooperation spiral]{.underline} he outlines in this chapter is
particularly ambitious, with its final steps [call]{.underline}ing
[for]{.underline} the United States to pressure Israel into giving up
its nuclear weapons and [China to use its influence to pressure Iran
into recognizing Israel and initiating bilateral ties]{.underline}.
Goldstein concedes that this cooperation spiral has a low probability of
success. Yet [both China and the United States have an interest in
stabilizing the Middle East, and US ambitions to transform the region
with military power have met with repeated failure. China's
rise]{.underline} as a global power, Goldstein concludes, [could help to
rebalance the structure of power in the region. Acting in
concert]{.underline} with other great powers, especially [China, could
help the United States in building a more stable, just, and prosperous
Middle East.]{.underline}

Gao Hairan, Deputy Director and Assistant Professor, National Center for
Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC), focuses on
China-U.S. relations on climate change and South-South cooperation on
climate change, The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, March 17, 2014,
"How China and the United States Can Work Together to Tackle Global
Climate Change", http://www.fletcherforum.org/2014/03/17/hairan/

**[Climate change is one of the most severe]{.underline}** environmental
and socioeconomic **[challenges faced]{.underline}** by human beings
**[today.]{.underline}** [It is]{.underline} also a key issue of
sustainable development and **[closely related to
biodiversity]{.underline}**, **[poverty alleviation]{.underline}**, and
the transformation to a low-carbon development path. [As the world's
largest economies and emitters of greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline},
**[China and the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[must
work together]{.underline}** more **[cooperatively]{.underline}** and
with other countries **[to combat climate change and to help the globe
build a low-carbon future.]{.underline}**

[Anthropogenic GHGs emissions have had a huge impact on global warming
since the Industrial Revolution.]{.underline} As such, **[curbing global
climate change requires]{.underline}** coordinated and **[coherent
global action]{.underline}**, as well as an overarching system that
includes all major greenhouse gas emitters (GHGs) in the world. The
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its
Kyoto Protocol have been the cornerstone of international cooperation on
tackling climate change since the 1990s.

[Still, major political differences remain between developed and
developing countries.]{.underline} Developed countries believe that the
current international climate framework should evolve over time and be
dynamic enough to reflect economic and geopolitical changes. Developing
countries, on the other hand, insist that developed countries should
continue to take the lead in GHGs emission reduction beyond 2020, and
developing countries should make efforts to cut their GHGs emissions
according to their capabilities. Furthermore, from the developing
countries' perspective, abandoning the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol and
redefining the principle of common but different responsibilities (CBDR)
is not acceptable.

[The current international]{.underline} political [dilemma]{.underline}
on combating climate change [is twofold: first, how should we allocate
valuable and limited GHGs emission space to various
countries?]{.underline} And [second, is this burden-sharing best
accomplished through a top-down or a bottom-up approach?]{.underline}
The former might accomplish this through an international,
legally-binding agreement such as the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, and
the latter through nationally determined, voluntary actions that may be
related but not limited to countries' QELROs, renewable energy
development targets, poverty alleviation, and energy intensity.

[Therefore, finding a common denominator is crucial to mobilizing global
consensus and action to curb climate change.]{.underline} As
negotiations continue, one possibility in 2015 would be a general
agreement that combines both the top-down and bottom-up approaches. This
could be facilitated through a robust international measurable,
reportable, and verifiable (MRV) system with common accounting rules to
ensure transparency and real emissions reductions by countries involved
without undermining their long-term socioeconomic development or
infringing upon national sovereignty. In addition, enhancing financial,
technological, and capacity building support will also be key elements
of any agreement, as they are of significant importance to help
developing countries address climate change.

**[As the two top GHGs emitters, economies, and energy users in the
world, the actions taken by China and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[are crucial to the realization of the
ultimate objective of the UNFCCC and sustainable development on a global
scale.]{.underline}** [In 2013, the total fossil CO2 emissions of China
and the United States accounted for]{.underline} **[more than forty
percent of world fossil CO2 emissions.]{.underline}** Therefore, **[any
successful effort to tackle climate change will need these two countries
to work towards a solution]{.underline}** either through the UNFCCC
process or on a bilateral basis. Meanwhile, it also must be noted that
China is different from the United States in various aspects, and should
thus bear different responsibilities in tackling climate change.
Recognizing the differences between the two countries politically will
be helpful for effectively managing those differences, building a
constructive partnership, and finding mutually acceptable approaches to
cooperation without undermining their respective core national
climate-related interests.

[Cooperation]{.underline} between China and the United States under the
UNFCCC [could ensure a successful 2015 global pact on climate change and
further solidify bilateral cooperation]{.underline} under the current
China-U.S. Climate Change Working Group (CCWG). As for the UNFCCC
process, both countries should demonstrate their political willingness
and commitment to it for the protection of climate as a global public
good. In terms of bilateral cooperation, issues of common interest may
include short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), shale gas, HFCs, nuclear
technology, and the five thematic areas under the CCWG. The two
countries must recognize that combating climate change, either through a
UN-led multilateral process or on a bilateral basis, is of mutual
interest to them, both economically and strategically.

By working together, China and the United States may also find new
domestic opportunities, such as economic restructuring and rebalancing
investment, finance, and trade between them. This could also help ensure
energy security and economic prosperity while moving towards a
low-carbon development path. [China-U.S. cooperation on climate may also
contribute to building new models of major power relations between them
and mobilizing global political momentum.]{.underline} In this
connection, regular, open, and targeted exchange, dialogue and
negotiation mechanisms on climate and energy should be further explored
and utilized to improve mutual understanding.

At its most basic, a grand bargain between two states may be understood
in a contractual fashion: it consists of a bundle of agreements by which
state X gives up something of significant strategic value to itself in
exchange for state Y committing to something that is of equal or greater
strategic value. The overall purpose would be to bring about more
clarity and predictability vis-à-vis their goals and interactions. 4

compared to power transition, see Evelyn Goh, 'The US--China
relationship and Asia-Pacific security: Negotiating change', Asian
Security, 1, no. 3, 2005, pp. 216--44. New Directions in Strategic
Thinking 2.0 54 [A 'grand bargain' is based on the notion that
coexistence among states]{.underline} (and especially major powers) [is
built upon reciprocal commitments, or fundamental political compromises,
which allow some form of strategic exchange and interdependence to
develop. Between great powers, grand bargains in their most advanced
form must entail some form of negotiated constraints to their exercise
of power]{.underline}. Grand bargains basically involve implicit or
explicit agreement about the mutually acceptable terms on which peaceful
relations can be conducted. These include understandings about
recognition and status, mutual rights and responsibilities, mutual
spheres of influence, terms of exchange and conditions of restraint. [It
is on this basis that scholars sometimes argue that the United States
and China, or China and Japan, will need to negotiate a grand bargain
between themselves and even with other key states in East Asia for
regional security and stability to prevail]{.underline}.6 In general,
the big advantage of a 'bargain' approach to understanding and
influencing great power relations is its innate relationality: [the
reciprocal and transactional assumptions underpinning bargains obliges
us to examine and try to reconcile the preferences, goals and tactics of
each of the parties involved. This sits in contrast to the one-sided
notions of containment or appeasement that often seem to dominate
debates about how to respond to China's rise]{.underline}, for example.
Thinking about bargains involves taking seriously what the other side
wants and values. [Moreover, a grand bargain approach helps us to grasp
the complexity of international orders. On the one hand, it connotes
linkage across issue areas]{.underline} (as Glaser suggests). [But it
also crucially entails a systemic perspective beyond bilateral
relationships]{.underline}; for instance, a grand bargain lens should
additionally allow us to probe the broader regional and historical
contexts that clearly affect the attractiveness, viability and scope of
any putative new US--China bargain. 6 See Evelyn Goh, 'Japan, China, and
the Great Power bargain in East Asia', East Asia Institute Fellows
Working Paper Series no. 32, November 2011, www.eai.or.kr/data/bbs/eng\_
report/2011103118375220.pdf (retrieved 29 January 2018). The key related

Hierarchy and Transition in Post--Cold War East Asia, Oxford University
Press, Oxford, 2013. 55 5. [The prospects for a Great Power 'grand
bargain' in East Asia From such a starting point, we may identify at
least two issues critical to the possibility of a grand bargain in
contemporary East Asia: the effects of existing strategic bargains, and
Chinese notions of the acceptable terms for a bargain with the United
States. Both these issues affect how desirable proposals for grand
bargains like White's and Glaser's might be from the points of view of
China and crucial US allies in the region. Strategic bargains in the
status quo ante Strategic bargains form the sinews of international
order, and while they are most likely to be struck at critical junctures
such as following crises or wars, once struck they do not simply
disappear but continue to evolve and might be renegotiated. As such,
anything we may propose in the contemporary setting would in fact be a
new grand bargain between the United States and China. It would not be
created from scratch, because the status quo ante is already marked by a
series of 'grand', regional, trilateral and bilateral bargains. This is
a fundamentally important point---**it shows that Washington and
Beijing** (and other East Asian states, for that matter) **have been and
are capable of striking bargains**]{.underline}.

independence movement. At the Shangri-la dialogue defense summit

Lieutenant General Shao Yuanming said Washington's support for Taipei
has sent "[terribly wrong signals to Taiwan's independence forces, which

#### No commitment problem -- but even if there is, the grand bargain itself solves any drawbacks

between Military Competition and Accommodation" *International

[One could argue that a grand bargain is of little or no value because
China faces a commitment problem]{.underline}. According to this
argument, as China becomes more powerful, the costs of reneging on the
deal will decrease, making defection China's best option; recognizing
this danger in advance, the United States should be unwilling to enter
into a grand bargain. [More specifically, this argument holds that China
will eventually be much better able to reassert its claims in the South
China and East China Seas, and to pressure U.S. allies to cut their ties
to the United States]{.underline}, and therefore will pursue these more
aggressive policies; consequently, a grand bargain is no better for the
United States than are unilateral concessions. [This argument overstates
the commitment problem.]{.underline} Whether China faces a commitment
problem depends on its aims: [if China's aims are limited and would be
largely satisfied by U.S. accommodation, then China does not face a
commitment problem]{.underline}; increases in China's power would not
make breaking the agreement its best option. [The barrier from the U.S.
perspective is that China's aims are uncertain. Given this information
problem, the United States would find itself uncertain about whether
China faces a commitment problem.]{.underline} The more the United
States believes it likely that China's aims go well beyond the terms of
the grand bargain, the less attractive the grand bargain is as a
long-term policy designed to respond to China's growing power. If a
grand bargain brought only risks and China was likely to break out of
the bargain, then the United States should not pursue it. As I have
shown, however, [a grand bargain could bring a variety of benefits,
including providing information about China's aims, which would reduce
the likelihood of a commitment problem; communicating U.S. resolve to
protect American interests; and possibly contributing to a Chinese
domestic consensus on limited aims]{.underline}. In addition, as
explained above, [the United States should pursue policies that would
contribute to preserving the grand bargain and reducing the costs if it
fails, including maintaining military capabilities sufficient to protect
its allies, which should help convince China that breaking the agreement
would harm its interests. Because neither the ability of the United
States to protect its allies nor its credibility for doing so would be
significantly diminished by the grand bargain or its unraveling, and
because China's goals could well be sufficiently limited that the United
States does not actually face a commitment problem, the grand bargain
has good prospects for increasing U.S. security.]{.underline}

these disputes are also weaker than its claims to Taiwan: for example,
China did not claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands until 1970, which
suggests that it should be able to moderate this claim if the benefits
were sufficiently large. In addition, an agreement would provide the
United States with insights into the balance of power within China's
foreign policy decisionmaking. [If China's more assertive policies have

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 63)

Beijing's move 2 on Taiwan: [China should remove its short-range
ballistic and cruise missiles from within a radius of 1,000 kilometers
from Taiwan]{.underline}. Mainland China's short-range missile forces
are often cited as the most severe threat that the PLA wields against
Taiwan. Indeed, such missiles were tested during the 1996 crisis, and
their numbers have grown considerably since then. **[Like the sword of
Damocles]{.underline}**, [these weapons threaten not only]{.underline}
"[shock and awe]{.underline}" [but also the possibility of knocking out
Taiwan's air and naval forces in a devastating first
strike]{.underline}, not to mention the very real possibility of
decapitating Taiwan's military and/ or civilian leadership. Antimissile
defenses such as the Patriot are very far from adequate to the threat,
because those systems could quite easily be overwhelmed by the sheer
weight of large missile salvoes. Moreover, PLA cruise missiles are now
ranging around Taiwan in ever-increasing numbers and, though easier to
shoot down, the cumulative threat of greater numbers of weapons will
naturally be much higher. Confronting this very "clear and present
danger," [the citizens of Taiwan have naturally become
unnerved]{.underline}. [And this reaction has generally resulted in
**closer defense relations between Washington and
Taipei**]{.underline}--- quite [contrary to Beijing's
goals]{.underline}. Thus, [the Mainland will find it politically useful
to actually lay this potent capability aside]{.underline} for the time
being. [This is not]{.underline}--- at least at this early stage--- [a
pledge not to use force]{.underline}. Rather, [this is largely a
symbolic move]{.underline} (because the weapons could quickly be
redeployed closer to Taiwan) [for political effect]{.underline}, [aimed
at showing goodwill and increasing confidence across the Strait
and]{.underline} also [between Washington and Beijing on this
crucial]{.underline}, [contentious issue]{.underline}. 55

Lyle J. Goldstein's Meeting China Halfway is essential reading for
anyone interested in US foreign relations or contemporary China. A
senior China scholar at the Naval War College, Goldstein warns that the
potential for US-China military conflict has increased markedly in the
past ten years. Influential academics like Aaron Friedberg (A Contest
for Supremacy: China, America, and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia
\[2011\]) and John Mearsheimer (The Tragedy of Great Power Politics
\[2014\]) have urged US policymakers to abandon engagement and focus on
containment. The Barack Obama administration, Goldstein notes, has
largely endorsed the program advocated by those seeking to balance
China's rise. In China, meanwhile, discourse regarding the United States
has become more bellicose. Many high-ranking officials in China's
security and defense establishments see the United States as China's
greatest national security threat. [If the downward spiral
in]{.underline} US-China [relations]{.underline}
[continues]{.underline}, Goldstein argues, [the result will]{.underline}
likely [be a "repetition of the]{.underline} misery caused by the
[catastrophic wars]{.underline} and wasteful rivalries [of the twentieth
century]{.underline}" (p. 325). Drawing from a wide array of Chinese and
American sources, [Goldstein lays out a plan to enable the two powers to
step back from rivalry and move toward mutual
accommodation]{.underline}. From its position of strength, Washington
must take the lead and begin accommodating China's interests in Asia.
For America, Goldstein concludes, "[there is no viable alternative to
meeting China halfway]{.underline}" (p. 364).

Goldstein makes his case by taking Chinese voices seriously and
proposing ten "**[cooperation spirals]{.underline}**" that outline
step-by-step approaches for [resolv]{.underline}ing [the seemingly
intractable problems in US-China relations. Cooperation spirals build
trust and confidence over time through **incremental and reciprocal
steps**]{.underline} [that **gradually lead to** larger and more
significant compromises]{.underline}. In each chapter, Goldstein
explores a particular issue by examining its historical background,
analyzing numerous Chinese and American perspectives, and then laying
out a cooperation spiral composed of ten concrete policy
proposals---five for the United States and five for China. Goldstein's
analysis of Chinese scholarship reveals a wide range of opinion, even on
controversial issues like Taiwan. In a field where many writers are
quick to dismiss Chinese viewpoints as propaganda---if they bother to
examine them at all---Meeting China Halfway stands out as a model of
rigorous, even-handed scholarship.

[Chin]{.underline}a hawks and believers in American exceptionalism will
find many of Goldstein's ideas hard to swallow, but they would be wise
to read his book carefully. Far too much writing on China rests on
ideologically tinged assumptions that Beijing must institute
American-style political and economic reforms in order to stave off
social unrest or collapse. Goldstein has little sympathy for such views,
which reveal more about American anxieties than they do about China.
Confidence that [China will become much stronger over the coming
decades]{.underline}, and that its economy will soon surpass that of the
United States in size, undergirds his basic arguments. He also points
out that China has already moved ahead of the US military in certain
domains, such as anti-ship cruise missiles. [Yet just
because]{.underline} Goldstein believes [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [cannot hope to impose its will on China does not
mean]{.underline} he advocates [making concessions without asking
Beijing to adjust its current and long-held positions in
return]{.underline}. [Rather, Goldstein urges Washington to
demonstrate]{.underline} real [leadership]{.underline} and courage [in
making the first moves]{.underline}. The fact is, as he shows, [China's
perspective has been influenced by their view of a "century of
humiliation.]{.underline}" While the United States did not take the lead
in much of the Western imperialism that undermined Chinese sovereignty
in the century leading up to World War II, it still played a large role.
[Imagine if the Chinese Navy had patrolled the Mississippi River with
gunboats from the 1850s to the 1940s, as the US Navy did on China's
Yangtze River, and you can begin to understand why it is imperative that
Washington acts first]{.underline}.

[The Taiwan problem has long been a key irritant in US-China relations.
Goldstein's cooperation spiral]{.underline} for this issue rests on the
assumption that the United States cannot indefinitely maintain close
security ties with a claimed island off the coast of a nuclear-armed
superpower. He [urges Washington to create circumstances that
**promote**]{.underline} the [**settlement** of the Taiwan problem
rather than its perpetuation]{.underline}. Taiwan-Mainland
[integration]{.underline}, Goldstein argues, [will actually **strengthen
US alliances** with Japan and South Korea by preventing these countries
from being pulled by treaty commitments into a conflict over Taiwan.
Goldstein seeks a permanent solution by **beginning with smaller
moves**:]{.underline} **[reducing US forces]{.underline}** on Guam and
closing the military office at the American Institute in Taipei [while
Beijing instigates]{.underline} military [exchanges with Taiwan without
preconditions and **pulls missiles back**]{.underline} from East China.
[The cooperation spiral **culminates** with Washington halting weapons
sales to Taiwan, and Beijing renouncing the use of force and beginning a
peace treaty process that joins Taiwan and the Mainland in a
confederation]{.underline}. Goldstein concludes that [a breakthrough
on]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline} problem [is "**imperative to
U.S.-China cooperation** in the twenty-first century"]{.underline} (p.
72).

In addressing economic relations, Goldstein points out that economic
interdependence does not preclude conflict. America was Japan's leading
trade partner in the years before Pearl Harbor, and Europe enjoyed a
high degree of economic interdependence leading up to World War I.
Despite high levels of trade, economic tensions between Washington and
Beijing have increased over the last decade. But success stories like
Boeing Corporation's extraordinary role in improving China's civil air
safety record from the 1990s to the present, while also increasing its
market share, have demonstrated how closer collaboration can yield
win-win results on a massive scale. Beginning with reciprocal steps to
decrease barriers to the purchase of US companies and encourage major
investment in the US economy, Goldstein seeks to lay the groundwork for
improved economic relations that will eventually lead to Washington
easing restrictions on high-technology transfers to China and see
Beijing allow free float for the Renminbi.

When it comes to environmental issues and relations with the developing
world, Goldstein sees many opportunities for closer cooperation. Public
opinion in both countries shows increasing awareness of the dangers of
global warming. The November 2014 bilateral climate accord demonstrates
that key Chinese and American policymakers recognize the enormous
stakes. Goldstein's cooperation spiral on the environment and climate
change lays out ten policy proposals leading toward mutual acceptance of
a global climate change treaty. Goldstein also addresses environmental
concerns when discussing the developing world and US-China relations,
but he is most keen on formulating policy proposals that can prevent
Cold War-style geopolitical competition in Africa and Latin America.
Chinese thinkers show little appetite for a militarized approach to
Africa, and Goldstein argues that Washington should shutter the
Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM).

In the Middle East, meanwhile, Goldstein believes that closer
cooperation between the United States and China could facilitate
improved ties between Teheran and Washington. The cooperation spiral he
outlines in this chapter is particularly ambitious, with its final steps
calling for the United States to pressure Israel into giving up its
nuclear weapons and China to use its influence to pressure Iran into
recognizing Israel and initiating bilateral ties. Goldstein concedes
that this cooperation spiral has a low probability of success. Yet both
China and the United States have an interest in stabilizing the Middle
East, and US ambitions to transform the region with military power have
met with repeated failure. China's rise as a global power, Goldstein
concludes, could help to rebalance the structure of power in the region.
Acting in concert with other great powers, especially China, could help
the United States in building a more stable, just, and prosperous Middle
East.

On the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein makes the case for coequal Chinese
and American leadership in forging a durable peace. His analysis of
Chinese writing on Korea is enlightening. Chinese intellectuals see the
South Korean military and defense industries as models to emulate. They
do not view Seoul's evolving military posture as a threat. At the same
time, more and more Chinese analysts have called for a reevaluation of
Beijing's stance toward Pyongyang. Goldstein, however, actually
encourages Beijing to take steps that would enhance Pyongyang's
security, including a reinvigoration of the 1961 Sino-North Korean
Defense Treaty and a symbolic troop presence in North Korea. Given the
vast disparity of economic power and conventional military capabilities
on the peninsula, Pyongyang's anxieties are understandable. A token
Chinese military presence and stronger commitment to upholding security
and stability on the peninsula could preclude the need for North Korea
to take radical steps to demonstrate its will to fight. Further steps on
the cooperation spiral propose that Washington inaugurate diplomatic
relations with North Korea and withdraw a large number of troops from
South Korea while still maintaining its alliance with Seoul. China, for
its part, should oversee North Korea's complete and verified nuclear
disarmament. The most salient problem on the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein
concludes, is North Korea's stark vulnerability and insecurity. To
achieve disarmament, North Korea must first be made more secure, and
only "China has the means and incentive to aid in this endeavor" (p.
218).

Goldstein's approach to Japan is equally bold and creative. To a large
extent, he writes, the divisive issues between Tokyo and Beijing are
"imagined" (p. 226). Tokyo fears an immensely powerful and militaristic
China that could hypothetically threaten Japan's vital interests in the
future. Beijing's anxieties about a revival of Japanese militarism
ignore how cautiously and sparingly Japan has deployed its armed might
since 1945. Nevertheless, relations between China and Japan "have been
in a virtual death spiral since at least 2010, if not before" (p. 225).
China has legitimate historical grievances that Japan must address, and
Goldstein states that Washington must push Tokyo toward a "Willy Brandt"
solution involving reparations and a prime ministerial visit to the
Nanjing Massacre Museum. Other proposals in the cooperation spiral call
for a reduced US Marine Corps presence in Okinawa, joint administration
of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, and a median line settlement in the East
China Sea. Ultimately, Goldstein advocates a restructured US-Japan
alliance and Chinese endorsement of a permanent seat for Japan on the
United Nations Security Council.

Tensions in the South China Sea have recently overshadowed antagonistic
relations between Beijing and Tokyo, and Goldstein's chapter on the
topic is both timely and sobering. [Beijing's official stance and the
opinions expressed by leading Chinese academics have become more
hawkish. US-China rivalry in the region has also
intensified]{.underline} following Chinese construction and land
reclamation projects over the past year. Voices of moderation are now
rare on both sides of the Pacific. [Goldstein reminds readers, however,
that **Beijing made many compromises in the past** to settle its land
border disputes. The present situation is undoubtedly dangerous because
of misperceptions and disturbing action/reaction patterns, but it need
not inevitably become "the 'Fulda Gap']{.underline} of a new Cold War"
(p. 291). [Creating the conditions for a cooperation spiral will be
difficult, and Goldstein proposes **modest initial steps**]{.underline}.
To begin, the United States should invite China to play a major role at
the annual Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training exercises in
Thailand. Bangkok enjoys excellent relations with both Washington and
Beijing, and the exercises focus on nontraditional security issues like
counterterrorism, an issue the Chinese Navy explicitly embraces. China
should respond by proposing a regional antipiracy patrol in the Malacca
Strait area in cooperation with the US Navy. As the two countries build
up greater trust, China must clarify the precise nature of its claims in
the South China Sea and make those claims consistent with the Law of the
Sea. From there, the United States can begin supporting bilateral
negotiations between China and other claimants so that China can
operationalize a joint development program for the South China Sea
guided by a 50/50 split framework.

In sum, Goldstein argues that [China must adjust some of its long-held
claims]{.underline}, increase the transparency of its national security
apparatus, and press countries like North Korea and Iran to conform to
international norms. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [should **reciprocate** by **drawing back some
of its military deployments**]{.underline} and military engagement
activities, including trimming its force of aircraft carriers. [He
admits that hardly any of the compromises he suggests will be
easy]{.underline}. Leaders in both countries must show bravery and avoid
popular China-bashing and America-bashing. Washington needs to also
resist pressure from Asian allies to take a more forceful stance against
China. Exercising restraint and dealing with China as an equal will not
be easy, but as Goldstein concludes, there is no other way.

[Meeting China Halfway **never calls for unilateral concessions**, and
none of his policy proposals are **set in stone**. **Gradualism**,
**reciprocity**, and **mutual compromise** are the core
principles]{.underline} of his approach. As his painstaking research
demonstrates, a very substantial number of Chinese scholars and
strategists want to work constructively with the United States. However,
if US policymakers opt for containment rather than engagement, then
China's own hawks will carry the day in Beijing. [A new cold war will
undermine **regional stability** and decrease the chances for US-China
cooperation across the board]{.underline}. Goldstein concedes that
[Washington must **hedge against the worst-case scenario**]{.underline},
but to make this hedge the central thrust of US China policy would be a
colossal mistake.

#### Yes Taiwan compromise---Their ev doesn't assume rapprochement 

**Goldstein**, associate professor and founding director, China Maritime
Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May **2015**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 72)

Although Washington and Beijing have increasingly taken one another as
rivals in recent years, [Taiwan and the Mainland have been taking
concrete and frequently difficult steps toward peace]{.underline}. As
one Mainland visitor to Taiwan recently said: "I really want more
mainland people to come and see Taiwan, and then they will understand
\[that\] ... it's not like what they see on the TV.... This impression
will gradually let Mainland people, especially my generation, think:
'Oh, Taiwan is so good, why do we want to conquer them? It's not
necessary. We should learn from them.'" [This]{.underline} comment
[illustrates the strength of interdependence in action]{.underline}. 70
[Given unpredictable electoral politics in Taipei, some Western
commentators are already predicting Chinese "sabre-rattling" and a new
cross-Strait crisis just over the horizon, but **astute diplomacy** in
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei can help to mitigate the impact of these
foreseeable difficulties]{.underline}. 71 [History, geography, culture,
and economics are all compelling the cross-Strait rapprochement. Instead
of attempting to counter this trend, US strategy should **seize upon
this opportunity** to achieve the breakthrough that will be imperative
to US-China cooperation]{.underline} in the twenty-first century.

integration, Goldstein argues, will actually strengthen US alliances
with Japan and South Korea by preventing these countries from being
pulled by treaty commitments into a conflict over Taiwan. Goldstein
seeks a permanent solution by beginning with smaller moves: reducing US
forces on Guam and closing the military office at the American Institute
in Taipei while Beijing instigates military exchanges with Taiwan
without preconditions and pulls missiles back from East China. The
cooperation spiral culminates with Washington halting weapons sales to
Taiwan, and Beijing renouncing the use of force and beginning a peace
treaty process that joins Taiwan and the Mainland in a confederation.
Goldstein concludes that a breakthrough on the Taiwan problem is
"imperative to U.S.-China cooperation in the twenty-first century" (p.
72).

In addressing economic relations, Goldstein points out that economic
interdependence does not preclude conflict. America was Japan's leading
trade partner in the years before Pearl Harbor, and Europe enjoyed a
high degree of economic interdependence leading up to World War I.
Despite high levels of trade, economic tensions between Washington and
Beijing have increased over the last decade. But success stories like
Boeing Corporation's extraordinary role in improving China's civil air
safety record from the 1990s to the present, while also increasing its
market share, have demonstrated how closer collaboration can yield
win-win results on a massive scale. Beginning with reciprocal steps to
decrease barriers to the purchase of US companies and encourage major
investment in the US economy, Goldstein seeks to lay the groundwork for
improved economic relations that will eventually lead to Washington
easing restrictions on high-technology transfers to China and see
Beijing allow free float for the Renminbi.

When it comes to environmental issues and relations with the developing
world, Goldstein sees many opportunities for closer cooperation. [Public
opinion in both countries shows increasing awareness of the
dangers]{.underline} of global warming. The November 2014 bilateral
climate accord demonstrates that key Chinese and American policymakers
recognize the enormous stakes. Goldstein's cooperation spiral on the
environment and climate change lays out ten policy proposals leading
toward mutual acceptance of a global climate change treaty. Goldstein
also addresses environmental concerns when discussing the developing
world and US-China relations, but he is most keen on formulating policy
proposals that can prevent Cold War-style geopolitical competition in
Africa and Latin America. Chinese thinkers show little appetite for a
militarized approach to Africa, and Goldstein argues that Washington
should shutter the Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM).

In the Middle East, meanwhile, Goldstein believes that closer
cooperation between the United States and China could facilitate
improved ties between Teheran and Washington. The cooperation spiral he
outlines in this chapter is particularly ambitious, with its final steps
calling for the United States to pressure Israel into giving up its
nuclear weapons and China to use its influence to pressure Iran into
recognizing Israel and initiating bilateral ties. Goldstein concedes
that this cooperation spiral has a low probability of success. Yet both
China and the United States have an interest in stabilizing the Middle
East, and US ambitions to transform the region with military power have
met with repeated failure. China's rise as a global power, Goldstein
concludes, could help to rebalance the structure of power in the region.
Acting in concert with other great powers, especially China, could help
the United States in building a more stable, just, and prosperous Middle
East.

On the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein makes the case for coequal Chinese
and American leadership in forging a durable peace. His analysis of
Chinese writing on Korea is enlightening. Chinese intellectuals see the
South Korean military and defense industries as models to emulate. They
do not view Seoul's evolving military posture as a threat. At the same
time, more and more Chinese analysts have called for a reevaluation of
Beijing's stance toward Pyongyang. Goldstein, however, actually
encourages Beijing to take steps that would enhance Pyongyang's
security, including a reinvigoration of the 1961 Sino-North Korean
Defense Treaty and a symbolic troop presence in North Korea. Given the
vast disparity of economic power and conventional military capabilities
on the peninsula, Pyongyang's anxieties are understandable. A token
Chinese military presence and stronger commitment to upholding security
and stability on the peninsula could preclude the need for North Korea
to take radical steps to demonstrate its will to fight. Further steps on
the cooperation spiral propose that Washington inaugurate diplomatic
relations with North Korea and withdraw a large number of troops from
South Korea while still maintaining its alliance with Seoul. China, for
its part, should oversee North Korea's complete and verified nuclear
disarmament. The most salient problem on the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein
concludes, is North Korea's stark vulnerability and insecurity. To
achieve disarmament, North Korea must first be made more secure, and
only "China has the means and incentive to aid in this endeavor" (p.
218).

Goldstein's approach to Japan is equally bold and creative. To a large
extent, he writes, the divisive issues between Tokyo and Beijing are
"imagined" (p. 226). Tokyo fears an immensely powerful and militaristic
China that could hypothetically threaten Japan's vital interests in the
future. Beijing's anxieties about a revival of Japanese militarism
ignore how cautiously and sparingly Japan has deployed its armed might
since 1945. Nevertheless, relations between China and Japan "have been
in a virtual death spiral since at least 2010, if not before" (p. 225).
China has legitimate historical grievances that Japan must address, and
Goldstein states that Washington must push Tokyo toward a "Willy Brandt"
solution involving reparations and a prime ministerial visit to the
Nanjing Massacre Museum. Other proposals in the cooperation spiral call
for a reduced US Marine Corps presence in Okinawa, joint administration
of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, and a median line settlement in the East
China Sea. Ultimately, Goldstein advocates a restructured US-Japan
alliance and Chinese endorsement of a permanent seat for Japan on the
United Nations Security Council.

Tensions in the South China Sea have recently overshadowed antagonistic
relations between Beijing and Tokyo, and Goldstein's chapter on the
topic is both timely and sobering. [Beijing's official stance and the
opinions expressed by leading Chinese academics have become more
hawkish]{.underline}. US-China rivalry in the region has also
intensified following Chinese construction and land reclamation projects
over the past year. [Voices of moderation are now rare on both sides of
the Pacific]{.underline}. [Goldstein reminds readers, however, that
Beijing made many compromises in the past to settle its]{.underline}
land [border disputes. The present situation is undoubtedly dangerous
because of misperceptions and disturbing action/reaction patterns, but
it need not inevitably become "the 'Fulda Gap]{.underline}' of a new
Cold War" (p. 291). Creating the conditions for a cooperation spiral
will be difficult, and Goldstein proposes modest initial steps. To
begin, the United States should invite China to play a major role at the
annual Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training exercises in Thailand.
Bangkok enjoys excellent relations with both Washington and Beijing, and
the exercises focus on nontraditional security issues like
counterterrorism, an issue the Chinese Navy explicitly embraces. China
should respond by proposing a regional antipiracy patrol in the Malacca
Strait area in cooperation with the US Navy. As the two countries build
up greater trust, China must clarify the precise nature of its claims in
the South China Sea and make those claims consistent with the Law of the
Sea. From there, the United States can begin supporting bilateral
negotiations between China and other claimants so that China can
operationalize a joint development program for the South China Sea
guided by a 50/50 split framework.

In sum, Goldstein argues that China must adjust some of its long-held
claims, increase the transparency of its national security apparatus,
and press countries like North Korea and Iran to conform to
international norms. The United States should reciprocate by drawing
back some of its military deployments and military engagement
activities, including trimming its force of aircraft carriers. He admits
that hardly any of the compromises he suggests will be easy. Leaders in
both countries must show bravery and avoid popular China-bashing and
America-bashing. Washington needs to also resist pressure from Asian
allies to take a more forceful stance against China. Exercising
restraint and dealing with China as an equal will not be easy, but as
Goldstein concludes, there is no other way.

Meeting China Halfway never calls for unilateral concessions, and none
of his policy proposals are set in stone. Gradualism, reciprocity, and
mutual compromise are the core principles of his approach. [As his
**painstaking research demonstrates**]{.underline}, [a very substantial
number of Chinese scholars and strategists want to work constructively
with the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. However, [if
US policymakers opt for containment rather than engagement, then
**China\'s own hawks will carry the day** in Beijing]{.underline}. [A
new cold war will undermine regional stability and decrease the chances
for US-China cooperation across the board]{.underline}. Goldstein
concedes that Washington must hedge against the worst-case scenario, but
to make this hedge the central thrust of US China policy would be a
colossal mistake.

political transition offers Washington a window of opportunity to
improve relations with Beijing. Rather than risk a continuing downward
spiral]{.underline} [in the critical US-China relationship]{.underline},
President Barack [Obama must move quickly]{.underline} in his second
term [to take advantage of this]{.underline} opportunity. At last week's
18th Party Congress, Beijing began a **[once-in-a-decade leadership
transition]{.underline}**. The new leaders who will take office in March
-- including [President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang -- know first
hand some of the worst excesses of the]{.underline} Chinese Communist
Party ([CCP]{.underline}). [They were victims of Mao's Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution, when an entire generation of young people -- many
from prominent families -- were "sent down" to rural areas for years to
perform backbreaking manual labor. Having experienced and survived
widespread human rights abuses]{.underline} that occurred between 1966
and 1976, the year of Mao's death, [China's new leaders will be more
receptive to calls for]{.underline} political [reform from the country's
middle class and liberal intellectuals, who are highly critical
of]{.underline} increasing corruption and cronyism with [the
CCP]{.underline}. Pressure from the middle class is driving a push for
political reform at the same time that China's leaders are dealing with
daunting challenges arising from rapid economic development -- among
them glaring social inequality, inflation, frequent "mass incidents,"
social unrest, and environmental degradation. [China's new leaders will
welcome overtures from Washington along with any US policies that aim to
assist China in meeting the challenges it faces]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} harsh US trade measures or [increased military
pressure will likely be met with a tough response as the new leaders
seek to prove their mettle and their capability to defend China's
national interests]{.underline}. [Beijing's political transition comes
at a time when the United States stands at a crossroads in US-China
relations]{.underline}. We urgently need a national debate to rethink
our China policy and prevent doing permanent damage to US interests in
Asia. [Increased tensions with China could]{.underline} have dire
consequences. They could [lead to a military conflict over Taiwan's
political status, over]{.underline} whether Japan or China holds
sovereignty to a group of uninhabitable islands in [the
E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea,
[or]{.underline} over the ownership of small islands and energy
resources in [the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea. In a worst-case scenario, **[those conflicts could
escalate]{.underline}**, by accident or design, **[to]{.underline}** a
**[nuclear exchange]{.underline}**. It is essential to remember that
China's rise strengthens the US economy and its future prosperity. Trade
with China -- the third-largest US export market -- has aided America's
recovery during the global financial crisis. Between 2000 and 2011, US
exports to China increased by about 640 percent, going from \$16 billion
to \$104 billion. China is the largest growth market in the world for US
exports and supports thousands of high-quality jobs. [The best way to
overcome the "China threat" and advance US interests in the region is by
achieving a **stable peace** with China through the **resolution of
outstanding security**]{.underline} and economic
**[conflicts]{.underline}** between the two countries. This would enable
the US to deal decisively with the very legitimate concerns many
Americans have over China's commercial practices, including infringement
of intellectual property rights, undervalued currency, and protectionist
measures that favor domestic industries. [Through a new policy approach,
we can ensure China is a future partner and not a threat to US
interests]{.underline}. [This policy should]{.underline} embrace the
following objectives:  **[significantly reduce China's]{.underline}**
current and potential **[military threat to Taiwan]{.underline}**, thus
securing Taiwan's democracy;  achieve a pull-back of Chinese forces
from a defined coastal security zone surrounding Japan;  have China
submit its maritime disputes in the South and East China Seas to an
independent international judicial body;  increase security cooperation
with China on both regional and global issues;  substantially increase
China's military transparency, especially in the development of new
weapons systems;  facilitate new bilateral and regional free trade
agreements that will unleash unprecedented levels of international trade
and investment, generating hundreds of thousands of new US jobs; 
greatly strengthen the advocates of human rights and democracy in China
by depriving security forces of their "most dependable weapon," in the
view of former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky: an external security
threat from the United States which is now used to legitimize internal
political repression. PacNet 1003 Bishop Street, Suite 1150, Honolulu,

### \--Coop Spirals

#### The counterplan sparks a cooperation spiral, [leading to change in policy]{.underline} and [avoiding escalation]{.underline} -- but the perm fails -- [linkage]{.underline} and [reciprocity]{.underline} are key

**Goldstein**, associate professor and founding director, China Maritime
Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May **2015**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 12-14)

[In addition to]{.underline} the commonsense methodological approach of
[surveying a wide body of Chinese-language writings]{.underline}, [this
book also presents the]{.underline} [conceptual innovation
of]{.underline} "[cooperation spirals]{.underline}," in order [to
provide bilateral policy]{.underline} "[moves]{.underline}"
[for]{.underline} achieving [substantive progress in US-China
relations]{.underline} across a range of difficult issues. [A
cooperation spiral may be considered **the precise opposite of an
escalation spiral**]{.underline}--- which is frequently interpreted as
the result of fear and misperception when leaders confront security
dilemmas. 41 [In a cooperation spiral]{.underline}, [trust and
confidence are built]{.underline} over time **[through]{.underline}**
incremental and [**reciprocal steps** that]{.underline} gradually [lead
to larger and more significant compromises]{.underline}. To be sure,
these proposed steps will be difficult--- and thus their related
challenges are fully analyzed in the chapters that follow--- but
[their]{.underline} gradual, evolutionary, and [**reciprocal nature**
make them]{.underline} a [feasible]{.underline} guide for practitioners.

Unfortunately, the leading journals in East Asian international
relations, such as Asian Survey and International Security, appear to
neglect the issue of how to foster US-China cooperation. 42
Alternatively, academic journals that do take international cooperation
as their focus, such as Conflict Management and Peace Science, have
tended to disregard the issue of China, and US-China relations in
particular. A veritable intellectual chasm has therefore seemed to open
up with respect to fresh scholarship on how Beijing and Washington might
cooperate in the twenty-first century.

Nevertheless, a number of relevant insights from the quite extensive
theoretical debate--- which generally pits "neoliberals" against
"neorealists"--- regarding the nature of cooperation in world politics
are summarized here. Two pioneers in the study of international
cooperation, Robert Axelrod and Robert Keohane, warn at the outset that
"achieving cooperation is difficult in world politics, ... \[where\]
cheating and deception are endemic." They highlight the importance of
the "mutuality of interests," as expressed in "payoff structures," the
"shadow of the future," and the number of actors involved. Each of these
issues is pertinent to the prospects for US-China cooperation, given
that [one may evaluate whether Beijing and Washington indeed
prefer]{.underline} "[mutual cooperation]{.underline}" [to]{.underline}
"[mutual defection]{.underline}," because that cannot be assumed. They
emphasize, moreover, that the "mutuality of interests is not based
simply on objective factors, but is grounded upon the actors' perception
of their own interests. Perceptions define interests." [These scholars
evaluate]{.underline} both the possibilities and risks of [**"issue
linkage"** in facilitating cooperation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
also [the likely constraints posed by domestic politics]{.underline}.
[They]{.underline} appear to [**offer strong support** for the proposed
cooperation spiral model]{.underline}, [when they assert
that]{.underline} "**[a strategy based on reciprocity]{.underline}**---
[such as **tit for tat**]{.underline}--- [can be remarkably effective in
promoting cooperation]{.underline}, ... [even among pure
egoists]{.underline}." Still, even these foremost advocates of
cooperation are quite cognizant that attempts at reciprocity can devolve
into "acrimonious and frustrating patterns of bargaining," but also that
the most effective motive for cooperation between rivals in world
politics has generally been the "activities of a third power." 43
Cheating and the problem of relative gains also pose significant
challenges for policymakers that seek mutual accommodation by employing
cooperation spirals. Nevertheless, [Asia specialists are]{.underline}
still [very much intrigued by the possibilities for reinvigorated
engagement]{.underline}, as one scholar explained in the summer of 2013
in the leader article of Global Asia: "[Engagement invites
**reciprocity**]{.underline}, thus [setting in motion **a succession of
positive changes in policy**]{.underline} and outlook quite **[opposite
from the ladder of escalation]{.underline}** that characterizes all too
many international conflicts." 44

#### The counterplan [builds trust]{.underline}, [breaks deadlock]{.underline}, and [prevents great power war]{.underline} -- but [reciprocity]{.underline} is required

**Goldstein**, associate professor and founding director, China Maritime
Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May **2015**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 12-14)

[The cooperation spiral model]{.underline}, as applied in this book
across a wide variety of difficult policy dilemmas in US-China
relations, [draws on all major traditions in
**i**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
[theory]{.underline}. [From the constructivist tradition]{.underline},
the model relies on the conception that [ideas and norms have force unto
themselves]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore [creative
diplomacy]{.underline} and focused leadership [can]{.underline}
potentially [break **divisive deadlocks** and **prevent**]{.underline}
the tragedy of **[great power conflict]{.underline}**.
[From]{.underline} [the liberal tradition]{.underline}, the model adopts
certain precepts related to **[processes]{.underline}**, and
specifically to those institutions that [can guide expectations and
behavior]{.underline}--- thus **[building trust and
enabling]{.underline}** further **[cooperation]{.underline}**. Finally,
though in somewhat obvious contradiction to realist predictions of
rivalry, [the cooperation spiral]{.underline} also [takes certain
realist principles as essential]{.underline}, [including the principles
that cooperative measures must be consistent with state
interests]{.underline}, must accord with tendencies in the balance of
power, [and **must**]{.underline} also **[be reciprocal in
nature]{.underline}** to the extent possible. Therefore, the proposed
model also represents a realist form of cooperation. Stimulating a wider
discussion of alternative steps within the proposed cooperation spirals
would constitute, in itself, a major contribution to this field. After
all, this author hardly purports to be Moses with a Hundred
Commandments. [The twin **key points** of this approach are that
**reciprocity is necessary**]{.underline} and that practical first steps
must be found. The endpoints only seem utopian in the absence of the
accomplishments that result from climbing the earlier steps, and even if
the endpoints remain out of reach, each step represents a significant
advance. For instance, the European Union could not have emerged except
at the end of a path of cooperation that began with small and tentative
cooperative efforts that proved themselves intrinsically useful. 48

Keeps Improving Prized Relations With US, 2018,

[Two arms-related deals, a congressional bill]{.underline} [that calls
for more senior]{.underline}-level Taipe[i-Washington visits and a
string of comments from the United States in support of Taiwan's foreign
diplomacy this year have raised fears that Trump is using ties with
Taipei just to get concessions out of China]{.underline}. Two days after
Taiwan cut ties Aug. 21 with El Salvador, the U.S. State Department
expressed "grave concern" and warned the Central American country
against taking economic incentives from China. In another sign of closer
Taipei-Washington relations, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen made two
unusually visible stops in the United States earlier this month over
protests from Beijing. She gave a speech August 13 in Los Angeles. In
Houston she became the first Taiwan president since the 1970s to visit
federal property. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory,
not as a country, and resents major powers such as the United States for
interacting with it. China and Taiwan have been separately ruled since
the Chinese civil war of the 1940s. Move to check China Since Tsai took
office in 2016, Beijing has flown military aircraft near Taiwan at least
a dozen times and, officials in Taipei say, persuaded five countries to
drop Taiwan as an ally. Tsai rejects Beijing's condition for dialogue,
that both sides talk as parts of the same country. [The US doesn't seek
a stalemate in cross-Strait relations; it seeks positive improvement,
and would not oppose better relations, according to Bonnie Glaser,
director of the China Power Project at the American think tank Center
for International and Strategic Studies. Washington has long advocated
stability between China and Taiwan]{.underline} rather than one side
provoking the other. "[U.S. policy makers aren't seeking ways to use
Taiwan to increase leverage over China," Glaser said. "In response to
stepped up military, political and economic pressure by Beijing on
Taiwan, the Trump administration is signaling support for the
maintenance of the cross-Strait status quo and for Taiwan's
security]{.underline}." Stronger Asia-Pacific alliance [Trump may see
Taiwan as part of an Asia Pacific alliance that would resist China,
said]{.underline} [Lin Chong-pin, a retired strategic studies professor
in Taiwan.]{.underline} "He's also trying to unite the allies in the
East Asian Pacific region to form a united front against China and to
add pressure on China," Lin said. "Not only Japan, Australia and India,
but Taiwan is also one them along with South Korea in forming a united
front against China. That's the intention." [Washington stepped up
military cooperation last year]{.underline} with Australia, India and
Japan to keep the South China Sea open to international traffic. Beijing
claims about 90 percent of that waterway.

### AT: Bargain = Appeasement

#### China desires to unify with Taiwan for nationalistic and defensive purposes. It is impossible to determine whether China desires hegemony in the region, but US assistance projects to Japan and naval presence ensure that a unified China would not catalyze expansionism.

Fourth, [the United States and China may disagree about the future of
the U.S. military presence and alliances in Northeast Asia]{.underline}.
John Mearsheimer argues that once its power has increased sufficiently,
China will be determined to drive the United States from the region,
because achieving regional hegemony will increase its security. In a
similar vein, [Aaron Friedberg]{.underline} argues that although China's
long-term goals remain uncertain, "what [China's current rulers appear
to want and what their successors will almost certainly want as well, is
to see their country become the dominant or predominant power in East
Asia\... despite repeated claims to the contrary, it does seek a form of
regional hegemony.]{.underline}"36 Friedberg identifes multiple reasons
for this assessment, including China's national security; its historical
identity as the region's predominant power; the desire of the
authoritarian regime to retain power; and the natural inclination of a
rising power to want to expand its influence, which would require
reducing or eliminating the United States' role in the region. According
to Friedberg, [China faces a difficult dilemma, because U.S. security
guarantees reduce Japan's need for nuclear weapons and larger
conventional forces.]{.underline} "If it is to establish itself in a
position of unquestioned predominance in East Asia," writes Friedberg,
"China must ªnd a way to bring Taiwan back, and push America out, while
keeping Japan down."37 As a result, China's strategy and pace for
achieving regional hegemony is still to be decided; what is clear,
according to his analysis, is the direction in which China wants to
head. In contrast, [Michael Swaine concludes that "neither China's
existing grand strategy nor public PRC \[People's Republic of China\]
documents, statements, and formal policy actions provide conclusive
evidence of . . . \[a\] commitment to undermine or replace U.S.
power."**38 This is consistent with my view, grounded in defensive
realist logic, that China can be very secure with the United States
maintaining its alliances and forward deployment. Given that hegemony
would provide only a small increase in its security, China should find
the risks unwarranted**]{.underline}. The only signifcant caveat
concerns the U.S. ability to pressure China with a blockade during a
conflict over Taiwan.39 However, whether China has nonsecurity motives
for pursuing regional hegemony---including ideational rationales for
wanting to be the region's dominant power---is a separate question.40 If
it does, then the current U.S. grand strategy will be incompatible with
China's goals, and intense competition is likely to ensue. [The nature
and extent of China's motives and ambitions are possibly the key factors
determining whether U.S. accommodation would, on net, contribute to U.S.
objectives in Asia]{.underline}. Assessing the motives of a rising power
is diffcult because increased military capability could enhance the
ability, and therefore the willingness, of both greedy states and
security seekers to achieve expansionist geopolitical objectives.41 The
China case is further complicated by disagreements about the
geopolitical status quo, which lead the United States and China to
divergent views of whether efforts to acquire disputed territory reflect
greedy or security motives.42 Many American experts are increasingly
concerned that China's ambitions and assertiveness are growing in step
with its power.43 Other experts, however, question whether this is
true.44 Therefore, U.S. policy toward China will necessarily involve
balancing the risks generated by this uncertainty. **[From the United
States' perspective, there is broad agreement on Taiwan--- China's goal
of unifcation makes China a limited-aims expansionist
state.]{.underline}** Whether this desire to revise the status quo
reflects greedy or security-seeking motives, however, is a complicated
matter, because China and the United States disagree about what
constitutes the status quo. [From China's perspective, control of Taiwan
is a security objective because China considers Taiwan part of its
homeland.45 In contrast, given the United States' understanding of the
status quo, China's determination to control Taiwan reflects greedy
motives]{.underline}. Since the late 2000s, with the change in Taiwan's
leadership, cross-strait relations have been increasingly good; thus,
the Taiwan issue has not fueled growing concern about China's
assertiveness.

the United States and China must inevitably go to war or that China's
rise is occurring at the expense of the United States. The short version
of his tale is that a second cold war is neither necessary nor
desirable. The author [relies on his background in the U.S. government

distrust." A recent study by two leading authorities on U.S.-China
relations concludes that Beijing views **U.S. arms sales to Taiwan** "as
confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere in China's
domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from occurring,
thereby harming a clearly-articulated Chinese core
interes]{.underline}t." In a similar vein, their report argues that
"continuing to provide Taiwan with advanced weapons . . . is viewed as
pernicious in Chinese eyes and has added to suspicion that Washington
will disregard Chinese interests and sentiments as long as China's power
position is secondary to America's.

Taiwan is doomed. The numbers prove it. Or so we are told. Every year
the U.S. Department of Defense publishes the statistics. Taiwan's
defense budget is \$10 billion. China's is \$154 billion. There are
almost a million active duty soldiers in the People's Liberation Army
versus 140,000 ground troops across the strait. Taiwan has 420 fighters
versus China's 1,490 and 23 ships versus China's 240. Taiwan has two
modern attack submarines, while China has 52. The cross-strait military
balance seems hopeless and the conventional wisdom is that the threat of
U.S. intervention in the event of an invasion is the only thing
deterring Beijing from reunifying the island by force. In the face of
such overwhelming odds, however, Taiwan's military has not given up. In
fact, they've greatly improved their chances for survival.

Last year, Taiwan's Chief of the General Staff, Adm. Lee Hsi-ming
quietly proposed a revolutionary new approach to Taiwan's defense,
called the Overall Defense Concept. This new concept, if effectively
implemented, could turn the tables and give Taiwan a fighting chance of
preventing China from being able to take it by force.

China considers Taiwan a rogue province --- an unresolved remnant of the
civil war that otherwise ended in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's defeated
forces retreated to Taiwan under the protection of the U.S. Navy. The
U.S. military maintained a presence in Taiwan until the normalization of
diplomatic relations with China in 1979. [China has stated its intent to
reunify Taiwan by force if necessary, and built up its military with the
aim of both invading Taiwan and preventing the U.S. military from coming
to the island's defense in time.]{.underline}

Taiwan has historically been dependent on the United States to deter
China through both the threat of intervention and the provision of arms.
The Taiwan Relations Act requires the United States to maintain the
ability to defend Taiwan and provide it with "arms of a defensive
character." Taiwan's military has closely mirrored its U.S. counterpart,
in miniature, for years, sending its officers to U.S. military school
houses, training together, and acquiring both new and used military
platforms sold by the U.S. government. Taiwan's military is now a
hodgepodge of U.S and indigenously built systems. Its American systems
range from the cutting edge to the antique. Taiwan's AH-64E Apache
attack helicopter is newer than the model fielded by the U.S. Army in
the United States Indo-Pacific Command's area of responsibility.
Taiwan's F-16s are being retrofitted to include new capabilities that
U.S. Air Force pilots are jealous of. However, Vietnam-era systems like
M-60 tanks, Knox-class frigates, and F-5 fighters are also found in
Taiwan's arsenal. Each of Taiwan's services is in desperate need of
recapitalization and it is tempting to look at U.S.-made next-gen
frigates, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and F-35s as logical candidates.

[The problem with buying U.S. systems wholesale is that they are
expensive, designed to project power over great distances, and maximize
mobility and networks to take the fight to the enemy with overwhelming
superiority. Taiwan on the other hand, needs the opposite: systems that
are short-range and defensive, able to survive an initial bombardment
from a larger adversary, and suitable for deployment close to home in
defense of the island should it come under blockade or attack. Despite
mirror-imaging the U.S. military in its doctrine, training, and
capabilities for decades, Taiwan has begun to chart its own
course.]{.underline}

[Taiwan's new defense concept employs an asymmetric defense strategy,
where Taiwan maximizes its defense advantages, and targets an invading
force when it is at its weakest. Whereas Taiwan's previous strategy
focused on fighting across the entire Taiwan Strait and defeating the
enemy through attrition, the new concept divides Taiwan's defense
operations into two phases, both closer to Taiwan's shores where the
lines of communication are short and Taiwan's forces can benefit from
land-based air denial and more effective surveillance and
reconnaissance.]{.underline}

The first phase is the decisive battle in the littoral, extending up to
100 kilometers from the island. Key capabilities at this phase will
include sea mines, and large surface vessels equipped with Taiwan's
capable, domestically manufactured anti-ship cruise missiles, the Hsiung
Feng 2 and 3. Taiwan's surface fleet includes larger vessels from the
legacy force, such as French-built Lafayette class frigates, U.S.-built
Kidd-class destroyers, and U.S.-designed Perry class frigates armed with
both Hsiung Feng and Harpoon missiles, as well as a new class of fast
attack Tuojiang class catamarans that carry 16 missiles. Taiwan also
fields anti-ship Hsiung Feng missiles mounted on trucks that will
disperse in order to survive initial strikes. While evading detection in
Taiwan's urban and mountainous terrain, they will launch strikes at
surface ships throughout an invasion.

The second phase seeks to annihilate the enemy at the beach area, which
extends approximately 40 kilometers outwards from anticipated invasion
beaches. This phase calls for Taiwan's navy to lay mines in deep and
shallow waters off suspected landing beaches. A new fleet of automated,
fast minelaying ships are being built for that mission. In the interim,
mine-launching rails can be installed on several classes of surface
vessels. While invading ships are slowed by mine fields, swarms of small
fast attack boats and truck-launched anti-ship cruise missiles will
target key ships in the invasion force, particularly amphibious landing
ships carrying the initial wave of PLA assault troops as well as
roll-on-roll-off vessels carrying follow-on vehicles and armor.

The Taiwan Army comes into play at this phase, laying beach mines, and
targeting enemy ships with precision fires, including minesweepers.
Precision artillery will target any vessels and troops reaching shore,
using area effects weapons such as indigenously built multiple launch
rocket systems with cluster munitions, and attack helicopters including
AH-64E Apaches. The Taiwan Air Force will seek to deny Chinese fighters,
bombers and drones from Taiwan's battlespace by deploying integrated air
defenses, including Patriot PAC-3 batteries and domestically
manufactured Tian Kung-2 surface to air missiles that are assigned to
defend air bases and critical infrastructure, and smaller mobile air
defense systems, such as U.S.-provided Avenger systems to prevent the
PLA Air Force from providing close-in air support to their invading
forces.

Mines and Missiles

Sea mines are a critical capability at the heart of the Overall Defense
Concept. Historically, sea mines have proven difficult to counter, and
effective at slowing invasion forces. In the Korean War, the U.S.
invasion force at Incheon landed before North Koreans could deploy sea
mines. U.S. forces landed quickly, met heavy resistance ashore, and
found warehouses full of mines after they cleared the beach. At the
attack on Wonson a month later, sea mines were deployed offshore before
the planned invasion. Two minesweepers were destroyed by mines while
under fire from shore-based artillery, and clearing operations took two
weeks. U.S. Marine and Army units embarked on transports had to wait
five days offshore for lanes to be cleared, which only happened after
North Korean forces abandoned their positions.

The government-led National Chung Shan Institute for Science and
Technology (NCSIST), Taiwan's main designer and manufacturer of defense
articles, is currently developing two new types of shallow and
deep-water influence mines, which they plan to deploy by 2021. They are
also developing a self-propelled mine with a planned deployment date
around 2025. Until then, Taiwan has been refurbishing its current mine
inventory, which includes domestically manufactured Wan Xiang mines, and
MK-6 mines acquired from the United States. Taiwan has also sought
U.S.-manufactured MK62 Quickstrike air-deployed mines, which could be
rapidly deployed by C-130s or P-3Cs, but the sale of that critical
capability has not yet been approved by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The Hsiung Feng 2 and 3 missiles are the other weapons at the heart of
the Overall Defense Concept. These missiles are fielded by surface ships
and fired ashore from a handful of vulnerable fixed batteries, and from
batteries of truck launchers. With the expectation that large surface
ships will be primary targets neutralized early in a conflict, the
Overall Defense Concept also relies on small fast attack vessels, such
as the 112-foot long Kuang Hwa which mounts four Hsiung Feng missiles,
and can be quickly reloaded in austere locations such as small fishing
ports that dot Taiwan's coastline. The Taiwan Navy is reportedly
acquiring an even smaller vessel that carries two missiles. NCSIST is
upgrading missiles and increasing production of anti-ship cruise
missiles, land attack cruise missiles, and surface-to-air missiles to
arm new ships and launchers, deepen magazines, and ensure that Taiwan's
armed forces have sufficient munitions to hold out for an extended
period.

Force Preservation

Force preservation is a critical aspect of the Overall Defense Concept.
Survivability and continued effectiveness following initial PLA strikes
have taken on greater urgency, especially as China's investments in
anti-access/area-denial and power projection capabilities are
anticipated to slow a U.S. response force. Taiwan is already experienced
in hardening its military infrastructure to withstand attacks, and the
Overall Defense Concept calls on the military to increase investments in
key capabilities including mobility, deception, camouflage, concealment,
jamming, redundancy, rapid repair, and reconstitution. While these
attributes are often neglected by militaries around the world because
they are not visible or prestigious, the new defense concept recognizes
that they are a critical aspect of Taiwan's credible deterrence and
prioritizes them in the competition for scarce defense dollars.

Orphans of the Overall Defense Concept

[The new concept is animated by the most critical mission of the Taiwan
military: denying China the ability to land and resupply an invasion
force.]{.underline} Beijing can use blockades, coercion, hybrid warfare,
or "gray zone" pressure, but the only thing that guarantees Beijing can
achieve its political objective of Taiwan's surrender is putting Chinese
boots on the ground and physically seizing control of the island.
Preventing that outcome is therefore the most fundamental mission.
Taiwan's military also has a multitude of peacetime missions and other
potential contingencies that it must man, train, and equip for. Taiwan
will therefore continue to invest in platforms that do not directly
support the concept, or are unlikely to survive the initial waves of
fire strikes that are expected to precede an invasion.

Taiwan's vulnerable runways and the inability to disperse outside the
range of Chinese strikes makes the Taiwan Air Force's fixed-wing assets
unlikely to play a decisive role in a conflict. The president of Taiwan
has expressed interest in acquiring F-35B short-takeoff fighters, but
even that capable aircraft is unlikely to be able to operate effectively
following PLA strikes that will devastate Taiwan's airbases. The Taiwan
Air Force's future fighter will primarily serve a deterrent role
defending Taiwan's airspace in peacetime. The Air Force will make its
wartime contributions with mobile air defenses, small drones, and
maintaining critical infrastructure to enable a joint defense. The
Taiwan Navy is building large amphibious transport vessels and a future
large air defense destroyer, which are also likely to be targeted and
sunk in the early phases of a conflict. It is unclear what role Taiwan's
future Indigenous Defense Submarine will play targeting the surface
ships of an invasion force since it is assumed it will be a large,
conventional diesel electric design similar to its existing two
submarines, optimized for deep, open water, rather than the shallows
found in the Taiwan Strait.

Investments in submarines, large surface vessels, and fighter aircraft
are necessary for Taiwan to re-capitalize its aging legacy force so the
Air Force and Navy can continue to provide peacetime deterrence. The
challenge for Taiwan is ensuring that there is adequate defense funding
for these large, prestige-enhancing platforms (that are the darlings of
their service chiefs), as well as the small, maneuverable, and
survivable asymmetric systems that are critical to Taiwan's survival.

Cooperation with the United States

[Taiwan's new defense concept presents both challenges and opportunities
for cooperation with the U.S. military. Sales of large, expensive
U.S.-made arms have certain benefits --- they are a visible and tangible
signal of U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense, which boosts morale in
Taiwan and uncertainty in Beijing, and they are a critical form of
political deterrence in that respect. U.S.-supplied systems also provide
the potential for interoperability with the U.S. military, and
potentially other countries in the region.]{.underline} Taiwan's
proximity to China is an advantage that could benefit networked U.S.
forces operating at greater stand-off distances. For example, a sensor
operated by Taiwan could feed data to networked U.S. planes and ships
operating at a distance to increase their awareness of threats and
improve targeting.

One challenge is that Taiwan's defense needs are diverging from the
expertise and systems the U.S. military can provide. For example, the
U.S. Marine Corps does not have a dedicated opposing force that Taiwan
could train with to hone their skills in defending beaches. Commanders
of Taiwan's squadrons of small fast attack boats can find no counterpart
in the U.S. Navy to train with. U.S. Navy mine warfare is
under-resourced, unappreciated and mines are considered a problem, not a
solution. Offensive mining may be making a comeback, however, in light
of the U.S. strategy identifying China as a key threat. The U.S. Navy
has recently signaled its developing interest in mine warfare, publicly
demonstrating the deployment of Quickstrike mines from a B-52 in
September during exercise Valiant Shield 18. With every challenge comes
opportunity. As the U.S. Army develops its multi-domain battle concept
and applies it to the Indo-Pacific, it will increasingly realize that
China is the challenge, and the battlespace is Taiwan. Adm. Harry
Harris, then commanding Pacific Command, spoke at the Association of the
U.S. Army conference in 2016, reduced the task to, "Army's got to be
able to sink ships." U.S. Army could find solutions and opportunities
for expanding their reach into the maritime domain by studying and
innovating alongside their counterparts in Taiwan.

Conclusion

The beauty of Adm. Lee's Overall Defense Concept is that it embraces an
asymmetric strategy, does not seek to compete with China's larger
military head on, and focuses Taiwan's resources on targeting the
greatest threat, while surviving long enough for third-party
intervention. It eschews traditional symmetrical warfighting of surface
action groups, fighter planes, or tanks slugging it out head-to-head.
Instead, it takes a page from guerilla warfare and envisions large
numbers of small, affordable, highly mobile units taking advantage of
the terrain to defeat a larger enemy. U.S. defense experts should
consider these concepts as well as they contemplate how the U.S.
military can address the threat from increasingly capable adversaries.
With its new Overall Defense Concept, opportunities for collaboration
with Taiwan to address asymmetric challenges will increase.

[Deterring China from seeking to reunify Taiwan by force will continue
to be a complex equation.]{.underline} [The threat of U.S. intervention
remains the most critical factor, but as the People's Liberation Army
continues to modernize and expand, including anti-access/area denial
capabilities designed to challenge a U.S. intervention, Taiwan's own
defense capabilities become increasingly important.]{.underline} The
survivability of Taiwan's military, particularly its combat
effectiveness weeks after a conflict begins, and the ability to slow and
attrite an invading force is critical to buy time for the U.S. to
intervene. Adm. Lee has made a courageous proposal to set Taiwan on that
crucial course which will continue to assure cross-strait stability
despite the threat from an increasingly capable adversary.

**Gjoza 6/11**/19 (Enea Gjoza, fellow at Defense Priorities and a
graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, "The US Wants to
Sell Taiwan the Wrong Weapons", Defense One,
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/06/us-wants-sell-taiwan-wrong-weapons/157630/)

The United States is in negotiations to sell Taiwan \$2 billion in
weapons, a move sure to upset Beijing. Ensuring that Taiwan can credibly
deter an invasion on its own is a worthy goal. Given the existing, if
ambiguous, U.S. security commitment to the ROC, a conflict in the Taiwan
Strait risks drawing the United States into a broader war with China.
However, this weapons package fails to materially improve Taiwan's
defenses and continues to saddle the United States with most of the
(putative) defensive burden. A better approach is to push Taiwan to
acquire more countermeasures to China's naval and air forces, thereby
increasing the cost of a Chinese invasion.

The proposed arms package includes 108 main battle tanks, 250 Stinger
anti-air missiles, as well as 409 Javelin and 1,240 TOW anti-tank
missiles. This would be fine if Taiwan were preparing for a ground war,
but the real conflict if China invades will be at sea and in the air.
Taiwan should focus on acquiring the most cost-effective methods of
stopping a Chinese invading force before it lands.

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan is not inevitable. Beijing has shown little
interest in territorial conquest: since the founding of the People's
Republic, PRC troops have conquered territory in three nations (North
Korea, India, and Vietnam) that they subsequently relinquished
voluntarily. But Taiwan is different, given its historical, linguistic,
and ethnic ties to China, and its strategic value. And so the risk of a
Chinese invasion remains the organizing challenge for Taiwan's military.

U.S. efforts to provide Taiwan with weaponry have long hinged on a
faulty strategy: that Taiwan only needs to be strong enough to hold out
before the United States intervenes on its behalf. As China's
capabilities grow, a scenario in which America fights a great power war
over Taiwan looks like an increasingly poor tradeoff.

Taiwan can draw important lessons from its main adversary on how to deal
with a superior challenger. In seeking to limit American power in the
Western Pacific, China has built up anti-access/area denial capabilities
that can cost-effectively counter U.S. carrier battle groups and
land-based aircraft.

Advances in radar, sensor, and missile technology have increased the
advantage that defenders typically enjoy in war. China's A2/AD network
of radar, sensors, and weapons (surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship
missiles, etc.) can impose prohibitive costs on the expensive U.S.
assets that would operate near its shores in a conflict. Taiwan should
capitalize on these technological trends and focus its military spending
on building out its own A2/AD capabilities to defend against invasion.

The ROC currently spends \$10.5 billion annually on its military, a tiny
fraction of the PRC's \$239 billion. China also maintains a (vastly)
numerically superior and in many aspects qualitatively superior military
than Taiwan. Aircraft or warships deployed by Taiwan in a conflict would
also be in range of China's A2/AD defenses, further compounding the
disadvantage.

The scarcity of Taiwanese defense dollars and Taiwan's inability to
match China one-for-one in ships and aircraft makes it especially
important to invest in weapons that maximize the cost to an invader.
Tanks and TOW missiles do not provide that, but a robust A2/AD network
would.

Taiwan should reduce investment in long-range strike platforms and
fighter aircraft (it has asked for an assortment of cutting-edge U.S.
fighters), and instead grow its stockpile of anti-air and anti-ship
missiles. The Taiwanese can improve their air defenses by buying more
MIM-104 Patriot batteries and accompanying missiles. They should also
shift investments away from large surface vessels that can easily be
spotted and sunk, and instead build out a fleet of rapid attack boats
and fast corvettes (like the Tuo Jiang class) equipped with anti-ship
missiles.

To defend its radar and sensors, the most vulnerable and most important
part of an A2/AD network, Taiwan should add more of them and harden the
defenses around them. It should also, as a 2017 report from RAND
advised, develop survivable high-altitude airborne sensors and
distributed ground-based sensors that can be continually moved in the
event of war.

In addition to making these weapons available for sale, Washington
should push Taiwan to shift away from flashy but limited value weapons,
and instead develop a native defensive capability that is both practical
and robust. While it might seem strange for the United States to dictate
a foreign nation's military acquisitions, our current policy commits
American lives and assets to Taiwan's defense. As long as that persists,
it is the responsibility of U.S. policymakers to ensure Taiwan provides
the most favorable operational environment possible.

For every big-ticket weapons sale to Taiwan, the United States bears a
political cost with China. The weapons transferred must therefore
contribute to a sound defensive strategy and deter rather than invite
armed conflict. By empowering Taiwan to properly defend itself, the U.S.
can dodge the politically treacherous question of just how far it is
willing to go in Taiwan's defense, and incentivize China to seek a
peaceful resolution to the Taiwan question.

# cp -- only small defensive arms

#### \[edit/needs to be checked\] Plan: The United States Federal Government should only sell small defensive arms to Taiwan

#### Small defensive arm sales solves -- maintains US commitments and creates US-Taiwan-China stabilization

**Ding '17** (Yu Ding, graduate student at Elliott School of
International Affairs, George Washington University, "A Smarter Way to
Sell Arms to Taiwan", International Policy Digest, 12/01/17,
https://intpolicydigest.org/2017/12/02/a-smarter-way-to-sell-arms-to-taiwan/)

On the Kinmen Island only a few miles east of mainland China, Taiwan
deploys anti-ship missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, monitoring
radar and remote howitzers. [Among these arms directly pointing at
China, the most advanced ones are from the United States.]{.underline}

[Every round of U.S. eye-catching and pricy arms package sales to Taiwan
irritates China.]{.underline} These sales of advanced armaments lead to
intense condemnation of Washington and sanctions against U.S. companies.
[However, by changing current arms package sales to the approach of a
steady stream of small deals, the United States can relieve tensions
with China and better fulfill its security commitment to
Taiwan.]{.underline}

The U.S. has sold arms to Taiwan since establishing diplomatic relations
with the People's Republic of China. These arms sales help the U.S. to
fulfill the security commitment to the island based on the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA). [However, with the current approach, the U.S. is
failing to help Taiwan to deter China, and also risks U.S.-Taiwan-China
trilateral relations.]{.underline}

[Instead, the U.S. can sell more arms, especially those for defensive
purposes, to Taiwan in a steady stream of small increments.]{.underline}
The U.S. should announce and deliver arms packages separately, bringing
the price tag for each sale below \$1 billion. The advantages of this
approach are significant:

[Bolster U.S. credibility. China's severe complaints about U.S. arms
sales raise insecurity and doubts not only in Taiwan, but also with
other U.S. allies in the region: South Korea and Japan. With the
suggested approach---selling more arms, but below the radar
---]{.underline} [the United States can uphold its security commitments
as well as international obligations. It will significantly enhance U.S.
credibility in the region, especially among U.S. allies.]{.underline}

[Stabilize U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral relations.]{.underline} [Smaller
arms deals between the U.S. and Taiwan are much less likely to
irritate]{.underline} [China. China will find it difficult to impose
severe sanctions because of an arms deal only worth millions of
dollars.]{.underline} The U.S. has been balancing between China and
Taiwan since 1979, and has successfully avoided significant conflict
across the strait. Peace has provided the environment for the growth of
Taiwan's democracy, as well as the vast increase of trade between the
U.S. and China. This policy will help the U.S. to maintain the status
quo.

[Secure Taiwan and its democracy. The increased number of arms sold will
equip Taiwan with better capability to deter China. If China were to
conduct an attack, Taiwan would be able to resist longer before the U.S.
came to rescue.]{.underline} Facing the rapid rise of Chinese military
power and the prospect of decreased U.S. arms sales, Taiwan has become
more and more vulnerable against China. This policy will help to secure
Taiwan and its democracy.

How can the U.S. implement this policy effectively? [The U.S. can reach
a private agreement on larger multi-year deals with Taiwan, in order to
keep arms production lines open.]{.underline} [However, public
announcements of arms agreements should be small and
incremental]{.underline}. Like past arms deals, the arms sales under
this policy can be operated by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
in the Department of Defense. Even though there is a chance that China
may find out about the private agreement, it will be hard for China to
create a pretext for war building on rumors.

The U.S. has been keeping "a robust unofficial relationship" with Taiwan
for decades. This relationship has assisted the "Taiwan Economic
Miracle" in the 1980s, promoted Taiwan's democratization in the 1990s,
and secured the well-being and confidence of Taiwanese people in the
21st century. [U.S. support underpins Taiwan's sovereignty and
democracy, and arms sales are the central element of that support.
Moreover, the U.S. security commitment to Taiwan is vital to the
geopolitical balance in East Asia, hence crucial to the U.S. and its
allies' security.]{.underline}

[With this increased yet less risky arms sale approach to Taiwan, the
U.S. will be able to not only secure Taiwan and its allies in East
Asia]{.underline}, but also the U.S. homeland. Last but not least, [it
will help the U.S. to preserve both the reality and its image as a world
leader and guardian of democracy.]{.underline}

Maintain, and Improve, Taiwan Ties In the 1940s, a vicious debate over
losing China tore at the fabric of U.S. politics. Although China had
never been America's to lose, diplomats, scholars, and politicians
involved in U.S.---China relations suffered. Neither they nor their
attackers could have imagined a time when prominent Americans would
publicly advocate giving away the Republic of China on Taiwan. So should
and will the United States abandon Taiwan? To date, Washington has not
decided to jettison Taiwan. And it should not. [However frightening or
seductive China is, appeasing it by sacrificing Taiwan would not be good
policy. Doing so might simplify and improve U.S.---China relations, but
only temporarily.]{.underline} [China would respond to appeasement as
have virtually all governments: it would conclude that a weaker United
States lacking vision and ambition could be pressured and
manipulated.]{.underline} Both friends and rivals regionally and
globally would decide that the United States was not to be trusted. But,
if the United States will not sever ties, should it nevertheless reduce
its commitments to Taiwan[? For example, should the United States
curtail or forego arms sales? This might appear a compromise, avoiding
both a sharp break and the maintenance of a difficult status quo. The
problem is that such an approach would have largely the same
consequences as abandonment: Beijing would still see it as a
demonstration of weakness, and would seek to take advantage. Ending arms
sales while pledging to defend Taiwan should China launch an unprovoked
attack, as some have suggested, is unworkable because Taiwan would soon
lack the capability to hold out until U.S. forces arrive.23
Alternatively, selling arms, but making clear that the United States
would not intervene, would undermine deterrence since China knows it can
overwhelm Taiwan's limited capability.]{.underline} There is no doubt
that the American people are tired of risk, war, and foreigners with
problems, but they also believe in democracy and freedom. The United
States played a pivotal role in building Taiwan's democratic system,
celebrating it as a role model for Asia in general and China in
particular. China may be economically capitalist as much as communist,
but politically it remains a communist autocracy. Its people are denied
human rights, political participation, and free expression. The contrast
is stark, and the need for the United States to remain engaged with
Taiwan is clear, but this is not enough. Talk of the United States
abandoning Taiwan has to be staunched before it undermines morale in
Taiwan and respect for laws and commitments in the United States. The
Obama administration should stop equivocating and move forward with arms
sales. There will never be a good time to sell weapons to Taiwan.
Diplomacy with China as well as congressional routines and requirements
invariably intervene what former deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs Randall Schriver has called ''the tyranny
of the calendar.'' Upgrading existing aircraft would be welcome, but
Taiwan's aging and shrinking air force also needs new planes. Were the
United States to wait and the F-16 C/D production line to close, Taiwan
would have no other source. Washington might well be faced with the
complicated dilemma of whether to sell even more advanced F-35s.
Washington ought to reassert its longstanding position to Beijing that
sales do not promote Taiwan's separation from the mainland but, in the
current phase of cross-Strait relations, create an environment for
improved China---Taiwan relations. Indeed, in the past two years, the
United States has sold almost \$13 billion in weapons to Taiwan, and
cross-Strait relations are in the best shape in decades. [In the absence
of U.S. backing, Taipei would likely be too insecure and Taiwan's
leaders too vulnerable politically to negotiate with China. Arms sales,
therefore, facilitate cross-Strait compromise and should not be anathema
to Beijing. The United States should also accelerate dialogue with
Taipei to promote increased U.S.---Taiwan trade, reduce Taiwan's growing
isolation from regional and global trading blocks, and prevent yet more
dependence on China.]{.underline} Refusing to talk about a broad range
of economic issues through the only available dispute settlement
mechanism, the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), because
of minor, if politically thorny, problems like U.S. beef exports to
Taiwan is a mistake. And progress should be made on commonplace but
important requests from Taipei to join the U.S. visa waiver program and
conclude a bilateral extradition agreement. Higher-level contact between
U.S. and Taiwan officials ought to occur routinely. Even if presidential
meetings are not possible, dialogue between leaders should be
facilitated by video conferences and regular correspondence.
Cabinet-level visits to Taiwan, five of which occurred during the
Clinton administration alone, could quickly be resumed. The prolonged
and ill-considered hiatus in those visits during the George W. Bush and
early Obama years is self-defeating. Such trips are important
symbolically, but they also improve communication and raise awareness of
common interests. Taiwan's representatives also should be granted better
access to U.S. officials in Washington and not be barred from buildings
such as the Department of State. There is no formal agreement that
requires such restrictions; they are entirely self-imposed. Washington
cannot sustain the U.S.---Taiwan relationship unilaterally. Taipei has
to assign priority to strengthening ties with Washington, even as it
improves relations with Beijing. This will require tackling difficult
domestic political obstacles in Taiwan and should be a bipartisan
endeavor. It will be increasingly important to conduct relations in an
environment of trust and candor. There are risks to a strategy which
strengthens rather than abandons U.S. ties to Taiwan. If Washington
continues to support Taiwan, it must simultaneously find ways to
convince Beijing that the United States does not seek to prevent an
accommodation between Taiwan and China. The United States does not
secretly promote independence or block progress in cross-Strait
relations. Rather, U.S. policy aims at sustaining peaceful conditions in
which Taiwan and China can reach a long-term modus vivendi by
themselves. Although the Six Assurances and the Taiwan Relations Act
attempted to keep the focus of U.S.---Taiwan relations on the United
States and Taiwan, China has always been a critical variable and its
importance is growing. [But those who worry that Taiwan policy will set
back U.S.---China relations ought instead to persuade China that, in the
absence of U.S. support, Taipei would likely lose confidence and put
negotiations with the mainland on hold. An abandoned and isolated Taiwan
might, in desperation, declare independence or even revive efforts to
produce nuclear weapons, not pursue unification as Beijing assumes. So,
in fact, U.S. support is not harmful, but helpful to China's
interests.]{.underline} The course of cross-Strait relations does not
lead inexorably in any one direction. [Taiwan's options remain open. The
United States wants Taiwan stable, peaceful, and democratic for the
people of Taiwan, as a model to others in East Asia, and as assurance of
U.S. credibility and dependability. The United States should not abandon
its principled dedication to freedom of choice, but should strengthen
it.]{.underline}

#### Taiwan arms sales key to maintain assurance

**Eikenberry '12** (Karl Eikenberry, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan from
2009-2011 and is currently the Arthur W. Payne Distinguished Lecturer at
Stanford University, "Stop Ignoring Taiwan", Foreign Policy, May 17
2012, https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/05/17/stop-ignoring-taiwan/)

Taiwan, the world's 18th largest economy, boasts an impressive history
of domestic accomplishments. It is one of very few nations to have
transitioned from authoritarian rule to democracy and from poverty to
prosperity. It now accounts for more trade in goods with the United
States than India does. And it provides a model of political reform for
China, which even Prime Minister Wen Jiabao admitted is needed when he
called for pressing ahead with \"both economic structural reform and
political structural reform\" in March.

All the good news may have led to disinterest in Taiwan in favor of its
bigger neighbor across the strait, but there are facets of the
U.S.-Taiwan relationship that must be addressed: the bilateral inability
to address a dysfunctional arms sale process, Taiwan's insufficient
investment in its own defense, lack of progress on trade caused chiefly
by a dispute over the safety of U.S. beef imports, and America's
inadequate official contact with a major Asian power.

[The argument that the United States should abandon Taiwan altogether by
gradually phasing out arms sales has been convincingly dismissed in
these pages and is unlikely to become policy]{.underline}. But the
current policy drift bears more subtle costs at precisely the time the
United States should be strengthening its existing partnerships in the
Asia-Pacific. There is already troubling evidence that U.S. allies in
the region are hedging their bets, skeptical that the United States will
meet its commitments, and wary of China's rising military power.
American actions toward Taiwan matter to U.S. alliances elsewhere. This
is true even beyond the Asia-Pacific as the United States withdraws from
Afghanistan amid promises to remain engaged there.

The United States should simplify the inefficient and unpredictable
process by which it sells military hardware to Taiwan. Currently,
Taiwan's legislature appropriates funds for weapons programs with no
guarantee the United States will approve the sale; conversely, the
United States approves a sale with no guarantee that it will eventually
transfer the hardware. The four main players --- the executive and
legislative branches of both the United States and Taiwan --- should
collaborate and attempt to put in place a more predictable and credible
process.

[At the same time, the United States should encourage Taiwan to invest
more in its own security. President Ma Ying-jeou has promised Taiwan
will spend 3 percent of GDP on defense but has taken no meaningful steps
toward that goal --- Taiwan spent only 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense
in 2010. Even while Taiwan's neighbors are increasing their defense
budgets in the face of a rising China, Taiwan --- to which China's
military rise poses the most direct threat --- appears over-reliant on
the United States and is under-investing in its defense.]{.underline}

The U.S.-Taiwan trade relationship is similarly unnecessarily
complicated. Beef, although it accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S.
exports to Taiwan, has become a huge political issue in the bilateral
relationship. The controversy originated when Taiwan imposed harsh
restrictions on the import of U.S. beef after the discovery of a case of
mad cow disease in the United States in 2003. While most restrictions
have since been lifted, an additive used in U.S. beef remains the
subject of bitterness and popular protest in Taiwan. Partly as a result,
the United States and Taiwan have not held high-level bilateral trade
talks since 2007. The Taiwanese people debate the issue daily; a growing
number are in essence calling Americans bullies for blaming them over
the impasse. The United States can do more to reassure Taiwan about the
quality of its beef by working collaboratively to develop screening and
quarantine procedures. This dispute should no longer overshadow what
remains an important trading relationship.

Finally, there is work to do on the diplomatic front. The United States
does not recognize Taiwan as a formal state, and Taiwan cannot be called
an \"ally\" of the United States except in the sense of a close friend.
Taiwanese Air Force pilots may be U.S.-trained to fly U.S.-made F-16s,
but the United States remains committed to the One China Policy. The
United States has no embassy in Taipei --- though the staff size of its
de facto embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, is roughly equal
that of the embassy in Seoul --- and sharply restricts high-level
official visits. U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki had to
decline an invitation to Taiwan in 2009 because of his cabinet-level
status; I couldn't return to Taiwan in an official capacity after being
promoted to brigadier general, and only did so this year after retiring
from military and government service in 2011. Taiwan's Defense Minister,
Kao Hua Chu, has yet to visit the United States after holding the post
for two years. The highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Taiwan in the
past decade was Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman, who made the
trek in late 2011.

[The United States' lack of military-to-military and high-level
diplomatic contacts with a key regional player --- on whom the
Asia-Pacific's stability in no small part depends --- undercuts the
purpose of the 2013 Pentagon fiscal priorities announced in January to
increase \"American commitment\" to that that part of the world. The
United States should at the very least publicly reexamine this policy in
light of its costs.]{.underline} In the short term, the United States
should expedite Taiwan's inclusion, currently under review, in the Visa
Waiver Program, which allows travelers from 36 countries to travel to
the United States for business or tourism without a visa.

[The U.S.-Taiwan relationship faces growing risk from complacency on
both sides as each increasingly takes the other for granted to focus
instead on \"getting it right\" with mainland China. Now, the United
States has a brief window of opportunity to get an important friendship
back on track.]{.underline} This fall, the Chinese Communist Party
undergoes its first transition of leadership in nearly a decade. I
anticipate the newly chosen Politburo to be more inward-looking and
risk-averse over the next two years as it moves to consolidate power.
The timing coincides with the House of Representatives' expected
reexamination of Taiwan policy legislation this spring. The U.S. should
use the opportunity to correct emerging problems in its relationship
with Taiwan, before things break and costly fixes are needed.

#### Selling more arms key to maintain alliance

**The Wilson Quarterly '12** (The Wilson Quarterly, magazine published
by the Woodrow Wilson International Centers for Scholars in Washington
DC, "WHY THE U.S. SHOULD STAND BY TAIWAN", Winter 2012,
https://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/winter-2012-lessons-of-the-great-depression/why-the-us-should-stand-by-taiwan/)

Every year China publicly grumbles about the United States\' support of
Taiwan, and every year Washington pretends not to hear. Some U.S.
foreign-policy specialists are sick of this dynamic, arguing, according
to Georgetown University historian Nancy Bernkopf Tucker and analyst
Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
that Taiwan is a "strategic liability, an expensive diversion and . . .
an obstacle to more important U.S.-China relations." Don't take the
bait, say Tucker and Glaser. If anything, the United States should
increase its support of the small democratic island.

[Even if the United States did bow to China's wishes and pull the plug
on its Taiwan support]{.underline}, there is no guarantee that relations
between the rival superpowers would get any smoother, the authors argue.
[China would continue to oppose U.S. interests on nuclear proliferation
in Iran and North Korea. And Beijing would be more likely to view U.S.
capitulation on Taiwan as a cowering dodge]{.underline} than a proffered
olive branch. [Walking away from Taiwan could sap the United States'
negotiating power throughout the region, moreover, and possibly send
friends in the area, such as Japan and South Korea, into China's
arms.]{.underline}

[Scrapping ties to Taiwan would also hurt the U.S. economy.]{.underline}
The two nations have a vibrant economic relationship: Taiwan ranks as
America's ninth-largest trading partner, and the United States is
Taiwan's leading foreign investor. [Furthermore, U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan are big business; the United States has sold almost \$13 billion
in weapons to Taiwan over the past two years.]{.underline}

[To prevent the Chinese from even thinking that Washington is going to
relinquish its commitment, the United States should step up its
engagement with Taiwan]{.underline}, Tucker and Glaser argue. The
priorities: making progress on stalled negotiations on trade, a U.S.
visa waiver program, and a bilateral extradition agreement. [Without the
United States' support, Taiwan would almost certainly "be compelled, in
some form, to accommodate China's unification agenda," possibly laying
to rest one of Asia's most successful forays into
democracy.]{.underline}

#### Maintaining alliance key to deter China

During a Hawaiian "transit stop" Wednesday, [Taiwan's President Tsai
Ing-wen praised the U.S.-Taiwan relationship as "stronger than
ever."]{.underline} But here in Taiwan, it's China that dominates every
discussion. Beijing's malign influence is apparent everywhere, while the
United States is seen as largely absent. [Washington must wake up to the
danger of China's massive effort to infiltrate, undermine and eventually
abolish Taiwan's democracy.]{.underline}

Tsai called for Washington's help to confront Beijing's comprehensive
campaign to exert control over Taiwanese politics and society, which is
steadily eroding a 40-year status quo that has kept a shaky peace. The
1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which governs the U.S.-Taiwan relationship,
stipulates that the United States will "consider any effort to determine
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts
or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
area and of grave concern to the United States."

In 2019, those words ring hollow. Xi Jinping's government brazenly uses
economic and political pressure to interfere in Taiwan --- an attempt to
turn the Taiwanese people and their leaders toward Beijing and against
the West. Xi himself smashed the status quo in January when he publicly
called for Taiwan to rejoin China under the "One Country, Two Systems"
model. One look at Hong Kong should be enough for any Taiwanese citizen
to realize that means a steady erosion of their freedoms and
sovereignty.

During interviews with Taiwanese politicians, officials and national
security experts, our delegation in Taiwan, organized by the East West
Center, heard grave warnings. Following its successful interference
effort in last November's local elections, Beijing is now focused
intensely on ousting Tsai and her Democratic People's Party in next
January's presidential contest.

"Next year's election might be the last meaningful election in Taiwan.
After that, it will be a Hong Kong-style election," said Chen Ming-Chi,
deputy minister of the Mainland Affairs Council. [If China succeeds in
returning the Beijing-sympathetic Nationalist Party (KMT) to power, that
could be the tipping point after which Taiwan can never again exert its
own sovereignty, he said.]{.underline} "2020 would be the beginning of
the reunification."

[In other words, a Chinese military invasion is no longer the scenario
Taiwanese fear most. China's strategy to take over Taiwan is focused now
on the hybrid warfare tactics authoritarian regimes increasingly deploy
in free societies.]{.underline} Pro-Beijing interests have bought up a
huge portion of Taiwanese media and coordinate with Beijing to spread
propaganda and fake news and manipulate social media.

The Chinese government uses economic coercion to both recruit and punish
Taiwanese leaders. Meanwhile, China is working overtime to strip Taiwan
of its diplomatic allies and keep it out of multilateral institutions.
Beijing is literally trying to erase the country from the map.

Taiwan is the testing ground for these methods, but China is now
exporting them to other places, including the United States. That's a
threat not just to Taiwan but also to democracies worldwide, said Deputy
Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien.

"Taiwan is only the beginning," he said. "They want their new
civilization to become a new global order. That's what they are
thinking. And together with an expansion of their physical power, now
they are putting their dreams into reality."

Several KMT officials and former officials told our delegation fears of
China were overblown and seeking accommodation with Beijing was the only
reasonable approach. Former deputy foreign minister Bruce Linghu said
the KMT is not "pro-China" but rather "pro-peace."

"Taiwan has to play it smart," he said. "Why should we be provocative
with China?"

KMT officials insist they support the U.S.-China relationship and are
not trying to appease Beijing. But actions speak louder than words.
While Tsai was speaking to Americans, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, a
rising KMT leader and presidential prospect, was holding controversial
meetings with Chinese Communist Party officials in Hong Kong and Macau.
It's clear which relationship the KMT prioritizes.

[The U.S. interest in helping the current Taiwanese government defend
its democracy from Chinese interference and aggression is understood ---
but our will is under question.]{.underline} The Trump administration,
despite being full of pro-Taiwan officials, has been inconsistent.
There's progress on arms sales but no progress on what Tsai wants most,
a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement. There's not enough U.S. support for
Taiwan's fight against China's hybrid warfare approach.

[In reality, accommodation with Beijing likely won't work and China's
appetite in Taiwan will only grow with the eating.]{.underline} Taiwan
proves that democracy and Chinese culture can work together and that
prosperity need not require repression. This is an example that Beijing,
for obvious reasons, cannot tolerate. Taiwan's very existence plays into
the Chinese Communist Party's deep insecurity.

[But time is running out fast for the United States to show the
Taiwanese people they have international support for refusing to
acquiesce to Beijing's dominance over their politics, economy and
society.]{.underline}

### 2nc -- solvency -- deterrence

#### Arm sales to Taiwan key to deterrence

**Weitz '16** (Richard Weitz, Senior Fellow and Director of the Center
of Political-Military Analysis at Hudson Institute, "Taiwan Arms Deal
Aims To Reduce Cross-Strait Tensions", China US Focus, 1/12/16,
https://www.chinausfocus.com/peace-security/taiwan-arms-deal-aims-to-reduce-cross-strait-tensions)

On December 16, 2015, the U.S. State Department approved a
\$1.83-billion arms sale to Taiwan, the first such agreement since 2011.
The weapons include mostly additional units of systems already in the
Taiwanese inventory, such as Stinger MANPADS, BGM-71 TOW 2B, AAV-7
amphibious assault vehicles, and a pair of Oliver Hazard Perry-class
frigates. The deal also includes communications and other enabling
technologies. However, the current sale is considerably smaller than its
recent predecessors, which included around \$6 billion worth of
armaments in 2010 and in 2011, and excludes advanced warplanes,
submarines, or "offensive" weapons.

[The United States has been selling weapons to Taiwan for decades and
the mainland government has long sought to end them.]{.underline} In
October 2008, for example, after the Bush administration indicated that
it would sell Taiwan \$6.5 billion in military equipment, the Chinese
government suspending almost a dozen China-U.S. military exchange
programs---cancelling high-level defense visits, denying U.S. Navy ships
access to Chinese ports, and postponing meetings on nonproliferation,
humanitarian assistance, disaster relief.

[The Chinese government's response to the most recent U.S. government
arms sales has thus far been less severe. PRC representatives criticized
the decision in public, protested directly to U.S. diplomats, and
threated to retaliate against the U.S. companies involved in the
sales.]{.underline} But there have been no cancellation of military
exchanges r other bilateral programs.

The damage was limited due to arguably excessive U.S. restraint in
providing more advanced systems (even though the PLA already has them),
the improvement in cross-Strait ties seen most recently in the 2014
presidential summit in Singapore, the current Chinese government's
increased interest in sustaining China-U.S. defense relations, and the
preoccupation of both governments with other security differences, such
as Chinese and U.S. military activities in the South China Sea.

[The United States has assured Taiwan that it would not set a date to
end these arms sales or consult in advance about these transactions and
committed to Beijing to limit these sales and support a one-China
policy]{.underline}. Future damage in relations between all three actors
could be reduced further if the United States made more frequent if
smaller sales (yearly rather than every few years), if Taiwanese and
Chinese politicians refrain from provocative statements and actions on
this issue, and if Chinese policy makers better understand why the
United States will likely continue these sales.

By waiting until 2015, the Obama administration has created the longest
gap in major arms sales to the island since the White House was
congressionally mandated to support the Taiwanese military in 1979. The
U.S. government has a legal obligation to continue such sales in the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) adopted in April of that year. Although
ending the 1954 Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, the TRA commits the
United States to supply Taiwan with the weapons it needs to maintain a
"sufficient self-defense capability." However, the legislation does not
mandate any minimum volume of sales and Congress must approve each
transaction. The transfers would be seen as more normal if they occurred
more regularly.

The decision to finalize the more recent arms sale so close to the
January 2016 presidential legislative elections in Taiwan likely
reflects a U.S. decision to reaffirm support for Taiwan's democratic
credentials, discourage Chinese interference in Taiwan's political
process, and give Washington more leverage to influence the policies of
the next Taiwanese government.

[From the perspective of regional stability, U.S. officials have
justified these weapons sales on the grounds that they help sustain the
peaceful status quo in the Straits by partially balancing the PLA's
growing capabilities and thereby discouraging either party from using
military coercion or taking other unilateral actions that threaten the
other]{.underline}. If the Taiwanese concluded that the cross-Strait
balance was rapidly shifting against them, they might preemptively
declare independence as a separate country before the military situation
became too unfavorable.

[In addition, Washington worries that declining to assist the Taiwanese
military could encourage Beijing to adopt aggressive policies toward
Taipei, increasing the risks of a Sino-American confrontation through
miscalculation and thereby inflicting a major economic shock on China,
Taiwan, the United States, and other countries. China's 2005
Anti-Secession Law authorizes the use of force if Beijing concludes that
peaceful reunification efforts will prove unsuccessful.]{.underline}

[U.S. officials have also feared that stopping conventional arms sales
to Taiwan could have the untoward effect of prompting a panicky Taipei
and other U.S. security partners, such as Japan and South Korea, to
pursue nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, or other destabilizing
strategic weapons.]{.underline} Each of these three actors has been
building offensive conventional weapons and they have the capacity to
make nuclear weapons.

From a moral perspective, Taiwan is an attractive partner for Americans
given its democratic political system, with competitive multi-party
elections in which the results are not decided in advance, and its other
political and economic freedoms. Under present circumstances, the
transfer of the PRC's political system to the island would result in a
setback for the global democracy and human rights agenda supported by
the United States.

From a realpolitik perspective, Taiwan contributes to U.S. security in
multiple ways, from serving as a strategic indicator regarding how China
will use its growing international power to reinforcing the credibility
of the U.S. security guarantees that underpin the East Asian security
architecture that has promote regional peace and prosperity, including
to the benefit of China and the United States.

[From the bargaining perspective, the U.S. administration cannot seem to
yield to Chinese threats to suspend defense exchanges or otherwise
punish the United States over the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or
related questions.]{.underline} Not only would encourage negotiators
from China and other countries to think they can achieve more gains from
further threats, but a stream of unbalanced U.S. concessions would
undermine domestic public confidence and support for a generally
cooperative U.S. government policy toward China.

[Fundamentally, the United States continues its policy of strategic
ambiguity, not taking sides on what Taiwan's ultimate fate should be,
but insisting that Beijing-Taipei differences should be settled by
peaceful means. U.S. arms sales policy have sought to balance enhancing
Taiwan's defense capacity without emboldening rash Taiwanese actions,
and to deter Beijing without provoking the Chinese]{.underline}
[government]{.underline}. The United States could suffer as much as any
actor from military conflict between China and Taiwan.

[By providing the weapons, the United States has arguably made Taipei
more confident about working with Beijing to reduce cross-Strait
tensions in recent years. Continuing arms sales will help provide the
reassurance the Taiwanese need to engage with Beijing in coming years
without really threatening China, as even Chinese scholars acknowledge,
presenting a security threat to China.]{.underline}

The best way to promote cross-Strait cooperation is for China to
continue its economic and political reforms and to reduce its military
threat to Taipei, beginning with a reduction in the Chinese missiles
aimed at Taiwan. A constructive reunification process will require the
support of a large majority of the Taiwanese people, which is currently
lacking but can be achieved through wise policies in Beijing

#### Increasing arm sales key to deter China

**Galen '00** (Ted Galen Carpenter, senior fellow for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in US diplomatic
history from the University of Texas, "Increase Arms Sales to Taiwan",
Cato Institute, 12/22/00,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/increase-arms-sales-taiwan)

As tensions continue to simmer between the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan, the Bush administration will come under increasing pressure
to provide Taiwan with a firm security guarantee. That could be
dangerous and put the United States directly at risk. [Instead, the
United States should increase arms sales to Taiwan and encourage other
countries to do the same.]{.underline}

One of Beijing's top priorities is to cut off Taiwan's access to
sophisticated military hardware. It's working. As late as 1991, some 20
countries supplied Taiwan with arms. Today, the United States is
virtually the only supplier. Israel was once a leading supplier but
stopped in 1992 when it opened diplomatic relations with the PRC. Israel
today is an important supplier of cutting-edge military equipment and
technology ... to China. Germany agreed to stop arms sales to Taiwan in
1993. France, which had sold 60 Mirage fighters to Taiwan, stopped in
1998.

Chinese officials make it clear to countries with arms industries that
"good" relations and lucrative economic ties with the PRC depend upon
those countries' willingness to end military sales to Taiwan. Few
governments contemplate defying Beijing's wishes.

Even the United States has bowed to the pressure. Although the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act obligates Washington to provide Taiwan with
defensive weapons, Washington's performance has been erratic. Indeed, in
the August 1982 U.S.-PRC communique, the Reagan administration promised
to decrease and ultimately eliminate arms sales to Taiwan. American
officials have insisted that the pledge was contingent on Beijing's
commitment to avoid using force to resolve the Taiwan issue. Chinese
leaders interpret the communique provision as an ironclad, unconditional
U.S. pledge to phase out arms shipments.

Washington today is wary of Taipei's arms purchase requests for fear of
angering Beijing. The Clinton administration's decision this year
reflected the timidity. Washington agreed to sell Taiwan a long- range
early warning radar system, advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles
(AMRAAMs), Javelin anti-tank missiles, and Maverick air-to-surface
missiles. But Taiwan didn't get most of these items, including the
centerpiece of its request, the Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyers, as
well as diesel submarines and P-3 Orion patrol aircraft. Indeed, among
the top six items on Taipei's list only one-Maverick missiles-was
approved. Washington did sell AMRAAMs to Taiwan. But the fine print in
the deal says that the missiles stay in America unless Washington
releases them in response to an emergency. In other words: After you're
attacked we'll let you have a weapon to defend yourself.

Such timidity plays into Beijing's strategy to isolate, weaken and
ultimately strangle Taiwan. If Taipei is to deter the PRC from using
coercion on the issue of reunification, Taiwan must be able to purchase
modern armaments, now and in the future.

[Beijing claims that if Taiwan agrees to reunification, the Taiwanese
will be able to retain their government, economic system and military
for an extended period. But this last pledge is meaningless unless
Taiwan has access to modern weapons.]{.underline} Otherwise, the
Taiwanese will be in the same position as Poland in 1939, which had the
best horse cavalry in Europe. That did little good against Nazi Panzer
tanks.

This does not mean that Washington should approve every request.
Taipei's desire for diesel submarines, for instance, seems ill advised
and a waste of money. (Taiwan's military would be better off increasing
the number of P-3 aircraft for anti-submarine missions in its next
request.) But U.S. officials should approve most weapons systems Taiwan
seeks and stop worrying about whether such actions will annoy Beijing.
As far as the PRC is concerned, any arms sale to Taiwan is unacceptable.

[In its own self interest, Washington should be more open to Taiwan's
arms requests. A well-armed Taiwan is better able to deter Beijing from
contemplating the use of force to achieve reunification. Conversely, a
Taiwan armed only with obsolete weaponry may prove an irresistible
temptation to hardliners in Beijing. An effective Taiwanese deterrent
makes it less likely that the United States will ever be called on to
rescue Taiwan. That is definitely in America's best
interest.]{.underline}

[The Trump administration is nearing completion of a]{.underline} new
\"Buy American\" [plan that calls]{.underline} for U.S. military
attaches and diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in
business overseas for the American weapons industry, [going beyond the
assistance they currently provide]{.underline}, U.S. officials said.

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} as early as February [is
expected]{.underline} to announce a \"whole of government\" effort [to
ease export rules on purchases by foreign countries of U.S.-made
military equipment]{.underline}, from fighter jets and drones to
warships and artillery, according to people familiar with the plan.

Trump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign promise to create
jobs in the United States by selling more goods and services abroad to
bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year high of \$50 billion.

The administration is also under pressure from U.S. defense contractors
facing growing competition from foreign rivals such as China and Russia.
But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in
defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was
too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East
and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks.

Besides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches
already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said [another thrust of
the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of]{.underline} the
International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central
policy [governing arms exports]{.underline} since 1976 and has not been
fully revamped in more than three decades.

This expanded government effort on behalf of American arms makers,
together with looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable
treatment of sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring
additional billions of dollars in deals and more jobs, a senior U.S.
official said, without providing specifics.

The strategy of [having the Pentagon]{.underline} and the U.S. State
Department [take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals
could]{.underline} especially [benefit]{.underline} major [defense
contractors]{.underline} such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co.

\"We want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches,

deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

base]{.underline} and will provide more good jobs for American
workers.\"

The White House and Pentagon declined official comment.

Defense industry officials and lobbyists have privately welcomed what
they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach.

It is unclear how deeply the diplomats and military officers overseas
will delve into dealmaking and what guidelines will be established, said
officials in the administration.

[Trump]{.underline}, a Republican, [has the]{.underline} legal
[authority to direct]{.underline} government embassy \"security
[assistance officers]{.underline},\" both military personnel and
civilians, to do more [to]{.underline} help [drive arms
sales.]{.underline}

Administration officials see this group, which already has duties such
as managing military aid overseas and providing information to foreign
governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous
presidents.

One national security analyst said that easing export restrictions to
allow defense contractors to reap greater profits internationally would
increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments
with poor human rights records or being used by militants.

\"This administration has demonstrated from the very beginning that
human rights have taken a back seat to economic concerns,\" said Rachel
Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson
Center in Washington. \"And the short-sightedness of a new arms export
policy could have serious long-term implications.\"

The administration officials said human rights considerations would
remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such
reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal
would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America\'s defense
industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly.

Rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and
compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also
expected to be in the Trump plan, officials said.

Trump\'s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also sought to make it
easier to sell to America\'s most trusted allies but in a more cautious
approach that his administration billed as a way to boost American
business while keeping strict controls against more dangerous arms
proliferation. Foreign weapons sales soared during his tenure, with the
United States retaining its position as the world\'s top arms supplier.

Shares of the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed,
Boeing, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp and Northrop Grumman have
more than tripled over the last five years and currently trade at or
near all-time highs.

[Foreign military sales]{.underline} in fiscal 2017, comprising much of
Trump\'s first year in office and the final months of Obama\'s term,
[climbed to \$42 billion, compared to \$31 billion]{.underline} in the
prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [has]{.underline} already [moved
forward on]{.underline} several controversial [sales]{.underline}. Those
include a push for \$7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi
Arabia despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the
Saudi campaign in Yemen\'s civil war and the unblocking of \$3 billion
in arms to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns
under Obama.

Similar concerns have been raised over the administration\'s
preparations to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small
arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers.

A draft of the new policy proposals recently finished by inter-agency
teams coordinated by Trump\'s National Security Council must now be
approved by a select group of senior cabinet members before being sent
to his desk, the government sources said.

Once Trump announces an extensive framework of the plan, there will be a
60-day public comment period. After that, [the administration is
expected to unveil further details]{.underline}. Some of the changes are
expected to take the form of what is formally known as a presidential
\"National Security Decision Directive,\" two of the sources said.

and close economic relations with, an autonomous [Taiwan]{.underline}.
For instance, **[the U.S. defense industry profits from, and so
encourages, Taiwan's weapons procurement]{.underline}**. Diplomats, the

Taiwan defend itself, strengthen morale among Taiwan's population, deter
Beijing, insure Taipei has the confidence to negotiate with China, and
that---if talks go wrong---Taiwan could fight until U.S. forces arrived.

providing a \$4 billion contract and 5,800 jobs to General Dynamics'
operations in Texas.7 In 2011, a bipartisan group of [45 U.S. senators

//Haus

[US defense]{.underline} strategy [requires]{.underline} an
[improvement]{.underline} in its security assistance program to
adequately empower allies [and partners to]{.underline} provide for
their own security and to [support the US defense-industrial
base]{.underline}. A struggling global economy and shrinking defense
budgets, however, may hamper such efforts. Allies and partners struggle
in their attempt at spending adequate amounts on defense, and US budget
reductions may reduce America's defense spending, thus curtailing
foreign military aid and revenues available to US defense contractors.
[Without adequate levels of revenue, the already brittle defense-
industrial base may be incapable of developing technologies and offering
the American military the best capabilities in the future.]{.underline}

Ultimately, major reductions in defense spending will lead suppliers, as
well as research and development projects, to fall by the wayside. An
"American Way of War" that has utilized technology to offset
quantitative advantages of our opponents may not be sustainable.2
Accordingly, [with a limited defense budget, the United States needs to
find new ways to simultaneously provide for national security, while
maintaining its industrial base.]{.underline} Improved security
assistance will be a key pillar of this effort. Without significant
reforms that increase US responsiveness and competitiveness in the
global defense market, efforts to innovate will be impacted.
Fortunately, [the United States can improve the existing security
assistance apparatus by reforming export controls]{.underline}, updating
legislation, expanding financing programs, and developing a dedicated
security assistance workforce.

The Value of Security Assistance

Security assistance is a form of security cooperation that contains
programs through which the United States provides defense articles and
services to international organizations and foreign governments in
support of US policies and objectives. Although usually administered by
the Department of Defense (DOD), specifically the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA), these programs are legally under the control
of the Department of State. Major security assistance categories include
Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), and
International Military Education and Training. Through the FMS process,
the US government procures defense articles, services, and training on
behalf of the foreign customer country, under the auspices of the DSCA.
Sizable sales also occur through the DCS process between a foreign
country and a US contractor.

The strategic rationale for increased security [assistance]{.underline}
is two-fold: it empowers regional partners and allies, and it [sustains
the defense-industrial base through increased US exports]{.underline}.
US efforts during the Second World War and the US security architecture
throughout the Cold War utilized security assistance funding to bolster
the defenses of regional allies against the spread of fascism and
communism. Although the Cold War has ended, [US support of strategic
"strong points" continues as an economical means to check power
imbalances among countries and counter state instability.]{.underline}

Although security assistance consists of much more than arms sales, [the
transfer of major weapons systems does permit the United States to
access and influence various nations.]{.underline} For example, [a
nation will]{.underline} not simply buy a squadron of F-16 fighters. It
will [send its pilots to the United States for training, bring in US
contractors to conduct maintenance and logistics activities, and engage
in a strategic dialogue with the United States on the employment of
assets]{.underline}. Common technology and materiel builds similar
Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), [promoting interoperability with
nations that may later become coalition partners]{.underline}. Thus
[arms]{.underline} contracts are not only an end to themselves but also
[serve as a means to develop a relationship with a particular
nation]{.underline}. Indeed, foreign [countries]{.underline} often
relish the chance to [procure American technology and equipment
beyond]{.underline} the [obvious material benefits, leveraging the
experience and geopolitical strength of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is a potential asset for their own national
security.]{.underline}

Additionally[, security assistance activities build relationships
between the United States and partner militaries in a way other
activities often do not.]{.underline} As last year's events in Egypt
demonstrated, the professional relationship between militaries can open
avenues of communication necessary for the United States to fully
comprehend a situation, exercise its foreign policy, and promote peace
and stability in what otherwise may be a chaotic situation.

The persistence of counterterror and counterinsurgency campaigns over
the past decade reinforces the value of access to theaters that security
assistance enables.

These campaigns also highlight the extended duration of these types of
conflicts and the associated political and financial costs. In the
future, [America will need to maximize the ability of]{.underline}
national [governments to handle crises]{.underline} and conflicts
[without direct US involvement. Building a partner's capacity to
undertake operations]{.underline} is a cost-effective matter that
[addresses their own security challenges while reducing the prospect of
US military action]{.underline}, and heightens the likelihood of saving
blood and treasure for all concerned. This approach has succeeded in the
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and a host of other countries.

[The challenging fiscal environment]{.underline} the United States is
facing [will accentuate these trends]{.underline}, pushing the United
States to encourage other states to spend more on defense. The fiscal
challenges of allies and partner states will, however, also
simultaneously reduce available defense revenues. For example, NATO
Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen worryingly pointed out in 2011
how "over the past two years defense spending by NATO's European member
nations has shrunk by some 45 billion dollars---that is the equivalent
of Germany's entire annual defense budget."3 The United States' fiscal
situation will likely reduce the level of US funding available to other
nations. Proposals to simply increase the amount spent on security
assistance will not resonate well either within the Pentagon or on
Capitol Hill. Consequently, the existing US security assistance
apparatus will need to become more capable and efficient.

[Another motivating factor for improving security assistance is the
continued success of the US defense-industrial base. Without a strong
industrial base, bolstered by]{.underline} international [transfers,
prices of US acquisitions could increase]{.underline} at a time [when
other nation's]{.underline} defense [budgets are falling. Decreased US
defense spending will aggravate market deviations already prevalent in
the]{.underline} relatively closed and single-buyer, or monopolistic,
[arms industry]{.underline}. Throughout various defense sectors,
[few]{.underline} major prime [contractors are capable of producing key
products, hampering competition]{.underline}. [The situation
is]{.underline} even more [perilous among]{.underline} subcomponent
[manufacturers]{.underline}. For example, in the precision guided
munitions sector, Eagle Picher produces almost all thermal battery
units; Honeywell produces Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); and Rockwell
Collins produces Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. All three
are primarily the sole-source suppliers of Raytheon, Lockheed Martin,
and Boeing.4 Another example can be seen in the world of mine warfare
where the Navy's Mk71 Naval Quickstrike Mines program has faltered as
the only company manufacturing a component of the Target Detection
Device went out of business. [Further]{.underline} defense
[cuts]{.underline}, absent compensating offsets, [could significantly
affect the industry]{.underline}. [Critics might argue defense
cuts]{.underline} will [stabilize the market]{.underline} and rectify
market errors. In doing so, however, [they assume the]{.underline}
defense [industry is a]{.underline} truly [competitive market, which
is]{.underline} certainly [not the case.]{.underline} Rather, [a key
element of sustaining the defense-industrial base will be export sales
as a means for sustaining production]{.underline} lines [and generating
revenues]{.underline} (profits) [necessary for long-term research and
development.]{.underline}

Recognizing these trends, a number of national defense companies around
the globe, particularly in Europe, such as BAE Systems and Fincantierri,
have shifted the majority of their operations abroad, including to the
United States, establishing parallel "home markets." With a number of
major actors in the defense market generally spending less on defense,
international competition will be fierce.

US defense companies have made adjustments. For example, in Boeing's
defense unit foreign sales currently make up 18 percent of its sales,
compared with 7 percent six years ago, and the company has a goal of
boosting this market share to 25 percent within the next five years.5
According to the DSCA, despite fierce competition, US companies are
expected to have sold a record \$46.1 billion in military hardware to
foreign governments in 2011.6 By value, the United States already is the
largest arms exporter in the world, and defense goods and services are
one of the strongest US exports.

Additional [exports will be needed to pick up]{.underline} any [slack
generated by US defense reductions]{.underline}. Also, more exports are
required in an effort to sustain the US strategic advantage in such
areas as aerospace systems. To sustain this US advantage, internal
government and industry procedures require comprehensive reform.

Limits of the Security Assistance Apparatus

The aforementioned demands on security assistance capabilities often
encounter a system that is inadequate to support the task. The current
process is primarily founded on a collection of programs authorized by
the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act of
1976. In the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, Secretary Gates said the
existing system is "constrained by a complex patchwork of authorities,
persistent shortfalls in resources, unwieldy processes, and a limited
ability to sustain such undertakings beyond a short period." In the 2011
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Guidance, Admiral Mullen stated
the current process is outdated, cumbersome, top-heavy, and adversely
affects US military posture.7

Not every aspect of the security assistance system needs reform, but
certain outdated elements and sclerotic bureaucratic processes have left
the United States lagging behind other nations. Secretary of Defense
Gates wrote that other countries have been "more quickly funding
projects, selling weapons, and building relationships."8

Over the last decade, the United States attempted to improve its
security assistance capabilities in response to overseas contingency
operations. Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006, as amended and regularly extended, provides
the Secretary of Defense, through requests by Combatant Commanders, with
authority to train and equip foreign military forces for two specified
purposes: counterterrorism and stability operations, and foreign
maritime security forces for counterterrorism operations. Funds need to
receive the concurrence of the Secretary of State. For fiscal year 2010,
the United States dedicated \$340.6 million to support bilateral
programs in 18 countries and one multilateral program for seven
recipients (including three receiving bilateral aid).9 Congress, thus
far, has refrained from codifying

Section 1206 in permanent law, as requested by DOD. More importantly,
though, the successes in counterterrorism and stability operations aid
dispensation through Section 1206 funding have not translated into
improvements in US Foreign Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales
effectiveness or efficiency, especially with regard to major systems
which could boost the sales. For these reasons, further security
assistance reforms are required.

The Global Perspective

The United States is not the only global provider of defense materiel
and services. Numerous other nations have sophisticated arms industries
that compete with the United States. Some, such as Sweden, have
specialized industries in aerospace or small arms, while others, such as
Russia, compete across a wide spectrum of capabilities. The majority of
these competitors are not military opponents of the United States. Of
the 15 largest arms exporters in the world, nine are allies (Canada,
France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Korea, Netherlands, Spain, and the
United Kingdom) and a further two are close US partners (Sweden and
Switzerland).10 In the future, the United States should pursue
defense-industrial collaboration among allied countries through
mechanisms such as co-development to achieve necessary economies of
scale in research and production. In spite of any future collaboration,
international competition between the United States and its allies will
continue and, in all likelihood, intensify.

Overshadowing this competitive arena is the global economic downturn.
With a few key exceptions among major actors such as China, India, and
Brazil, defense budgets are shrinking. Concomitantly, international
defense-industrial competition remains at an all-time high. The demand
for defense products is generally decreasing while capacity remains
constant. In the current decade, [the United States will need to
compete]{.underline} more intensely for each arms contract [if we are to
enjoy the]{.underline} national security [benefits]{.underline} security
assistance provides.

Defense procurement decisions are not just about capabilities or even
geopolitics; they are also, at their core, business and fiscal
decisions. Restrictions placed on the use of US hardware and total cost
competition can at times reduce the US sales advantage. This is
particularly true in the case of large acquisition projects, such as
aircraft; most countries are unable, or unwilling, to pay exor- bitant
prices upfront. As with any other business venture, sellers offer
financing programs to fund these large-scale projects. The US financing
system, once robust during the Cold War era when there was a strong
political incentive to ensure nations had equipment to ght communism,
atrophied in the 1990s when there was no longer a pressing need to
deliver materiel and technology to counter strategic threats. Now that
the global economy is struggling, access to financing is crucial in
nations faced with fiscal concerns. In certain cases, the initiative
taken by various countries to provide competitive financing makes their
offerings more palatable to national parliaments. This is often the case
even when the militaries want to build a relationship with the United
States. [If the United States does not have the means to make
competitive offers, then it stands at a disadvantage versus
competitors.]{.underline}

defense strong" from Politico.
https://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/for-a-strong-defense-keep-manufacturing-strong-098009

[As the past decade has shown, the United States can be quickly drawn
into conflicts around the world. To be prepared, our country **must
maintain a strong and skilled defense manufacturing industry** to
support the production of the equipment our troops need. But **this
defense base and the skilled jobs it provides are in grave
danger**.]{.underline}

[Between 1998 and 2010, the country lost 57,000 manufacturing facilities
and 6 million manufacturing jobs. If this trend continues, there is a
very real risk that we will **permanently lose the skills** required to
make]{.underline} much-needed [equipment for the]{.underline} U.S.
[military]{.underline} and will need to look overseas for suppliers. As
former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned earlier this year, "[The
last]{.underline} damn [thing we need if we face a crisis is
to]{.underline} somehow [contract out that responsibility to another
country. So **we have to maintain the core industrial base that we need.
The skills are essential to our ability to maintain a strong national
defense**."]{.underline}

A prime example of this danger to both our economy and national security
is the threatened shutdown of the Bradley Industrial Base, consisting of
the York, Pa., facility where BAE Systems manufactures the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle and the suppliers that support the program. Built to
protect and transport troops, the armored vehicle is the workhorse of
the U.S. Army and the embodiment of American defense industrial base
know-how and engineering: The vehicle's advanced aluminum armor and
weapons systems are produced by 7,000 skilled workers in 586 businesses
across 44 states.

Now, in an attempt to modernize the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the Army
is shifting funding away from Bradley Industrial Base, which in turn
will force a closure of the base's production and supply chain as early
as 2014 and lasting at least three years. With production halted, the
businesses that make up the Bradley Industrial Base will be unable to
employ the highly skilled workers who produce the specialized parts that
keep these vehicles running. [Thousands of workers will **lose their
jobs** and some will move on to other fields, while their **skills** ---
unique to building combat vehicles --- will become **lost or obsolete**.
As a result, our armed forces may end up going into harm's way **without
equipment manufactured** in America and ready for today's
battlefield.]{.underline}

[Since World War II, our military --- and all Americans --- have relied
on a **highly skilled, dedicated and engaged civilian defense labor
force of engineers, designers, welders, electricians, machinists and
pipe fitters**]{.underline}. Like a well-prepared combat team, [this
labor force --- nearly 625,000 people --- is continuously training in
order to maintain their **technological superiority**. As new
technologies are developed to address the **ever-changing threats** from
our enemy, this labor force acquires new skills to **keep pace and meet
the military's needs**]{.underline}. Now [these workers, the products
they make, the incomes their families and communities depend on and
America's ability to defend itself are all **at risk.**]{.underline}

As a nation, we must make it a priority to ensure the strength of the
Army's combat vehicle program and the skilled defense industrial base
jobs that support this crucial capability. The Army can help the Bradley
Industrial Base in the near term simply by spending the \$288 million
provided last year to allow industry to perform its requirements, which
ensure that older vehicles are upgraded with the latest technology our
troops need. In the longer term, [the Army should work with industry to
ensure that our troops can meet the missions they might face, while
providing industry with the stability to sustain the skilled jobs needed
to respond to future threats.]{.underline}

[Dwindling budgets]{.underline} and the desire for short-term financial
gains [are threatening America's "arsenal of democracy" and with it our
economy]{.underline}. The skilled men and women of the defense
manufacturing industry do work that allows us to fly the red, white and
blue, and they must not be pink-slipped. [Equipping our military is too
important to outsource --- our economy, our national security and our
fellow Americans count on it.]{.underline}

#### American growth and leadership solve war -- the alternative is power vacuum conflicts 

**Haass 13** Richard N. Haass, President of the Council on Foreign
Relations, previously served as Director of Policy Planning for the US
State Department The World Without America
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/repairing-the-roots-of-american-power-by-richard-n\--haass

NEW YORK -- Let me posit a radical idea: The most critical threat facing
the United States now and for the foreseeable future is not a rising
China, a reckless North Korea, a nuclear Iran, modern terrorism, or
climate change. Although all of these constitute potential or actual
threats, [the biggest challenges facing the US are its]{.underline}
burgeoning debt, crumbling infrastructure, second-rate primary and
secondary schools, outdated immigration system, and [slow **economic
growth** -- in short, the domestic foundations of American
power.]{.underline}

Readers in other countries may be tempted to react to this judgment with
a dose of schadenfreude, finding more than a little satisfaction in
America's difficulties. Such a response should not be surprising. The US
and those representing it have been guilty of hubris (the US may often
be the indispensable nation, but it would be better if others pointed
this out), and examples of inconsistency between America's practices and
its principles understandably provoke charges of hypocrisy. When America
does not adhere to the principles that it preaches to others, it breeds
resentment.

But, like most temptations, [the urge to gloat at America's
imperfections and struggles ought to be resisted. People around the
globe should be careful what they wish for. America's failure to deal
with its internal challenges would **come at a steep
price**]{.underline}. Indeed**[, the rest of the world's stake in
American success is nearly as large as that of the US
itself.]{.underline}**

Part of the reason is economic. The US economy still accounts for about
one-quarter of global output. [If US growth accelerates, America's
capacity to consume other countries' goods and services will increase,
thereby **boosting growth around the world**]{.underline}. At a time
when Europe is drifting and Asia is slowing, [only the US]{.underline}
(or, more broadly, North America) [has the potential to drive **global
economic recovery**]{.underline}.

[The US remains a unique source of innovation]{.underline}. Most of the
world's citizens communicate with mobile devices based on technology
developed in Silicon Valley; likewise, the Internet was made in America.
More recently, [new technologies developed in the US greatly increase
the ability to extract **oil and natural gas** from underground
formations. This technology is now making its way around the globe,
allowing other societies to increase their **energy production and
decrease both their reliance on costly imports and their carbon
emissions**.]{.underline}

[The US is also an invaluable source of ideas]{.underline}. Its
world-class universities educate a significant percentage of future
world leaders. More fundamentally, the US has long been a leading
example of what market economies and democratic politics can accomplish.
People and governments around the world are far more likely to become
more open if the American model is perceived to be succeeding.

Finally, [the world faces many serious challenges, ranging from the need
to halt the **spread of weapons of mass destruction, fight climate
change, and maintain a functioning world economic order that promotes
trade and investment to regulating practices in cyberspace, improving
global health, and preventing armed conflicts**. These problems will not
simply go away or sort themselves out.]{.underline}

While Adam Smith's "invisible hand" may ensure the success of free
markets, it is powerless in the world of geopolitics. [Order requires
the visible hand of **leadership** to formulate and realize global
**responses to global challenges**.]{.underline}

Don't get me wrong: None of this is meant to suggest that the US can
deal effectively with the world's problems on its own. Unilateralism
rarely works. It is not just that the US lacks the means; the very
nature of contemporary global problems suggests that only collective
responses stand a good chance of succeeding.

But [multilateralism is much easier to advocate than to design and
implement. Right now **there is only one candidate for this role: the
US**. No other country has the necessary combination of capability and
outlook]{.underline}.

This brings me back to the argument that **[the US must put its house in
order]{.underline}** -- economically, physically, socially, and
politically -- [if it is to have the resources needed to promote order
in the world. Everyone should hope that it does: The alternative to a
world led by the US is not a world led by China, Europe, Russia, Japan,
India, or any other country, but rather **a world that is not led at
all. Such a world would almost certainly be characterized by chronic
crisis and conflict**]{.underline}. That would be bad not just for
Americans, but for the vast majority of the planet's inhabitants.

#### Arms sales increasing -- sustains the DIB and solves a laundry list of impacts

**Thompson 18** (Loren Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of Lexington
Institute, Apr 20, 2018, \"Trump Drone Decree Signals Arms Exports Are
Now A Key Feature Of U.S. Economic Policy,\" Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2018/04/20/trump-drone-decree-signals-arms-exports-are-now-a-key-feature-of-u-s-economic-policy/#b2f560f32a56//KDES).

Donald [Trump is turning out to be the best thing to happen to the
defense industry since Ronald Reagan left town. On Thursday of this
week, the White House released a presidential memorandum loosening the
restrictions on overseas sales of unmanned aerial vehicles, colloquially
known as \"drones.\" Defense companies have been arguing for years that
regulations concerning the export of drones were too burdensome, and
enabled competitors to capture foreign markets.]{.underline}

Clearly, the White House has heard these complaints.

But [the implications]{.underline} of the April 19 memorandum
[are]{.underline} far more [momentous]{.underline}, because [it commits
the federal government to actively facilitating arms sales to overseas
allies and partners. The government has always been a participant in
decisions to export weapons, but now it looks poised to become a
promoter]{.underline}. The memorandum cites several reasons why this is
desirable: [it creates jobs, it reduces the trade deficit, it spurs
innovation, it maintains our military\'s warfighting edge, and it
reduces the need for other countries to seek U.S. \"boots on the
ground.\"]{.underline}

The Obama administration would have agreed in principle with many of
these objectives. In practice, though, [its baroque process for
reviewing proposed arms transfers often impeded the ability of U.S.
defense companies to compete in places like the Persian Gulf, and in the
case of unmanned aerial vehicles, it enabled China to seize a large
share of the global market.]{.underline}

Trump\'s memorandum won\'t open the floodgates to arms sales \--
Congress will still play a critical role in approving major transactions
\-- but [as the new policy is implemented weapons sales to other
countries are nearly certain to increase, and that is good news for the
defense industry. Some companies such as Boeing, General Atomics,
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Textron are positioned to reap significant
sales gains]{.underline} (I have financial ties of one sort or another
to most of these companies).

But there is more to this story than the loosening of curbs on arms
exports. Military production is getting wrapped into a broader White
House industrial policy aimed at revitalizing the entire U.S.
manufacturing base. The administration is about to release the results
of a year-long investigation into the health of the defense industrial
base, and it has included in its expansive definition of that sector
many basic industries that contribute production inputs to military
items.

To a far greater degree than any previous administration,
[the]{.underline} Trump [White House sees the defense industry as an
integral part of the overall industrial economy and a tool through which
it can bolster the health of struggling sectors such as steel and
aluminum.]{.underline} The traditional view of military contractors in
both Republican and Democratic administrations has been that they are a
unique and separate part of the economy \-- one requiring special
handling \-- but President Trump apparently favors a different approach.

In Trump\'s conception, Washington can get a lot more mileage out of its
defense dollars if it consciously includes economic and trade
considerations in its spending practices. The Pentagon is the world\'s
biggest purchaser of advanced technology and accounts for a significant
share of all domestic manufacturing jobs, so to Trump it is just common
sense that defense and economic policies should be viewed as different
facets of a unified agenda.

The Trump approach may seem novel in an American context, but it is
actually the way that most countries \-- including Russia and China \--
deal with their defense industries. Few nations have the luxury of
segregating their military producers from the rest of the economy, and
making purchases without regard to the potential economic and trade
fallout. So the Trump strategy actually aligns Washington with the way
most of our allies and adversaries think about military production and
arms exports.

Thursday\'s memorandum makes it clear that the U.S. will not be selling
weapons indiscriminately to all comers. Proposed transactions will still
be reviewed to ascertain that they are compatible with U.S. security
objectives. But the amount of time required will be greatly compressed
from what it was, and [the volume of arms exports will likely grow
significantly. So if you thought things couldn\'t get any better for the
U.S. defense industry, guess again. They just did.]{.underline}

#### Trump has relaxed regulations and increased arms sales by drastic numbers

**Cohen 18 --** Zachary, CNN correspondent specializing in breaking news
and the national security beat. "Trump administration touts 33% increase
in foreign arms sales,"
<https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/trump-administration-foreign-arms-sales-2018/index.html>

[US foreign military sales totaled \$55.66 billion in 2018, a 33%
increase compared to the nearly \$42 billion in weapons sold in
2017]{.underline}, the Defense Cooperation Agency announced Wednesday.

[It is the highest annual total for military sales to foreign
governments since 2012 when the US conducted upwards of \$69 billion in
arms deals]{.underline} with allies and partners around the world.

[The upward trend is due]{.underline}, in part, [to the Trump
administration\'s push to relax restrictions on foreign military
sales]{.underline}. Though critics suggest human rights concerns are
being relegated in the rush to increase sales.

Since taking office, President Donald [Trump has demonstrated an
insatiable appetite for selling American weaponry abroad]{.underline}
\-- at times using face-to-face meetings with foreign leaders to make a
personal sales pitch.

[Trump signed a nearly \$110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia\'s
King]{.underline} Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in May [last
year]{.underline} in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on what was his first
stop abroad as President.

In the same month, [the US government reauthorized the export of Paveway
munitions to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, ending Obama\'s December 2016
ban.

[He has also encouraged US officials to take on a more active role in
facilitating foreign military sales abroad in order to increase business
for the US weapons industry]{.underline}.

[How Trump plans to arm the world with US
weapons](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/politics/trump-us-arms-sales-policy/index.html)

In April, [the administration rolled out its \"Buy American\" plan to
lift]{.underline} \-- what it views \-- as [self-imposed policy
restrictions that limit potential opportunities for
business]{.underline}.

\"[These policy changes advance US national security and foreign policy
because they make FMS more attractive in a very competitive
market]{.underline},\" DSCA Director LTG Charles W. Hooper said in a
statement on Wednesday.

\"The United States not only sells the world\'s most state-of-the-art
defense systems, but [we also strengthen our alliances and attract new
partners through enduring strategic and defense
partnership,\"]{.underline} he added.

[Under the Trump administratio]{.underline}n\'s Conventional Arms
Transfer (CAT) policy and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) export policy,
[private US defense companies are allowed to directly sell some types of
conventional weapons]{.underline} and a broader range of unmanned drones
to allies without having to go through the US government.

\"[The organizational culture of the Trump administration is \'Buy
American. Hire American]{.underline}.\' These are the two simple rules
that President Trump has repeatedly stressed,\" Dr. Peter Navarro,
assistant to the President for trade and manufacturing policy and
director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy,
told reporters when the policy was unveiled.

[Under this policy, DSCA says it has been able to reduce the cost of
doing business with the US government through Foreign Military Sales and
streamlined the transfer process]{.underline}.

[Taiwan will continue to buy arms from the United States with its
purchases boosting employment in at least six U.S. states]{.underline}
and narrowing the bilateral trade gap, the government has told the
United States, in rare public comment sure to anger China, which claims
the island as its own.

[Taiwan's military purchases "have boosted the local economy of and
employment in states such as Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Utah, Ohio and
Pennsylvania,"]{.underline} the government said as part of the public
comment process for a 90-day trade review being conducted by the United
States.

Companies like Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Co, Boeing Co, Sikorsky and
BAE Systems PLC have benefited from Taiwan's purchases of missile
defense systems, attack helicopters, fighter jets, and other amphibious
assault vehicles, it said.

[Taiwan]{.underline} said that despite its own efforts to build up an
indigenous defense, "this will not affect our military procurement from
the U.S." and that it [would continue to procure goods, including
military hardware.]{.underline}

Taiwan and the United States usually keep a low profile on their
military exchanges because it angers Beijing, which has never renounced
the use of force to bring the island under its control.

The United States is the island's biggest political ally and is
obligated under U.S. law to help Taiwan defend itself.

indispensable." June 27, 19.
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/27/amid-budget-talks-remember-that-americas-defense-industrial-base-is-indispensable/

As Congress takes up the annual defense budget, it is worth
acknowledging the comfort and quality of life to which we are accustomed
owes its legacy in no small part to the collaborative force of the
[greatest public-private partnership in American history: the
defense-industrial base]{.underline}.

Those who would downplay this partnership may not fully grasp the extent
to which the U.S. has benefited immeasurably beyond its immediate
national security needs. From safe and reliable commercial aviation, to
cancer research and treatment, to the internet itself, the [innovation
that has supported our military]{.underline} over the decades have
[simultaneously enhanced the lives of all Americans]{.underline}.

The advantages accrued by the nation's investment in technology have not
always been readily apparent, and the relationship has not always been
easy or straightforward. The U.S. military often has to create an
industrial capability where once there was none.

Fortunately, the DNA of the [commercial technology sector is directly
intertwined into our]{.underline} robust and diverse [defense-industrial
base.]{.underline} Influencing current innovation ranging from satellite
telecommunication to hybrid vehicles, Silicon Valley itself and
countless university labs owe their founding to defense investment
grants and contracts.

Beyond the qualitative measures of these standout technologies, the
[defense-industrial base supports]{.underline} one of the [largest
high-skill and high-wage workforces in the nation.]{.underline} Indeed,
the [U.S. defense]{.underline} and aerospace industry [employs 2.4
million workers]{.underline} with an average salary 44 percent above the
national average.

Despite antiquated procurement practices imposed by Congress and
successive administrations, today's industrial base is flexible and
resilient and able to meet every U.S. military requirement without fail.
By every measure, that is success.

But as the late Sen. John McCain cautioned at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in 2015, global research and development is more than twice
that of the United States, and Chinese R&D levels are projected to
surpass the United States by 2022.

As recently noted in the context of U.S. space dominance being under
challenge by foreign competitors, we must unharness American ingenuity
and allow industry to develop and deploy innovation at increasing speed
and efficiency.

No different than other industrial sectors, defense companies
reorganized and internally reformed over the past few decades. Today,
America's top defense suppliers zealously manage their own compliance
and contract performance, rather than relying on government procurement
officers to oversee product development milestones and service delivery.

As legislative and executive branch policymakers resolve budget
differences over the coming months, it is worth recognizing the broad
and diffused impact of such deliberations over the years. [From the
convenience of weather data and digital photography to omnipresent
mobile communications, the innovation of our defense-industrial base has
delivered for all Americans.]{.underline}

**Navarro, 3-19-19** (Peter Navarro, an assistant to the president and
the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. "Why
America needs a stronger defense industry", New York Times) //GB

In terms of economic security, the [Trump defense budget is helping to
create good manufacturing jobs at good wages, including in communities
like Lima that have fallen behind economically.]{.underline} The
revitalized Lima plant will directly employ a little more than 1,000
employees. [And plants like the one in Lima are drivers for thousands of
more jobs in the supply chain across the country]{.underline}.

Consider, for example, the ripple effects of the Lima plant. In Ohio
alone, 198 of its suppliers are spread out across the state's 16
congressional districts. These mostly small and medium-size businesses
churn out components ranging from bearings, castings and industrial
packaging to electronic assemblies, pressure gauges and steel. [The
impact is not limited to Ohio]{.underline}. Honeywell
[manufactures]{.underline} the Abrams engine [in Alabama]{.underline},
Allison manufactures its transmissions in I[ndiana]{.underline}, the
tank's main gun is made at the Watervliet Arsenal in [New
York]{.underline}, special armor comes from the Idaho National
Laboratory, [and]{.underline} the gun tube preforms come
from Ellwood [in Pennsylvania.]{.underline}

[In terms of national security, state of the art tanks like the latest
versions of the Abrams are critical tools in increasing the
effectiveness of American ground forces, enabling the decisive defeat of
the threats outlined in our National Security]{.underline} Strategy and
National Defense Strategy. A less obvious, but no less important,
benefit comes from sharing these upgraded combat vehicle capacities with
our allies and strategic partners through conventional arms sales.

In the Middle East, Kuwait's tank fleet consists of 218 Abrams tanks,
and its military is planning to double that number. Saudi Arabia has 374
recently upgraded Abrams tanks, while Egypt has the largest fleet, at
1,130. Australia commands a fleet of 59 Abrams tanks and may order 100
more. Taiwan may soon buy 108 Abrams tanks as well. [Those arms sales
not only help create good jobs at good wages in America]{.underline} ---
a principle not well understood by the Obama administration --- [they
also enhance America's capacity to bolster and stabilize our regional
alliances]{.underline}, even as they may reduce the need to deploy more
American soldiers overseas.

Association, organization that advocates for policies and investments

Industries Association) //GB

The [defense industrial base is a national strategic asset that has
provided the United States with a marked advantage in defense technology
for more than six decades.]{.underline} But that asset --- the
intellectual capital and production capacity of aerospace and defense
manufacturing --- is at risk of atrophying to a point where it will not
be able to provide the weapons systems this country needs in the future.
[In aggregate, there are simply not enough viable modernization programs
and platforms --- in shipbuilding, manned aircraft, combat vehicles, and
more --- in or near production to meet the warfighter needs based on our
global national security strategy.]{.underline} Furthermore, in an era
of flattening and declining defense budgets, industry leaders receive
little useful guidance from the Pentagon that would allow them to best
target investments in people, facilities, and technology based on our
military's future needs. Continuing along this path portends several
risks:

[A growing number of corporations may shed their defense business
because their management will conclude that the growing risk and
declining returns associated with defense programs are fundamentally
incompatib]{.underline}le with their fiduciary responsibilities.

The [defense workforce will continue to erode as a generation of
technicians, engineers, and scientists retires and the dearth of new
programs makes it difficult to attract a new generation of
engineering]{.underline} and scientific talent. [Thousands of
high-skilled, middle-class jobs will be lost to an industry that is one
of the few manufacturing sectors left where the U.S. is globally
competitive.]{.underline}

Consequently, [if a shift in the global security dynamic requires the
production of new weapons, industry would have a difficult time
reconstituting much of its skilled work force and production
capacity]{.underline}, with a potentially steep cost in time and
resources.

(CB)

[America's military must always be capable of going to war this very day
with capabilities on which warfighters can rely]{.underline}, with which
they have trained, and for which they have the necessary sustainment. At
the same time, the [military needs to prepare for future conflicts, to
modernize, in anticipation of or in response to changes in threats and
technology]{.underline}, seeking capabilities that will be needed in the
event of future fights. Finally, [the military must ensure that there is
sufficient resilience and adaptability in the defense industrial base to
respond to unanticipated circumstances and emerging needs, particularly
in wartime.]{.underline}

[Modernization is one of the four pillars on which U.S. military power
rests]{.underline}, along with force structure, readiness, and
sustainability. The goals of modernization are to close a capability
gap, provide a qualitatively improved capability, and/or reduce costs.
Modernization entails the replacement of an existing military
technology, generally a platform, weapon, or system, with one that is
significantly more capable, even transformational. Modernization is
about more than just hardware. To achieve a significant increase in
military effectiveness, the new item must be married to an appropriate
organization, concept of operations, set of tactics, command and control
system, and supporting infrastructure.

#### Collapses hegemony - decrease in D.I.B support would threaten U.S economy and national security leaks over into other security sectors

**Interagency Task Force September 2018** ( task force found to
investigate DIB, Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and
Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United
States)

[The roots of America's defense industrial base are planted in the
broader manufacturing ecosystem.]{.underline} [Not only is the
manufacturing sector the backbone of U.S. military technical advantage,
but also a major contributor to the U.S economy]{.underline}, accounting
for 9% of employment, 12% of GDP, 60% of exports, 55% of patents, and
70% of U.S. R&D.24 [The National Security Strategy highlights the
importance of a vibrant manufacturing sector to comprehensive national
power, while warning of the dangers inherent in the weakening of
America's manufacturing base: A healthy defense industrial base is a
critical element of U.S. power and the National Security Innovation
Base]{.underline}. [The ability of the military to surge in response to
an emergency depends on our Nation's ability to produce needed parts and
systems, healthy and secure supply chains, and a skilled U.S.
workforce]{.underline}. [The erosion of American manufacturing over the
last two decades, however, has had a negative impact on these
capabilities and threatens to undermine the ability of U.S.
manufacturers to meet national security requirements.]{.underline}
Today, we rely on single domestic sources for some products and foreign
supply chains for others, and we face the possibility of not being able
to produce specialized components for the military at home[. As
America's manufacturing base has weakened, so too have critical
workforce skills ranging from industrial welding, to high-technology
skills for cybersecurity and aerospace. Support for a vibrant domestic
manufacturing sector, a solid defense industrial base, and resilient
supply chains is a national priority]{.underline}.25Between 2000 and
2010, over two-thirds of U.S. manufacturing saw production declines in
terms of inflation-adjusted output.26 [While multi-factor productivity
in manufacturing grew on an average of 2% per year from 1992-2004,
productivity has declined an average of 0.3% per year from 2004 through
2016]{.underline}, implying diminishing economies of scale from inputs
including labor, capital equipment, energy, materials, and purchased
services.[27 Between 2000 and 2010 alone, the U.S. lost over 66,000
manufacturing facilities.28 While the U.S. has seen an uptick in
manufacturing, adding around 380,000 jobs since January 2017, 29 much
work remains to be done to remedy years of decline in the
sector.]{.underline} From 2000-2018, many defense-relevant sectors have
seen increased import penetration with rates more than doubling for the
industrial controls and machine tools subsectors.[30 Since 2010,
critical manufacturing and defense industrial base areas have seen
fluctuations in obligations spending, creating variability in vendor
counts and in many cases leading to lower domestic competition and
further deteriorating DoD's supply chain]{.underline} (Figure 11). [The
negative effects of sequestration and the budget caps shocked the market
and accelerated the downward trend in vendor counts, resulting in an
estimated 20% decline in the number of prime
vendors]{.underline}.[31Although America's traditional manufacturing
base still accounts for an outsized benefit to the economy, decreases in
key production capabilities, declines in manufacturing employment, and
slow output growth for many manufacturing sectors have created key
vulnerabilities and weaknesses that potentially threaten the nation's
defense-related manufacturing capabilities]{.underline}. [Since 1990,
small and medium sized businesses -- which make up a majority of U.S.
manufacturing and employ a large portion of workers in the sector --
reported declines in revenue growth]{.underline}, despite the largest
manufacturing firms posting more than 2% annual growth.32 [The next
generation of weapons will require advanced software, artificial
intelligence, and machine learning, but traditional manufacturing
processes continues to build the systems, platforms, and munitions that
deliver kinetic effects. Both aspects of the industrial base are needed
for long term economic growth and national security. The decline in the
U.S. manufacturing industry, relative to prior periods of great power,
creates a variety of risks for America's manufacturing and defense
industrial base and, by extension, for DoD's ability to support national
defense. Risks range from greater reliance on single sources, sole
sources, and foreign providers to workforce gaps, product insecurity,
and loss of innovation.]{.underline}

unmanned aerial systems is a race for global influence that goes well
beyond the marketplace]{.underline}**, government and industry
association panelists agreed on Wednesday. "Who's going to make the
rules for the next 50 years" for international behavior, Dak Hardwick,
assistant vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace
Industries Association, said. [Hardwick and others specially cited the
growing Chinese interest in overseas military sales and Russia's success
of selling air missile defense systems to Turkey and possibly India.
Neither has the strict rules governing the sales or how these systems
would be used after purchase the U.S. does.]{.underline} [Speaking at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies event in

Kaidanow, acting assistant secretary of state for political-military
affairs, added the April presidential memo revising the arms transfer
policy and covering unmanned serial systems sales, "is only the first
step \[to\] support and grow our defense industrial base." She added
that every sale, still will be reviewed for compliance with United
States law concerning human rights and how each sale could affect arms
proliferation. [The government expects to meet industry requests to set
milestones and timelines so they can plan and budget for potential sales
domestically and to allies and partners,]{.underline} Laura Cressey,
deputy director for regional security and arms transfers at the State
Department said. She added [new financing options for foreign partners
would be available as an incentive to buy American]{.underline}. "We
have a bit of a balancing act here," she said. For example, the
balancing act includes mitigating the risk to the American warfighter
five years down the road by selling this specific system with its unique
technology to "Y" country. Case-by-case also means that approval is not
guaranteed based upon past performance by a contractor or behavior by a
nation, she and several panelists said. In some parts of the State
Department, it also means trying to "do more with less" to meet
accelerated timelines as staffing has been left vacant or cut, she
added. To Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Arms Control
Association, this raised "a great deal of concern" because "priorities
are not being weighted" in reaching those decisions. He added arms sales
should not be considered "a trade commodity; these are weapons," not to
be rushed the system. Arms sales "are fundamentally a political act,"
Melissa Dalton, director of CSIS' cooperative defense project, added,
and the change in policy needs to fit in with the President Donald
Trump's national security strategy. In the memo, she said it uses that
standard as a guide but does not spell out how for the various federal
agencies involved in arms transfers. **["What has changed" most in the
international marketplace "is the United States is not alone" in
offering quality military equipment,]{.underline}** Keith Webster,
president of the defense and aerospace export council at the United
States Chamber of Commerce, said. [He said the United States is not only
competing with the Russians and the Chinese, but also with its allies
such as the French, Koreans and Israelis]{.underline}. Thirty years ago,
"we had a very strong corner on the market," and only serious
competition from the Kremlin. Now the "consequence of denial" in a
potential arms transfer over American concerns about how the system will
be used or a nation's change in behavior, as was the case with Pakistan
when it pursued its nuclear weapons program, have much greater
consequences domestically. Likewise, [it becomes more complicated when a
potential partner, such as India, buys sophisticated aircraft from
France]{.underline}, as New Delhi did, and may do with an air defense
system from Russia. **[Another goal in foreign arms sale is
interoperability]{.underline}** with American forces, Cressey and
Kaidanow said. When systems from other nations, even allies, are in
play, that becomes a further reach. As the policy unfolds, the panelists
from industry and [arms control associations stressed the importance of
keeping businesses and the public involved in as transparent a process
as possible.]{.underline} Alex Gray, a special White House assistant for
the defense industrial base, used the Farnborough air show this year in
the United Kingdom as an example of [the administration reaching out to
all levels of industry and allies and partners to talk over these
changes and what they can mean for them.]{.underline} "This is just the
beginning of our engagement," Cressey said, referring to follow-up
roundtables with industry, think tanks and associations. Hardwick, in
answer to a question, reminded all **[it was important for State, who
gives the formal approval, and the Pentagon and Commerce, both also
involved in the sales program, to "remember the role of the end-user" in
all this. After all, it is an ally or partner looking to provide for its
security needs when examining different systems from a number of
countries.]{.underline}**

### 2nc -- ! -- hegemony 

#### US hegemony prevents great power war 

**Ward 14** (Alex Ward, Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on
International Security on U.S. defense policy and strategy, The
Diplomat, 8-22-2014, \"Only US Can Prevent Great Power War,\" Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2014/08/only-us-can-prevent-great-power-war//KDES).

[As the World War I centennial is celebrated, repressed thoughts of
great power war once again begin to surface. With today's highly
"interconnected global economy" underwritten by a liberal order leading
to the "rise of the rest," it appears unlikely that any state would want
to disrupt the current system]{.underline}. And yet, the constant stream
of somber news reignites fears of a calamitous global catastrophe. In
times of international flux, where the worst seems possible, it is
important to turn to those who can best interpret these eras. In the
case of great power or "hegemonic" wars, there is hardly a greater
authority than Robert Gilpin. In his seminal work on the subject, War
and Change in World Politics, [Gilpin argues that three preconditions
must be met for a hegemonic war to occur. First, Gilpin believes that
the soon-to-be warring parties must feel there is a "'closing in' of
space and opportunities." Second, there must be a general "perception
that a fundamental historical change is taking place." Finally, events
around the world start to "escape human control."]{.underline} Notably,
all three of these conditions currently exist in the world. **[Closing
In]{.underline}** Europe, where great power conflict took place for
centuries, was heavily congested and contested. As powers like Britain,
France, Germany and others rose, they fought for influence and geography
at the expense of the others' territory. Due to the close quarters, any
desire for expansion on one country's part would cause concern in the
others. Today, some say, the world is different. The two powers that
would compete in a war --- the United States and China --- are separated
by a vast ocean, supposedly making it hard for each to antagonize the
other. [This, however, is not true. The map may show an expansive world,
but new technologies --- leading to hyperconnectivity and shorter travel
times, especially for military equipment --- have made the world
"claustrophobic." To wit, when China announced an "Air Defense
Identification Zone" the United States quickly deployed two B-52 bombers
to challenge its claim.]{.underline} And that was using old equipment.
Both China and the United States are developing hypersonic missiles and
vehicles. [Humanity has already conquered physical space with commercial
flight and fast ships. Now, it continues to shrink space even further
for potentially decisive advantage. It is also hard to claim that China
and the United States are far apart when they regularly bump up against
each other as they have in the South China Sea.
**Perception**]{.underline} Since the dawn of "Pax Americana" after
World War II, belief in the United States as the undisputed global
hegemon remained fairly stable. Until now. According to a recent Pew
poll, [Americans' views of the United States as a global power have
reached a 40-year low. Indeed, only 17 percent believe that America
plays a "more important and powerful role than ten years ago." Rightly
or wrongly, this perception exists. Even though most people still find
the United States preferable to China, regional powers can use the
widespread belief that America is declining to make their cases for
running the system. In fact they are already doing so to a degree. For
example, China's Global Times reports that 47 percent of people believe
China has achieved "major power" status. Should both perceptions keep
trending in the same direction --- the United States is declining while
China rises --- then the feeling of an historic shift is almost
inevitable.]{.underline} Human Control As current events prove, [even
the great powers cannot stop horrendous things from happening in the
world.]{.underline} From Latin America and Africa to Eastern Europe, the
Middle East, and East Asia, chaos and turmoil run rampant. While this is
a particularly bad period for international affairs, it is naïve to
think this may be an isolated epoch. In fact, there is reason to think
the world might grow more unstable in the years ahead. Over the next 11
years, the world can expect another one billion people, reaching a total
of around 8 billion by 2030. As technology becomes more powerful, it
will do two things. First, it will empower the individual, or a group of
individuals, to do great good or great harm. Second, it will allow
individuals to be more aware of how the middle class lives. People
around the world will demand similar things, causing stress on
governments and brewing civil unrest and instability. Thus, as people
are further empowered and further angered, the probability that these
non-state actors --- indeed, normal, everyday people --- disrupt
international affairs or geopolitics is high. Governments will continue
to have less and less control of the citizenry, allowing the regular
citizen to do with her newfound power what she wills. In essence, we
will see, in a big way, the diffusion of power. Although the world
currently satisfies Gilpin's three preconditions, there need not be
pessimism. For one, current relations between the United States and
China are nowhere near the point where a potential great war between
them is possible, and there is no other rivalry nearing that of
Washington and Beijing. Second, [some of the trends that can cause harm,
like rapid technological progress, can also be used to help stabilize
the global order. To be sure, technology could be used to curb the
desolation brought on by expectedly low water, food, and energy
levels.]{.underline} Finally, and most importantly, Gilpin's guidance is
certainly not comprehensive. There are more variables for which to
account (i.e. the effect of nuclear weapons) that dictate whether or not
a great power war may take place. That said, Gilpin's framework serves
as a good rubric by which to measure the current global climate. By all
measures, this is certainly a dangerous time. But Gilpin's preconditions
shouldn't be misconstrued as predictive or fatalistic. Indeed, [the
United States, as the hegemon, has the capability (and responsibility)
to preserve the international order and lead the world out of this mess.
By keeping good relations with partners and allies, deterring
adversaries, reversing the perception of its decline, and leveraging
technological capabilities for global good, there is a decent chance
that the U.S. can make the great-power-war-incubation period fade away.
Should the United States not seize this moment, and ensure that China is
a responsible partner in the current global system alongside it, then
the chance of a great power war cannot be dismissed, however
remote.]{.underline}

#### Taiwan assurance is at a 40 year high due to new massive arms deal

China\",

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} tentatively [approved
the sale of \$2 billion in military hardware to Taiwan, demonstrating
support for its]{.mark} unofficial [ally]{.mark}]{.underline} in a move
likely to exacerbate deteriorating ties between Washington and Beijing.
The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, part of the United States
Defense Department, notified Congress of [two proposed arms sales on
Monday. The first notification included 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well
as Hercules armored vehicles and heavy equipment transporters. The
second included more than \$220 million in Stinger antiaircraft
missiles.]{.underline} The tentative approvals come as relations between
the United States and China are already being tested by a trade war and
the decoupling of technology supply chains. [The armaments would provide
Taiwan with greater deterrence capabilities against the growing military
threat from China, experts said.]{.underline} "These tanks and missiles
will provide the Taiwan army with a modern capability to deter and
complicate the operational planning of the People's Liberation Army
forces that coerce and threaten Taiwan," Rupert Hammond-Chambers,
president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, said in a statement on
Monday. "They will also offer new opportunities to engage in cooperation
with the United States in both the deployment and operations phases."
[Lawmakers have 30 days to object to the sale, but they are considered
unlikely to do so.]{.underline} The approvals come as Taiwan's
president, Tsai Ing-wen, prepares for a trip this week to North America,
a visit that could further anger Beijing. The Taiwanese government said
her first stop would be New York. The United States broke formal
diplomatic ties with Taiwan's government in 1979 in order to establish
relations with China's Communist government, which claims the
self-governing island as its territory and has threatened to unify it
with the mainland by force. Shortly after the end of the formal
alliance, along with the American military presence there, [Congress
passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which requires that the United States
provide Taiwan with weapons of a defensive nature to deter an attack
from China. In 1982, the United States broadened its support with a
document known as the Six Assurances, the first of which stated that
Washington would not set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan. Chang
Tun-han, [a spokesman]{.mark} for Ms. Tsai, [welcomed the news of
the]{.mark} tentative [arms sales approvals]{.mark} on Tuesday. "[The
American government continues to take concrete actions]{.mark} to
fulfill its commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six
Assurances, [assisting Taiwan in strengthening its defensive
capabilities]{.mark}," Mr. Chang said in a statement. "[We express our
deepest gratitude]{.mark}. "]{.underline}Taiwanese Air Force personnel

decades, to China's chagrin. At a regularly scheduled news briefing in
Beijing on Tuesday, Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, expressed opposition to the sales, saying they could harm
relations between China and the United States. China has already
expressed displeasure with Ms. Tsai's plans to spend a total of four
days in the United States, part of a trip in which she will also visit
diplomatic allies in the Caribbean. Taiwan's deputy foreign minister,
Miguel Tsao, announced on July 1 that Ms. Tsai would spend two nights in
the United States before and after visiting the Caribbean countries of
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and
Haiti from Thursday to July 22.In addition to the recently approved arms
packages, Taiwan in late February also requested 66 F-16V fighter jets
from the United States. And in April, Washington approved a \$500
million package that included F-16 parts and training. Mr.
Hammond-Chambers of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council said the Trump
administration, with broad support from Congress, had moved to
regularize and normalize arms sales to Taiwan, reflecting "a sound and
responsible policy that will maximize the deterrent nature of a modern,
well-equipped Taiwan military capable of complicating and deterring any
actions by the P.L.A. ["[An official with Taiwan's Ministry of National
Defense]{.mark}, who spoke on condition of anonymity, [said]{.mark} that
he expected the F-16 sales to go forward, saying that [ties with

#### Ending arms sales to Taiwan causes Chinese aggression and erodes the confidence of other allies in the region leading to proliferation and reducing American influence---turns case

Importance of United States' Arms Sales for Taiwan's Defense", 10/6/17,

RKK)

[Relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States
have been tense]{.underline} for some time, with the issues of China's
expansionism in the South China Sea and conflicting objectives regarding
North Korea exacerbating tensions. However, [if there is one issue to
stand out as putting the most stress on the relationship, it would be
the issue of the United States' support for Taiwan, and the recent arms
deal would indicate this.]{.underline} On June 29, 2017, [the Trump
administration announced a new round of arms sales with Taiwan worth
\$1.42B, sparking Chinese ire]{.underline}. This is first such arms sale
under President Trump and the first sale since former President Barack
Obama announced a \$1.83B deal in 2015. [China demanded that the U.S.
revoke the deal]{.underline}, claiming that the sale violated the
consensus on good relations reached between Trump and Chinese premier Xi
Jinping. [It is unlikely that the United States would honor this demand,
as it views the arms sales to be incredibly important]{.underline}. To
understand this importance one must first understand the history of the
sales. In 1979, the United States and China normalized relations,
forcing the United States to sever official relations with Taiwan in the
process. Immediately, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which
stated that the "United States shall make available to Taiwan such
defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be
necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability as determined by the President and the Congress." This act
serves as the bedrock of the continued arms sales. **[The United States
is virtually the only country providing Taiwan with
weapons]{.underline}**. The arms sales continued, with some sort of a
sales agreement every year between 1980-2010. The 1982 August 17
Communiqué, which stated that the United States would gradually reduce
arms sales to Taiwan, and the Six Assurances to Taiwan, which stated
that the U.S. wouldn't set an end date for the arms sales, alter the
Taiwan Relations Act, or consult China in advance of making decisions
about the arms deals set the stage for a contentious and confusing
arrangement[. The support for arms sales has been bipartisan, with every
U.S. president since Jimmy Carter announcing arms sales]{.underline}.
While some presidents have sought to reduce the visibility of the
sales[, no president declined to sell Taiwan arms]{.underline}. However,
the erratic timing has caused lawmakers such as Arizona Senator John
McCain to push for a more regularized process for arms sales to ensure
that Taiwan always receives arms. All U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are
virulently opposed by China. The sales, which include weapons ranging
from decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates and surface-to-air missiles to
early warning radar, are viewed by China as an infringement on its
sovereignty. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has stated
that it would retake it by force if necessary. The U.S. providing Taiwan
with weapons is viewed by China as interference in its domestic affairs
and a prolonging of the process of reunification. China's actions,
including its 2015 announcement that it would sanction the U.S. firms
selling arms to Taiwan, reveal its anger. [While angering China has a
negative effect of the arms sales, the importance for the United States
that they continue consistently outweighs it.]{.underline} By 2011,
China had nearly 2,000 missiles aimed at Taiwan, and more recently in
March of this year, it was revealed that Dongfeng 16 (DF-16) medium
range ballistic missiles were added to the mix of missiles. Most
Taiwanese prefer the current status quo of no independence or
reunification. China's policy of eventual reunification runs counter to
this. [The provision of arms by the United States ensures that Taiwan
can continue on its current path, and that it can resist China's
attempts at "Finlandizing" it]{.underline}. [The status quo has kept the
peace between China and Taiwan, and the arms sales have played a key
role in sustaining this]{.underline}. [Along with U.S. troops in Japan
and South Korea, **the sales are one of the most visible signs of
American commitment to its allies in the region**. **The arms sales go
beyond verbal support and show the United States providing an ally with
tools of hard power**.]{.underline} [The United States exports arms to
several countries in the region**. American weapons account for around
90% of Japan's weapons imports, 60% of Australia's, 59% of South Korea's
and 41% of the Philippines'. Each sale holds weight because it signals
this same commitment to them as it does for Taiwan**. The status quo
upheld by the arms deal extends beyond Taiwan**. Ending an almost 40
year policy would send shockwaves through the region and could very well
encourage Chinese aggression**. **If the United States ended the sale of
arms, China and American allies in the region would likely view it as
U.S. appeasement of China**]{.underline}. **[The perceived weakening of
the U.S. could encourage China to take more aggressive actions,
potentially sparking a dangerous crisis. Furthermore, it could greatly
erode the confidence of America's Asia-Pacific allies, namely South
Korea, Japan and the Philippines, who all have defense treaties with the
U.S. These allies may worry that their own arms deals are in jeopardy
and that the U.S. is not seriously committed to their defense, forcing
them to pursue other options and eroding American influence in the
region.]{.underline}** [The arms sales to Taiwan have been one of the
most consequential foreign policy actions by the United States in recent
history. They have kept the peaceful status quo and have publicly
displayed America's commitment to its allies. With China's continued
rise, the arms sales are more important now than ever before to keep the
tensions in the Asia-Pacific from boiling over.]{.underline}

#### Extinction -- multiple scenarios that turn the case

**Kroenig 15** \[Matthew Kroenig (2015) The History of Proliferation
Optimism: Does It Have a Future?, Journal of Strategic
Studies, 38:1-2, 98-125, DOI: [10.1080/01402390.2014.893508](https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)\]

[Why Nuclear Proliferation Is a Problem]{.underline}

[The spread of nuclear weapons poses **at least six severe threats** to
international peace]{.underline} and security including: nuclear war,
nuclear terrorism, global and regional instability, constrained US
freedom of action, weakened alliances, and further nuclear
proliferation. [Each of these threats has received extensive treatment
elsewhere]{.underline} and this review is not intended to replicate or
even necessarily to improve upon these previous efforts. Rather the
goals of this section are more modest: to usefully bring together and
recap the many reasons why we should be pessimistic about the likely
consequences of nuclear proliferation. Many of these threats will be
illuminated with a discussion of a case of much contemporary concern:
Iran's advanced nuclear program.

**[Nuclear War]{.underline}**

T[he greatest threat posed by the spread of nuclear weapons is
**nuclear** **war**.]{.underline} The more states in possession of
nuclear weapons, [the greater the probability that somewhere, someday,
there will be a catastrophic nuclear war.]{.underline}

To date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945,
the United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the
65-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear
weapons are unusable, but it would be naïve to think that nuclear
weapons will never be used again simply because they have not been used
for some time. After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that worldwide
economic downturns like the Great Depression were a thing of the past,
only to be surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in the decade
and the Great Recession of the late 2000s. This author, for one, would
be surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime in his
lifetime.

Before reaching a state of MAD, [new nuclear states go through a
transition period in which they lack a secure-second strike
capability]{.underline}. In this context, one or both states might
believe that it has an incentive to use nuclear weapons first. For
example, [if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its
nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will have a secure, second-strike
capability]{.underline}. Even though it is believed to have a large
arsenal, given its small size and lack of strategic depth, [Israel might
not be confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and respond with
a devastating counterstrike.]{.underline} Similarly, Iran might
eventually be able to build a large and survivable nuclear arsenal, but,
when it first crosses the nuclear threshold, Tehran will have a small
and vulnerable nuclear force.

In these pre-MAD situations, [there are **at least three ways** that
nuclear war could occur.]{.underline} First, **[the state with the
nuclear advantage might believe it has a splendid first strike
capability.]{.underline}** In a crisis, Israel might, therefore, decide
to launch a preventive nuclear strike to disarm Iran's nuclear
capabilities. **[Indeed, this incentive might be further increased by
Israel's aggressive strategic culture that emphasizes preemptive
action.]{.underline}** Second, [the state with a small and vulnerable
nuclear arsenal, in this case Iran, might feel use them or lose them
pressures]{.underline}. That is, in a crisis, [Iran might decide to
strike first rather than risk having its entire nuclear arsenal
destroyed.]{.underline} Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued, [nuclear
war could result due to the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack.]{.underline} If there are advantages to striking first, [one
state might start a nuclear war in the belief that war is inevitable and
that it would be better to go first than to go second.]{.underline}
Fortunately, there is no historic evidence of this dynamic occurring in
a nuclear context, but it is still possible. In an Israeli--Iranian
crisis, for example, Israel and Iran might both prefer to avoid a
nuclear war, but decide to strike first rather than suffer a devastating
first attack from an opponent.

Even in a world of MAD, however, [when both sides have secure,
second-strike capabilities, there is still a risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}. [Rational deterrence theory assumes nuclear-armed
states are governed by rational leaders who would not intentionally
launch a suicidal nuclear war.]{.underline} This assumption appears to
have applied to past and current nuclear powers, [but there is **no
guarantee** that it will continue to hold in the future.]{.underline}
Iran's theocratic government, despite its inflammatory rhetoric, has
followed a fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it contains
leaders who hold millenarian religious worldviews and could one day
ascend to power. [We cannot rule out the possibility that, as nuclear
weapons continue to spread, some leader somewhere will choose to launch
a nuclear war]{.underline}, knowing full well that it could result in
self-destruction.

One does not need to resort to irrationality, however, to imagine
nuclear war under MAD. [Nuclear weapons may deter leaders from
intentionally launching full-scale wars, but they do not mean the end of
international politics]{.underline}. As was discussed above,
[nuclear-armed states still have conflicts of interest and leaders still
seek to coerce nuclear-armed adversaries]{.underline}. Leaders might,
therefore, choose to launch a limited nuclear
war.[50](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)50 Knorr, Limited
Strategic War.View all notes This strategy might be especially
attractive to states in a position of conventional inferiority that
might have an incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to the nuclear
level. During the Cold War, [the United States planned to use nuclear
weapons first to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's
conventional
inferiority.]{.underline}[51](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)51 Of
course there is no guarantee that Washington would have used nuclear
weapons as planned in the event of actual conflict. It should be noted
that US nuclear threats were intended not only to deter the Soviet
Union, but also to reassure NATO partners and dissuade them from seeking
independent nuclear forces.View all notes As Russia's conventional power
has deteriorated since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely
more heavily on nuclear weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed,
[Russian strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons early in a
conflict]{.underline} (something that most Western strategists would
consider to be escalatory) [as a way to de-escalate a
crisis.]{.underline} Similarly, Pakistan's military plans for nuclear
use in the event of an invasion from conventionally stronger India. And
finally, Chinese generals openly talk about the possibility of nuclear
use against a US superpower in a possible East Asia contingency.

Second, as was also discussed above, [leaders can make a 'threat that
leaves something to
chance']{.underline}.[52](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)52 Schelling, Arms
and Influence.View all notes They can initiate a nuclear crisis. [By
playing these risky games of nuclear brinkmanship, states can increase
the risk of nuclear war in an attempt to force a less resolved adversary
to back down]{.underline}. Historical crises have not resulted in
nuclear war, but many of them, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis,
have come close. And scholars have documented historical incidents when
accidents nearly led to
war.[53](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)53 Scott

nuclear crisis dyads, such as Iran and Israel, with fewer sources of
stability than existed during the Cold War, [we can see that there is a
real risk that a future crisis could result in a devastating nuclear
exchange.]{.underline}

**[Nuclear Terrorism]{.underline}**

[The spread of nuclear weapons also increases the risk of nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}.[54](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)54 Michael

history, it would have been much worse had Osama Bin Laden possessed

declaring it permissible to use nuclear weapons in Jihad against the
West.[55](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)55 Fissile

[Analysts have pointed out the tremendous hurdles that terrorists would
have to overcome in order to acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.[58](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)58 Levi, On
Nuclear Terrorism.View all notes Nevertheless, [as nuclear weapons
spread, the possibility that they will]{.underline} eventually
[fall]{.underline} [into]{.underline} [terrorist hands
increases.]{.underline} States could intentionally transfer nuclear
weapons, or the fissile material required to build them, to terrorist
groups. There are good reasons why a state might be reluctant to
transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, [as nuclear weapons spread,
the probability that a leader might someday purposely arm a terrorist
group increases.]{.underline} Some fear, for example, that Iran, with
its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah, might be at a heightened risk of
transferring nuclear weapons to terrorists. Moreover, [even if no state
would ever intentionally transfer nuclear capabilities to terrorists, a
new nuclear state, with underdeveloped security procedures, might be
vulnerable to theft]{.underline}, allowing terrorist groups or corrupt
or ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer dangerous material to
terrorists. There is evidence, for example, that representatives from
Pakistan's atomic energy establishment met with Al-Qa'eda members to
discuss a possible nuclear
deal.[59](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)59 David
Albright, Peddling Peril: How the Secret Nuclear Trade Arms America's
Enemies (New York: Free Press 2012).View all notes

Finally, [a nuclear-armed state could collapse]{.underline},
[resulting]{.underline} [in]{.underline} a breakdown of law and order
and [a loose nukes problem]{.underline}. US officials are currently very
concerned about what would happen to Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the
government were to fall. As nuclear weapons spread, this problem is only
further amplified. Iran is a country with a history of revolutions and a
government with a tenuous hold on power. The regime change that
Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran could actually become a
nightmare if a nuclear-armed Iran suffered a breakdown in authority,
forcing us to worry about the fate of Iran's nuclear arsenal.

**[Regional Instability]{.underline}**

[The spread of nuclear weapons]{.underline} also [**emboldens** nuclear
powers, contributing to **regional instability.**]{.underline} States
that lack nuclear weapons need to fear direct military attack from other
states, but [states with nuclear weapons can be confident that they can
deter an intentional military attack]{.underline}, [giving them **an
incentive to be more aggressive**]{.underline} in the conduct of their
foreign policy. In this way, [nuclear weapons provide a shield under
which states can feel free to engage in lower-level
aggression.]{.underline} Indeed, international relations theories about
[the 'stability-instability paradox' maintain that stability at the
nuclear level contributes to conventional
instability]{.underline}.[60](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)60 Glenn
H. Snyder, 'The Balance of Power and the Balance of Terror,' in Paul
Seabury (ed.), The Balance of Power (San Francisco: Chandler 1965),
184--201.View all notes

Historically, [we have seen that the spread of nuclear weapons has
emboldened their possessors and contributed to regional
instability]{.underline}. Recent scholarly analyses have demonstrated
that, after controlling for other relevant factors, nuclear-weapon
states are more likely to engage in conflict than nonnuclear-weapon
states and that this aggressiveness is more pronounced in new nuclear
states that have less experience with nuclear
diplomacy.[61](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)61 Robert

Conflict: Does Experience Matter?' Journal of Conflict Resolution 53/2

decision-making in Pakistan reveals that [Pakistani foreign policymakers
may have been emboldened by the acquisition of nuclear weapons, which
encouraged them to initiate militarized disputes against
India]{.underline}.[62](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)62 Kapur, Dangerous
Deterrent.View all notes

Currently, Iran restrains its foreign policy because it fears major
military retaliation from the United States or Israel, but with nuclear
weapons it could feel free to push harder. A [nuclear-armed Iran would
likely step up support to terrorist and proxy groups and engage in more
aggressive coercive diplomacy.]{.underline} With a nuclear-armed Iran
increasingly throwing its weight around in the region, we could witness
an even more crisis prone Middle East. And in a poly-nuclear Middle East
with Israel, Iran, and, in the future, possibly other states, armed with
nuclear weapons, any one of those crises could result in a catastrophic
nuclear exchange.

**[Constrained Freedom of Action]{.underline}**

[The spread of nuclear weapons also disadvantages American's national
security by constraining US freedom of action]{.underline}. As the most
powerful country on the planet, with the ability to project power to
every corner of the globe, the United States has the ability to threaten
or protect every other state in the international system. [This is a
significant source of strategic leverage and maintaining freedom of
action has been an important objective of US national security
policy]{.underline}.[63](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)63 See,
for example, Donald Rumsfeld, The National Defense Strategy of the
United States of America (Washington DC: Dept. of Defense March
2005).View all notes

As nuclear weapons spread, however, America's military freedom of action
will be constrained. [The United States can]{.underline} use, or
[credibly threaten to use, force against nonnuclear states]{.underline}.
The threat of military action against nuclear-armed states is much less
credible, however, because nuclear-armed states can deter US military
action with the threat of nuclear retaliation. In January 2012, for
example, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow Persian
Gulf waterway through which roughly 20 per cent of the world's oil
flows, and the United States issued a counter-threat, declaring that
Washington would use force to reopen the Strait if necessary. If Iran
had had nuclear weapons, however, Washington's threats would have been
much less credible. Would a US President really be willing to risk
nuclear war with Iran in order to keep the Strait open? Maybe. But,
maybe not[. While the United States might not be deterred in every
contingency against a nuclear-armed state]{.underline}, it is clear
that, at a minimum, [the spread of nuclear weapons greatly complicates
US decisions to use force.]{.underline} Again, optimists might argue
that this effect demonstrates their argument, but it only partially
demonstrates part of it. It is indeed a reason why proliferation might
dampen conventional conflict, but it is also reason why, from
Washington's perspective, more would be worse, not better.

**[Undermines Alliances]{.underline}**

[The spread of nuclear weapons also complicates US alliance
relationships.]{.underline} Washington uses the promise of military
protection as a way to cement its alliance structures. [US
allies]{.underline} depend on America's protection, [giv]{.underline}ing
[Washington influence over allied states' foreign policies]{.underline}.
Historically, the United States has offered, and threatened to retract,
the security guarantee carrot to prevent allied states from acting
contrary to its interests. [As nuclear weapons spread, however,
alliances held together by promises of military protection are
undermined in two ways]{.underline}. First, [US allies may doubt the
credibility of Washington's commitments to provide a military defense
against nuclear-armed states, leading them to weaken ties with their
patron.]{.underline} Recall Charles de Gaulle's doubts about
Washington's willingness to trade New York for Paris. Similarly, [if
Iran acquires nuclear weapons, US partners in the Middle
East]{.underline}, such as Israel and the Gulf states, [will question
Washington's resolve to defend them from Iran]{.underline}. [While some
states might]{.underline} very well [seek]{.underline} [American
protection]{.underline} from a nuclear-armed Iran, drawing them closer
to Washington, [others might go the other way]{.underline}. After all,
if the United States proves unwilling to use force to prevent Iran from
acquiring nuclear weapons, would our allies in the region really believe
that Washington would be willing to fight a war against a nuclear-armed
Iran? Qatar, for example, already appears to be hedging its bets,
loosening ties to Washington and warming to Tehran.

Second, [nuclear proliferation could encourage client states to acquire
nuclear weapons themselves, giving]{.underline} them [greater security
independence and making]{.underline} them [less dependable
allies.]{.underline} According to many scholars, the acquisition of
the force de frappe was instrumental in permitting the French Fifth
Republic under President Charles de Gaulle to pursue a foreign policy
path independent from Washington and
NATO.[64](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)64 See,

**[Further Proliferation]{.underline}**

[Nuclear proliferation poses an additional threat to international
peace]{.underline} and security [because it causes further
proliferation]{.underline}. As former Secretary of State George Schultz
once said, 'proliferation begets
proliferation'[65](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)65 Philipp
Bleek, 'The Nuclear Domino Myth: Why Proliferation Rarely Begets
Proliferation', PhD dissertation, Department of Government, Georgetown
Univ., 2010.View all notes [When one country acquires nuclear weapons,
its regional adversaries, feeling threatened by its neighbor's new
nuclear capabilities, are more likely to attempt to acquire nuclear
weapons in response]{.underline}. Indeed, [the history of nuclear
proliferation can be read as one long chain reaction of
proliferation.]{.underline}

Of course, reactive proliferation does not always occur. In the early
1960s, for example, US officials worried that a nuclear-armed China
would cause Taiwan, Japan, India, Pakistan, and other states to acquire
nuclear
weapons.[66](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)66 Francis
J. Gavin, 'Blasts from the Past: Proliferation Lessons from the
1960s', International Security 29/3 (Winter 2004/2005), 100--35.View all
notes In hindsight, we now know that they were correct in some cases,
but wrong in others. Using statistical analysis, Philipp Bleek has shown
that reactive proliferation is not automatic, but that rather, [states
are more likely to proliferate in response to neighbors when three
conditions are met (1) there is an intense security rivalry between the
two countries, (2) the potential proliferant state does not have a
security guarantee from a nuclear-armed patron (3) and the potential
proliferant state has the industrial and technical capacity to launch an
indigenous nuclear
program.]{.underline}[67](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)67 Bleek,
'The Nuclear Domino Myth'.View all notes In other words, reactive
proliferation is real, but conditional. To be sure, as Barry Posen has
argued, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey all have primitive nuclear
infrastructures and it would be difficult for any of them to build
nuclear weapons overnight. In addition, [Turkey is a member of NATO and
Saudi Arabia enjoys a close security partnership with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and these states might prefer
to lounge in the shade of America's nuclear umbrella rather than build
independent arsenals. On the other hand, [one or more of these
states]{.underline}, much like the United Kingdom and France in the
early days of the Cold War[, might decide that America's nuclear
protection is insufficient]{.underline}. With a decade's worth of
dedicated nuclear development, any of these states could conceivably
become nuclear powers. Just because reactive proliferation takes time,
does not mean that it is not a problem. If Iran enters the nuclear club,
therefore, it is likely that some, but not all, of the countries that we
currently worry about will eventually become nuclear powers.

[We should worry about the spread of nuclear weapons in every
case]{.underline}, therefore, [because the problem will likely extend
beyond that specific cas]{.underline}e. As Wohlstetter cautioned decades
ago, proliferation is an N+1
problem.[69](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2014.893508)69 Wohlstetter,
'Nuclear sharing'.View all notes

In sum, nuclear proliferation gives us many reasons to fear the spread
of nuclear weapons to additional states. While [it is important not
to]{.underline} exaggerate the above threats, it would be an even
greater sin to [underestimate them]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, as a
result, not [take the steps necessary to combat the spread of the
world's most dangerous weapons.]{.underline}

[[Congress continues to act as a bastion of support for the US-Taiwan
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just this week[, [Senator Tom
Cotton]{.underline}]{.mark} [(R-AR), along with Senators Robert Menendez
(D-NJ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Catherine Cortez Masto
(D-NV), and Chris Coons (D-DE) [introduced the Taiwan Assurance
Act]{.mark}. The bipartisan bill, unveiled in advance of the Taiwan
Relations Act's 40th anniversary in April, takes note of the "close
relationship" between Taiwan and the United States and of that
relationship's "enormous benefit to both parties and to the Indo-Pacific
region as a whole]{.underline}." It also takes note of China's ongoing
efforts to isolate, intimidate, and otherwise threaten the island.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen speaks at the Los Angeles Overseas
Chinese Banquet during her visit in Los Angeles, California, August 12,
2018. Reuters Non-binding [[language in the]{.mark} Taiwan Assurance
[Act calls for "regular transfers of defense articles to
Taiwan,]{.mark}" resumption of trade and investment talks "with the goal
of reaching a bilateral free trade agreement," and US advocacy for
Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in international
organizations]{.underline}. Binding language mandates that the defense
attaché at the American Institute in Taiwan be a general or flag officer
and requires the secretary of defense to "make efforts to include
Taiwanese forces in bilateral and multilateral military exercises." This
latter provision marks a step beyond previous legislation that described
the "sense of Congress" as supporting Taiwan's inclusion in such
exercises. The Taiwan Assurance Act requires that the president submits
to the House and Senate foreign affairs committees a report on the
results of a State Department review of its Guidelines on Relations with
Taiwan and on implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act. The Act
encourages, but does not mandate, that the State Department guidelines
"be crafted with the intent to deepen and expand United States-Taiwan
relations," in accord with "the reality that Taiwan is governed by a
representative democratic government ... and that Taiwan is a free and
open society that respects universal human rights and democratic
values," and "be consistent with the longstanding, comprehensive,
strategic, and values-based relationship." Senator Cotton here aims to
bring about a revision of the State Department guidelines, which have
long inhibited smooth bilateral relations. That State Department
officials cannot meet Taiwan counterparts in executive office buildings
is an inconvenience that, one imagines, must have at times deterred such
meetings. Refusal to treat visiting Taiwan dignitaries with the
formalities and honors granted other foreign visitors denies them
dignity without meaningfully advancing US interests in Asia. Ensuring
that Taiwan's foreign and defense ministers do not step foot in
Washington, DC---indeed, keeping them outside the Beltway
entirely---denies American senior national security officials
opportunities to engage with counterparts from a country with whom the
United States could one day conceivably fight alongside in a conflict
with a rival nuclear power. The Cotton bill builds upon other
legislation that relates to Taiwan. Last month, Senator Marco Rubio
introduced the Countering the Chinese Government and Communist Party's
Political Influence Operations Act. While the act is primarily concerned
with countering malign People Republic of China's (PRC) influence in the
United States, it does describe US policy as, in part, "to enhance
cooperation and coordination with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
Taiwan ... whose governments and institutions have faced acute pressure
from the political influence operations of the Government of China and
the Communist Party of China." This language not only recognizes the
severe challenge Taiwan faces, but also treats Taiwan as no different
from countries with which the United States has official diplomatic
relations. Taken together, a number of acts in recent years---notably
the national defense authorization acts, the Taiwan Travel Act, and the
Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA)---have put the US-Taiwan
relationship on firmer footing, pushing it towards a more normal
relationship. In 2017, [when [Senator Cory Gardner]{.mark} first
announced his intention to introduce ARIA, he [promised that the bill
would "unequivocally back Taiwan as our important security partner,
including authorizing new arms sales and providing for enhanced
diplomatic contacts in Taipei]{.mark}." The senator delivered on that
promise[. ARIA, which President Trump signed into law in late 2018,
listed Taiwan among America's most important security partners]{.mark}
in Asia, a list that includes US treaty allies. The act [reaffirmed US
commitment to Taiwan in the economic, diplomatic, and security realms;
called for regular arms sales to Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}; and
encouraged "the travel of high level United States officials to Taiwan,
in accordance with the Taiwan Travel Act." Senator Gardner further
reinforced this commitment in a speech at a joint Global Taiwan
Institute-Project 2049 Institute event earlier this month. The
congressional view on US-Taiwan relations, [Gardner said, "is that the
United States must consistently grow our relationship with Taipei."
Perhaps even more ambitiously, "we must pursue every available avenue of
cooperation with Taipei allowable under US law."]{.underline} Indeed,
there is not actually much activity that US law disallows when it comes
to US-Taiwan cooperation. To whit, in February, Gardner, Cotton, and
three other senators addressed a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy
Pelosi encouraging her to invite Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to
address a joint session of Congress. Such an invitation, while unlikely,
would be unprecedented but entirely consistent with US law and,
arguably, with the American "One China" policy as well. None of this is
to say that Senators Rubio, Cotton, and Gardner or others on Capitol
Hill are seeking to re-establish diplomatic relations between the United
States and the Republic of China (as Taiwan is officially known).
Indeed, both ARIA and the Taiwan Assurance Act note that relations with
Taipei should be handled in accordance with the Three Joint Communiqués
(in the former) and the "One China" policy (in the latter[). Rather,
they want Washington to treat, and engage with, Taipei much as it would
any other diplomatic partner. A more normal relationship with Taiwan has
both symbolic and substantial value[. Treating Taiwan as a normal
diplomatic partner]{.mark}---as the United States did last week when its
ambassador to Palau met with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen during her
visit there---[underscores American commitment]{.mark} to the island's
continuing de facto [independence and can help to dispel doubts in
Beijing that Washington would actually go to Taipei's aide in the event
of a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. As things stand, strategic ambiguity
may be more ambiguous than Washington currently intends. Loosening of
the State Department's Taiwan guidelines would allow for regular,
high-level discussions between Taiwan and American national security
officials[. American men and women may one day be asked to put their
lives on the line to defend Taiwan]{.underline}---that senior American
leaders, including the president, do not engage with their counterparts
in Taipei is a travesty. In carrying out such engagement, American
leaders would better keep faith with American soldiers, sailors,
marines, and airmen. American leaders would, moreover, develop a deeper
understanding of how Taiwan's leaders might react in the event of a
crisis, and vice versa, thus making for better crisis management.
Finally, direct engagement on contingency planning at the highest levels
of government would enhance confidence in both capitals---and in
Beijing---that those plans would be executed in the event of an
emergency. The United States should not let precedent inhibit its
interactions with Taiwan. Rather, it can and should move deliberately,
but consistently, towards a more normal relationship with Taiwan. There
is much that Washington can do within the framework of the "One China"
policy, but there is no need to do it all at once. Washington should not
be overly sympathetic to Chinese claims of "hurt feelings," but avoiding
surprises is important for the maintenance of a relatively stable,
predictable US-China relationship. The Trump administration is
remarkably friendly to Taiwan, but it [is [Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that [has continued to drive progre]{.mark}ss in the relationship. That
[is likely to remain so through 2020 and beyond. Importantly, support
for Taiwan in Congress is and has long been
bipartisan]{.mark}]{.underline}. The "Countering the Chinese Government
and Communist Party's Political Influence Operations Act" had two
democratic co-sponsors, including the ranking member of the foreign
relations committee's Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and
International Cybersecurity Policy. Half of ARIA's co-sponsors were
Democrats, including former vice presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine
(D-VA). Bipartisan action may seem uncommon in today's Washington, but
it is the norm when it comes to legislation supporting Taiwan and
US-Taiwan relations. Members of both parties can be expected to continue
exploring ways to deepen bilateral relations during the remainder of the
Trump administration's first term. Look for members of the armed
services committees to continue encouraging closer defense and
military-to-military ties. Related, it would be relatively
non-controversial, but helpful, for the foreign affairs committees to
advance legislation requiring the secretary of state to respond to
letters of request for arms sales within a defined time limit.
Congressional advocacy for a free trade agreement is possible, too,
though it will, of course, be up to the executive branch to negotiate
any such deal. To be sure, the Trump administration deserves credit for
advancing US-Taiwan ties over the last two years. It is Congress,
however, that remains at the forefront of an ongoing effort to shape a
more normal bilateral relationship. That congressional leadership will
be vital if the relationship is to continue flourishing in the years
ahead. The main point: Congress remains a bastion of support for
US-Taiwan relations and is providing important leadership in shaping
that relationship for a new era. Taiwan US-Taiwan relations

[[The]{.mark} US [House]{.mark} of Representatives on Tuesday [passed
the Taiwan Assurance Act]{.mark} of 2019 and House Resolution 273
[reaffirming the US' commitment to Taiwan]{.mark} and the implementation
of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). [The]{.mark} Taiwan Assurance [Act
was passed without objection, while the resolution was carried in a vote
of 414 votes in favor, zero against]{.mark} and 17 abstentions. "It is
the sense of \[the US\] Congress that Taiwan is a vital part of the
United States free and open Indo-Pacific strategy,"]{.underline}
[[the]{.mark} Taiwan Assurance [Act]{.mark} [reads.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[The US should "conduct regular sales and transfers of defense articles
to Taiwan in order to enhance its self-defense capabilities]{.mark},
particularly its efforts to develop and integrate asymmetric
capabilities, including undersea warfare and defense capabilities, into
its military forces," it says.]{.underline} In the fourth section on
"Taiwan's Inclusion in International Organizations," the Taiwan
Assurance Act says that it is US policy to advocate for the nation's
"meaningful participation" in international bodies "as appropriate,"
giving as examples the UN, the World Health Assembly, the International
Civil Aviation Organization and the International Criminal Police
Organization, commonly known as Interpol. It is also US policy to
advocate for Taiwan's membership in the Food and Agriculture
Organization, UNESCO and "other international organizations for which
statehood is not a requirement for membership," it says. It requires the
US secretary of state to review the US Department of State's guidance
governing relations with Taiwan, including its "Guidelines on Relations
with Taiwan" and other documents, and to reissue the guidance to the US
government's executive branch departments and agencies within 180 days
of enactment. Meanwhile, [the resolution says that the TRA and the "six
assurances" have been "essential components in helping to maintain
peace, security and stability in the Western Pacific," and are
"cornerstones" of US policy toward Taiwan]{.underline}. The House
encourages mutual visits between US and Taiwanese officials, per the
Taiwan Travel Act that was signed into law in March last year, the
resolution says. [It also reiterates that the US president should
conduct "regular transfers of defense articles to Taiwan consistent with
Taiwan's national security requirements in accordance to prior
legislation."]{.underline}It calls on the secretary of state to
"actively engage internationally in support of Taiwan's meaningful
participation in international organizations engaged in addressing
transnational threats and challenges," and recognizes Taiwan's
"partnership in combating global terrorism[." [In Taipei
yesterday]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [Presidential]{.mark} [Office spokesman
Xavier Chang (張惇涵) thanked the House for its support]{.mark},
[saying]{.mark} that the passage of [the resolution is especially
important]{.mark} on the 40th anniversary of the TRA[. Calling the US
Taiwan's "most important partner in the international
community]{.mark}," Chang said that [the]{.mark} [government's efforts
over the past three years have allowed it to be seen as a reliable
partner in maintaining the "status quo" of regional peace and
stability]{.mark}. Taiwan's strategic importance is no longer restricted
to the Taiwan Strait, but now includes the Pacific, he said. Taiwan
would continue to play a role in maintaining the "status quo" of
regional peace and stability with its partners, he added.]{.underline}

The cover story in this issue of Taiwan Business TOPICS looks back with
appreciation to 40 years ago this month when the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA), freshly passed by Congress, became U.S. law with President
Jimmy Carter's signature. [The [drafting of the TRA]{.mark} -- a process
in which AmCham Taipei is proud to have played a part -- [ended]{.mark}
several months of frustrating [uncertainty as to]{.mark} how economic,
cultural, and [security cooperation between the United States and
Taiwan]{.mark} could be maintained without a relationship of diplomatic
recognition. The value of the TRA in helping assure Taiwan's stability
and prosperity over the past four decades has been immeasurable. The
[expressions of American support written into the statute enabled
Taiwan]{.mark} to absorb the shock of losing formal diplomatic ties with
the U.S., its closest ally, and [to move on with
confidence]{.mark}.]{.underline} The American Institute in Taiwan took
the place of the U.S. embassy and managed to perform nearly the same
functions, while its counterpart, the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office, played a similar role in Washington. Sales [to
Taiwan of American defensive weapons continued as needed, and the two
countries have remained among each other's top trading partners, with
total two-way trade last year of US\$76 bilion]{.underline}. Facilitated
by the visa-waiver program introduced in 2012, Taiwanese citizens last
year made some 475,000 trips to the United States. The TRA also gave
major multinational corporations, many of them represented in the AmCham
membership, the confidence to make substantial investments in Taiwan.
[Over the decades, political relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have
had their ups and downs. But [there is broad agreement that the current
state of mutual trust and cooperation is higher than it has been in
years]{.mark}. Recent statements by high-level U.S. officials such as
Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have lauded
Taiwan's democratic development and contribution to the peace and
security of the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} In addition, AIT is preparing
to move early next month into a new US\$255.6 million office complex, a
concrete symbol of the long-term American commitment to Taiwan, in
Taipei's Neihu district. And on the security front, the U.S. has
recently indicated willingness to provide F-16V aircraft to Taiwan in
the first military sales of jet fighters to the island since 1992. As
with any relationship, there is always room for improvement.
Encouragingly, Taiwan's numerous friends on both sides of the aisle in
the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have lately been active in
proposing new resolutions and legislation of support. Of particular
significance is a proposed Taiwan Assurance Act that would further
enhance the bilateral relationship by addressing some issues not
foreseen at the time the TRA was enacted. These include the holding of
regular annual trade talks and the need for U.S. government efforts to
help Taiwan achieve meaningful participation in vital international
organizations such as the World Health Assembly, the International Civil
Aviation Organization, and Interpol. The TRA has served well in
providing a solid foundation for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. Now this
40th anniversary year is an appropriate time to buttress the
relationship further with strong additional legislation.

I believe one of the issues for U.S. and Japan's cooperation is to keep
the stability of cross-strait. However, President Xi Jinping's recent
remarks doesn't rule out use of force to take over Taiwan. I wish to
hear both of your position. And another question for you, Senator. When
are you reintroducing the Taipei Act? Thank you. SEN. GARDNER: Thank
you. Yeah, thank you. Look, obviously -- Mike, I don't know if you
wanted to go first on that question. I'm sorry to jump in. MR. GREEN:
No, no. SEN. GARDNER: [So [the Asia Reassurance Initiative
has]{.underline}]{.mark} [significant [language dedicated to the U.S.
relationship with Taiwan]{.mark}, from the Six Assurances, restating our
adherence to them; [making sure that we regularize arms sales]{.mark},
routinize arms sales to Taiwan; [and]{.mark} making sure that we [have
high-level visits to Taiwa]{.mark}n from the United States. And we will
continue to pursue those commitments and protections. I think we've made
that very clear to -- I had Ambassador Hsueh in my office here a couple
of weeks ago and made those provisions part of our conversation. And
[our commitment to our relationship with Taiwan is stronger than
ever]{.mark}. And as it -- as it relates to the TAIPEI Act, the TAIPEI
Act is legislation that we put forward that says the administration is
authorized to deny federal funding, deny aid to countries that back away
from their relationship with Taiwan. We introduced it last year as a
bipartisan bill. We will introduce that again soon in the new
Congress]{.underline}. MR. HAYASHI: There's no such big debate or sexy
discussions about Taiwan in Tokyo nowadays. And, you know, trade
relationship is very nice. And also, you know, betterment between the
China-Japan is not affecting so much politically in a negative way for
Taiwan-Japan trade relationship. So that there's not -- no such, you
know, change of the status or change of the way of thinking now in Tokyo
as regards to Taiwan. MR. GREEN: I suspect in this room and other rooms
around town we'll be talking a lot more about this cross-straits issue,
especially between the U.S. and Japan. President Tsai's new year's
speech, what she said about the Xi Jinping speech and the 1992
Consensus, if a president of Taiwan had said that a few years ago there
would have been quite a backlash in town. But because of what Xi himself
said about unification being inevitable and so forth; and because of the
growing support for Taiwan, I think it's fair to say, in the Congress
over the last few years; and because of Prime Minister Abe's very close
relationship on a personal basis with many in Taipei -- MR. HAYASHI: His
family. MR. GREEN: With not only his family. And I think this is -- this
is going to be a core issue, maybe the one that tests your strategy the
most -- [SEN. GARDNER: Well, you know, I would say just [the growing
support for Taiwan in the United States Congress]{.mark}. You know,
we've seen over the decades the strength of the U.S.-Israel
relationship. And I use this example because of the bipartisan nature of
the support. [This is a bipartisan cause]{.mark}. It's a bipartisan
effort. [There is bipartisan support for it]{.mark}. You see that same
level of bipartisan support for Taiwan, [and I think that is an
incredibly strong message]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC Link Magnifier

#### Any change in US assurance strategies makes allies uncertain and destroys trust---magnifies the link

**Anderson and Larsen 13** (Justin V. Anderson, Jeffrey A. Larsen,
United States Air Force Institute for National Security Studies,
"Extended Deterrence and Allied Assurance: Key Concepts and Current
Challenges for U.S. Policy", September 2013,
<https://www.usafa.edu/app/uploads/OCP69.pdf>, RKK)

At the close of the George W. Bush administration, U.S. extended
deterrence and allied assurance strategies -- while significantly
evolved from those employed during the early Cold War period, and
strained in some cases by disagreements between Washington and allied
capitals during and after the Second Gulf War -- remained central to the
defense policies and planning of the United States and many of its key
allies. Sixty years after the Allies' victory over the Axis powers, and
nearly twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the United
States continued to represent the primary security broker for states
across the globe, with significant conventional forces deployed abroad,
strategic nuclear forces on rotation or patrol in key regions, and
tactical nuclear weapons remaining available for the defense of NATO or
East Asia against nuclear threats. We will examine current U.S. policies
in greater detail in Part 5.From the end of the Second World War to the
present day, many U.S. allies have generally (if sometimes reluctantly)
accepted U.S. leadership in regard to alliance policymaking and
strategizing. This reflects the fact that the United States represents
the strongest member within a defense pact. Furthermore, [many U.S.
allies believe their defense requirements exceed what they can
independently develop or afford; they depend on their alliance with the
United States to meet their remaining needs. As a result, many U.S.
allies rely on U.S. extended deterrence and assurance strategies to
guarantee their national defense.]{.underline} Over time, these U.S.
strategies -- and the forces associated with them, particularly if
deployed on an ally's home territory -- often become part of an ally's
long-term foreign policy and defense planning. As a result, once the
general strategy for its assurance, and the extension of deterrence to
its key adversaries, is established between the United States and a
foreign ally, the latter often proves resistant to any significant
change to either. Allied objections stem from concerns that any changes
imply an alteration in the U.S. political resolve or military
capabilities that are critical for their defense against foreign
adversaries. Many allies are well aware, for example, that foreign
deployments are frequently a target on Capitol Hill; both during the
Cold War and afterward, Senators reviewing the U.S. defense budget have
perennially 80 pressed for allies to shoulder a greater share of the
burden for their defense. In addition, although conflicts and
contingencies have occasionally raised the number of U.S. troops posted
overseas, in general over the past 20 years the United States has slowly
but perceptibly reduced the numbers of forces permanently stationed
abroad. As a result, **[[any change to U.S. strategies]{.mark},
regardless of how these changes are depicted, [may lead allies to
question whether their status has somehow changed within the eyes of
U.S. leaders.]{.mark} Allies may [wonder if their defense concerns are
still important to Washington]{.mark}; if they are surprised or
unprepared by a shift in U.S. policy or strategy, they may [conclude
their views on these changes were not considered or deemed
important]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Changes in the U.S. military
capabilities deployed in-country or in-theater may also raise issues for
allies, as many are unable to replace these forces using resources
available to their own militaries. In addition, allies resist change
because many have an acute sense that U.S. extended deterrence and
assurance strategies operate within a complex network of political
relationships at the domestic, regional, and international levels -- and
as a result, any changes to these strategies can cascade throughout the
entire system, often with negative impacts for their own country (or
political regime, in cases where these strategies touch on sensitive
local issues). They prefer maintenance of the status quo over changes
that may give rise to some uncertainty -- whether in their own country,
in the minds of adversaries, or both -- regarding whether the United
States remains a reliable and predictable security partner. [Most U.S.
allies, however, also regard the United States as critical to the
deterrence of significant or existential threats to their national
security]{.underline}. As discussed in the historical survey above, they
will debate but rarely flatly oppose U.S. proposals to change extended
deterrence or assurance strategies. Significantly, withdrawals from
defense partnerships or alliances featuring the United States are rare
-- and even when they occur, the states involved often seek to retain
some kind of defense relationship with Washington. As a result, allied
resistance to alterations in extended deterrence and assurance
strategies does not make change impossible, but does underline the
importance of close communication and consultation between Washington
and allied capitals in advance of altering or amending these strategies.
Viewed over the time period discussed in Part 3, their interest in
maintaining the status quo represents a phenomenon that was sometimes
overlooked within the U.S. strategic community -- despite dramatic
geopolitical change, to include superpower détente, the end of the Cold
War, and 81 9/11. [Many longtime U.S. allies remained continually
reliant on their partnership with the United States to shield them from
current enemies, prospective threats, regional instability, and shocks
to the geopolitical system.]{.underline} These policy imperatives
continually shaped the development of U.S. extended deterrence and
allied assurance strategies from 1945-2008. For much of this time
period, the significant challenges associated with defending globally
dispersed allies against a nuclear-armed superpower and its proxies led
the United States to view nuclear forces as central to these strategies.

The Consequences of Distancing Strategies At the core of this theory is
a set of expectations about how an ally will behave when it fears
abandonment by the US. [If the US appears only **partially committed**
to an alliance \-- unwilling to sink its resources and reputation into
protecting its ally -- its ally will fear 36 abandonment more
acutely.]{.underline} Similarly, limited consultations will leave the
ally with less information about the US' plans and goals; the ally will
subsequently be less certain as to how the US will respond should the
ally require assistance. [This theory expects that a fearful, insecure
ally will respond by "**hedging**," a strategy that seeks to
**independently reduce** the threat posed to the ally's security by
China (or other third parties)]{.underline}. 20 [The ally may choose to
pursue hedging primarily by **balancing more aggressively** against
China]{.underline}. In order to do this, [the ally will seek to
**demonstrate its resolve** to defend itself by adopting a more
**confrontational stance** toward China. It may also choose to enhance
its **independent military capabilities**, but it will have little
interest in using these capabilities to support the US' influence
attempts toward China; instead, it will utilize the capabilities to
advance a more **independent foreign policy**.]{.underline}
Alternatively, [the ally may hedge by **accommodating** China. In this
case, the ally may make unilateral concessions in an attempt to appease
China. It will also attempt to minimize its involvements in disputes
involving China]{.underline}. At times, the ally may adopt a mixed
strategy of balancing and accommodation; alternatively, it may fluctuate
between the two strategies as it seeks to determine which will prove
most successful. [Hedging behavior will create **significant problems**
for the US' influence attempts toward China]{.underline}. [A hedging
ally could adopt a **confrontational policy** that undercuts the US'
efforts to prevent an escalatory spiral]{.underline}. [China may come to
believe that the ally is acting on behalf of the US, in which case it
will **discount** the US' **assurances** and **restraint**]{.underline}.
Even if China does not believe that the US is guiding the ally's hedging
behavior, [an escalatory spiral between the ally]{.underline} [and China
creates a heightened **risk of war** that would **entangle** the
US.]{.underline} [An ally that is pursuing accommodative hedging may
offer little resistance to China's attempts to alter the status quo,
undercutting the US' **deterrence efforts**.]{.underline} Even if the
ally pursues a balancing strategy that emphasizes a more confrontational
approach toward China, [it will be unlikely to contribute its
**resources** to support the US' deterrence efforts beyond the ally's
own territory.]{.underline} Similarly, [a hedging ally will be unlikely
to contribute to the US' efforts in **compellence**. An ally engaged in
accommodative hedging might reinforce China's incentives to resist
changes to the status quo]{.underline}. Alternatively, [an ally engaged
in balancing might **complicate compellence** by withdrawing support for
the US' inducements toward China.]{.underline} A [strategy that reduces
alliance coordination should also have direct effects on the US'
**influence attempts** to deter or compel China. If the US reduces its
commitment to its ally, it may signal to China that the US' **resolve
has diminished**. China may come to doubt the US' resolve to impose
costs in deterrence or sustain punishments in compellence.

### Taiwan General Links

#### \*\*\*Taiwan arms sale signify assurance

**Thompson 7/15**/19 (Drew Thompson, former US Defense Department
official responsible for managing bilateral relations with China, Taiwan
and Mongolia, "US arms sales shows Taiwan's security is non-tradeable to
the US and key to its Indo-Pacific strategy", South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3018242/us-arms-sales-shows-taiwans-security-non-tradeable-us-and-key-its)

The Trump administration has notified the United States Congress of its
intent to sell 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and Stinger missiles worth US\$2.2
billion to Taiwan. [While China has predictably reacted with outrage,
this latest arms sale reflects rational calculations by Taipei and
Washington, which concluded that this sale is firmly in their respective
interests.]{.underline}

[Importantly, the notification makes clear that Taiwan's security is not
trade-bait in a grand bargain between Washington and Beijing, but a
notable indicator that the Trump administration is faithfully
implementing its Indo-Pacific strategy.]{.underline}

Taiwan's rationale to acquire new tanks and the air defences to protect
them is clear. China's military has modernised and expanded rapidly and
President Xi Jinping has openly declared that the use of force to
reunify Taiwan with the mainland remains a policy option.

[Investments by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in amphibious
vessels, heavy lift aircraft, attack helicopters, as well as long-range
strike capabilities, make the invasion of Taiwan an increasingly
realistic threat.]{.underline} [To counter the PLA threat, it is
necessary for Taiwan to modernise its legacy force and develop new
asymmetric capabilities.]{.underline}

M1 Abrams tanks and Stingers, an improvement over the existing M60
Patton tanks bought in 1991, are intelligent military choices and an
integral component of Taiwan's "Overall Defence Concept". The vision, by
Taiwan's Chief of the General Staff Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, emphasises
asymmetric and innovative capabilities, mobility and survivability, and
maximising Taiwan's defensive advantages by improving its littoral
fighting capabilities. [Taiwan's success at turning it into a
full-fledged military strategy and doctrine will be critical to its
ability to deter Beijing.]{.underline}

[The sale is also a substantial indication to allies and partners in the
region about US commitment, dependability and willingness to stand up to
China on behalf of valued partners.]{.underline} It underpins the US
Indo-Pacific strategy, which emphasises deepening relationships and
improving the military capabilities of partners and allies.

Beijing undoubtedly sees this and the US Indo-Pacific strategy in a
different light, but that perspective misses the essence of the
calculus.

[The Trump administration's decision to sell tanks to Taiwan while
negotiating the US trade relationship with China reflects confidence,
and a relentless focus on US interests. It should also debunk theories
that the US is using Taiwan to contain or impair China.]{.underline}

President Donald Trump made concessions to President Xi at the G20
summit in Osaka, Japan, to relieve US pressure on Huawei, purportedly to
build trust and support the US bargaining position in bilateral trade
negotiations. [This makes sense. Trading Taiwan's security for economic
concessions does not. Taiwan's security, deterring China's use of force,
and the peaceful resolution of the cross-strait conflict are key
American interests that cannot and should not be traded for soybeans or
market access.]{.underline}

Taiwan arms sales have always been a factor in the US-China
relationship, and will continue to be central because until China
renounces the use of force and exclusively pursues peaceful means for
reconciliation, it remains squarely in the US national interest to
ensure that Taiwan can defend itself and manage cross-strait relations
from a position of relative security.

This concept of supporting choices that promote long-term peace and
prosperity is at the core of the Indo-Pacific strategy. The US Defence
Department's report on the Indo-Pacific strategy, released to coincide
with the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in early June, stated it
succinctly: "The United States has a vital interest in upholding the
rules-based international order", which "includes a strong, prosperous
and democratic Taiwan".

[The US will undoubtedly have more opportunities to demonstrate its
commitment to Taiwan's security and the defence of allies and
partners.]{.underline} Taiwan has requested new F-16V fighter aircraft
to replace its ageing F-5 fighters, and that decision is reportedly
pending.

[The Taiwan factor in the US-China relationship will continue to be
manageable so long as the Trump administration focuses on its interests
and continues to recognise that Taiwan's security is not a tradeable
commodity, but an integral aspect of its Indo-Pacific
strategy.]{.underline}

#### Taiwan can and will proliferate if the US no longer protects it via arms sales

[Although it is highly unlikely that Taiwan will again seek nuclear
weapons, this possibility cannot be ruled out. The security condition
that sparked the nuclear-weapons pursuit in 1964 and that sustained it
for more than two decades -- a looming potential threat from the
mainland -- remains the dominant risk in Taiwan's security
landscape]{.underline}. While crossStrait relations have improved, the
military balance has steadily worsened. [**[To the extent that Taiwan
enjoys de facto protection from the US, it does not need to consider a
nuclear equaliser.]{.mark} Two conditions thus could prompt
reconsideration. [If the threat perception were to become sufficiently
dire and the US could not be counted upon to deter mainland
China]{.mark}, then [Taiwan would have a logical motivation to seek an
autonomous A-bomb]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Even then, however, the risks
would probably be judged to be too great in terms of the provocation to
Beijing. Some analysts claim that if Taiwan decided to produce nuclear
weapons, it would take eight to ten years66 or longer.67 Such estimates
apparently assume a systematic development effort, similar to the past
programmes of Pakistan and North Korea. Those countries had time for a
measured approach since they did not face an imminent existential
threat. [If, on the contrary, Taiwan's security circumstances were so
dire as to prompt a weaponisation decision, the government would need to
embark on a crash course. Such an emergency programme that mobilised the
nation's top talent and prioritised speed over safety could perhaps
produce crude weapons **within two years**.]{.underline} For a crash
programme, the plutonium route would be quicker than uranium
enrichment[. **[Taiwan learned the essentials of reprocessing 40
years]{.mark} a**go, while the enrichment programme in the 1980s never
got beyond laboratory level]{.underline}. Although the two key
scientists who led the plutonium Taiwan \| 143 programme are deceased,
others who assisted in ancillary roles could be brought out of
retirement to help jump-start a programme. While little is left of the
former reprocessing related facilities, the documentation is presumably
preserved somewhere. [Building a reprocessing plant might take up to one
year. Weapons design work would proceed in tandem, and might be
accelerated by foreign weapons designers.]{.underline} Weapons
fabrication might then take several more months. Because Taiwan's
land-attack missiles are small in diameter and thus unsuitable for crude
A-bombs, the weapons would have to be designed for air drop, or possibly
suicidal delivery via water.68 Such a crash course could not be kept
secret from IAEA inspectors, the Taiwan public or outside powers. A
uranium enrichment programme would be easier to hide, but probably still
impossible to keep secret given the porous nature of Taiwan politics and
the openness of society. Taiwan has no known uranium resources and
importing the necessary uranium would itself be difficult to keep under
wraps. The cost of a Manhattan Project-style weapons programme,
estimated at up to US\$10 bn,69 also could not be kept confidential.

#### United States -- Taiwan relations key to prevent Taiwan developing nuclear capabilities

The Chang incident threw INER into disarray. Many INER researchers
suddenly lost their raison d\'etre. [Although the United States took
decisive measures to end Taiwan\'s nuclear weapon program, it did not
ask (or allow) the INER to disband]{.underline}. What explains the
United States\' mixed response? One view is that the United States
regarded these researchers with concern, so having them in one place
facilitated monitoring and control and prevented \"proliferation\" of
nuclear manpower.17 Another view is that the United States wanted
[Taiwan to maintain some kind of \"near-nuclear capability\" by
retaining these researchers\' expertise.]{.underline} An author of
Taiwan\'s Defense White Paper, Chien Chung, opined that The United
States wanted Taiwan to \"keep the engine warm and await further
instructions\" (nuanji daiming). He estimates that there are still over
800 \"national treasures\" today. He notes: \"It would have been quite
easy to totally dissolve Taiwan\'s nuclear manpower; just give all these
people U.S. passports! This is one reason why, although it is difficult
to obtain the material, Taiwan\'s capability to research and develop
nuclear weapons can never be completely ruled out.\"18 [The key is U.S.
interests and attitudes. T]{.underline}he George W. Bush
administration\'s forceful approach toward the nuclear challenges posed
by Iraq, North Korea, and Iran notwithstanding, if changing national
interests due to geopolitical shifts (e.g., if the United States sees
China as the main threat) require that the United States choose a
reliable nuclear partner or proxy with sufficient technological
capabilities and compatible national values, Chung thinks Taiwan is a
good choice. The concern, however, is that a nuclear-capable Taiwan may
become intransigent in disputes with China due to its confidence in
America\'s support, causing the United States to lose escalation control
in a conflict with China. Entrapment thus becomes plausible for the
United States. The third lesson is that [**Taiwan\'s deep dependence on
the U.S. security commitment gave the United States exceptional leverage
over Taiwan\'s nuclear aspirations.** Taiwan\'s dependence on the United
States is more acute than that of Japan]{.underline} and South Korea. It
is no longer under explicit treaty protection of the United States and
U.S. support for Taiwan would have to factor in China\'s reaction.
[**This gives the United States unusually large leverage over Taiwan\'s
nuclear aspirations. For the foreseeable future, the United States can
manage Taiwan\'s nuclear pro- gram using a mixed strategy of preventing
proliferatio**n]{.underline}, maintaining near-nuclear capability, and
sharing the fruits of peaceful use of nuclear energy. [Needing access to
international markets and nuclear technology, dependent on the United
States, and concerned about China\'s possible preemptive strike,
Taiwan\'s best choice was and is nuclear restraint.]{.underline}

### Taiwan Grand Bargain Link

#### Taiwan will proliferate if it thinks the US has abandoned it---ending arms sales will cause this, cascades to Japan and South Korea

**Fitzpatrick 16** (Mark Fitzpatrick, Adelphi Series Journal Issue 455:
Asia's Latent Nuclear Powers: Japan, South Korea and Taiwan "Taiwan",
2/5/16,
[[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19445571.2015.1146023?needAccess=true]{.underline}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19445571.2015.1146023?needAccess=true),
RKK)

As noted earlier[, **fear of abandonment by the US is the other factor
that, in conjunction with fear of the mainland, could possibly again
push Taiwan down the nuclear path as an option to replace US
protection**.]{.underline} Indeed, there could be reasons to question
Washington's willingness to come to Taiwan's assistance in the future.
One reason is Beijing's growing importance to the US in almost every
area of economic and transnational policy, from non-proliferation to
climate change. Washington insists that the China relationship will not
lead to abandoning Taiwan \| 149 allies. Yet [some American commentators
have called for stopping arms sales to Taiwan in exchange for Beijing's
cooperation on other issues of greater geopolitical
importance]{.underline}.89 In fact, Taiwan today does not have a formal
US defence guarantee. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which
replaced the 1954 defence treaty following the termination of diplomatic
relations, is ambiguous. It declares it is the policy of the US to
'consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than
peaceful means ... a threat to the peace and security of the Western
Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States', to provide
Taiwan with 'arms of a defensive character', and to 'maintain the
capacity of the US to resist any resort to force or other forms of
coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people on Taiwan'. This falls far short of the previous
commitment for military assistance under the 1954 defence treaty, even
though commitments under the latter were not airtight, either.90 US
president Bill Clinton in 2004 acknowledged that the US 'had never said
whether we would or wouldn't come to the defence of Taiwan if it were
attacked'.91 When the US in 2001 designated Taiwan as the equivalent of
a major non-NATO ally, it allowed Taiwan to submit military equipment
requests at any time, rather than annually, but it did not otherwise
change the nature of the relationship. And there has been no
follow-through on a 2001 commitment to help Taiwan acquire modern
submarines, of import partly because the US no longer manufactures
diesel submarines and because other states that do so are unwilling to
suffer Beijing's ire.92 Although the TRA has sometimes been interpreted
to mean that the US will defend Taiwan in the case of an attack, this is
not necessarily the case[. To the extent that US deterrence covers
Taiwan it is a de facto, not de jure, commitment, and and Taiwan
therefore more amenable to change. There is nothing close to a Taiwan
equivalent of the extended deterrence consultations that the US holds
with Japan and South Korea. Taiwan is hardly even mentioned in many
American analytical discussions of extended deterrence]{.underline}.93
As a 2010 policy paper explained, extended deterrence is a latent issue
in the Taiwan case, 'subsumed by the larger question of whether the
United States would come to the island's defence at all'.94 Think tanks
find it difficult to obtain funding from US governmental and
philanthropic foundations for research or Track II events on extended
deterrence for Taiwan. The topic is considered too sensitive. [One last
factor that could also contribute to a Taiwan nuclear push would be a
breakdown in the global non-proliferation regime**. If Japan or South
Korea were to go nuclear in response to Chinese and North Korean
threats, there would be fewer inhibitions on Taiwan doing so as
well.**]{.underline} In such a circumstance, the NPT would be a dead
letter. The causation for such a domino effect would not be direct:
Japanese or South Korean nuclear weapons would pose no threat to Taiwan.
[But since these allies would only seek nuclear weapons in the event of
no longer being able to rely on US protection, there would also be a
loss of credibility regarding lingering US commitments to not-quite-ally
Taiwan.]{.underline}

Abandoning Taiwan would erode American credibility in the Indo-Pacific
and add fuel to an ongoing regional arms race. [Taiwan policy cannot be
compartmentalized, and viewed in isolation from the pivot]{.underline}
and U.S. policy towards Asia. Decision-makers in [[Seoul, Tokyo, and
Manila would]{.mark} naturally [question]{.mark} U.S. resolve and
[Washington's commitment to their security]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
event of an abandonment of Taiwan. [Japan]{.underline}, in particular,
[would feel threatened]{.underline} \[21\] [by the stationing of Chinese
forces on Taiwan]{.underline}---in essence losing a valuable
geopolitical buffer---in such close proximity to its southwestern
approaches. [Heightened threat perceptions in Tokyo, if combined with a
lack of faith in the credibility of U.S. conventional and nuclear
deterrence, could lead Japan to acquire a nuclear-weapons
capability]{.underline}. The corrosive effect of forfeiting [[Taiwan
would]{.mark} also [extend to other key allies]{.mark} such as South
Korea, which might question Washington's determination [to defend it
from North Korean aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, recent
public-opinion polls have indicated that a [growing proportion of the
South Korean public now favors the development of a South Korean nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. Revealingly, the [reasons invoked]{.underline}
\[22\] [for such a shift were growing concerns over North Korea's
increasingly unpredictable and belligerent behavior]{.underline}, [as
well as over the continued viability of the United States' security
guarantee]{.underline}. Meanwhile, smaller regional states might find
themselves both disinclined to place their faith in the United States,
and cowed into submission by a more self-assured and advantageously
positioned China. An [[abandonment of Taiwan could]{.mark} thus [lead
to]{.mark} a]{.underline} creeping Finlandization \[23\]---or [[rapid
nuclearization]{.mark}---of large tracts of the Indo-Pacific, and, in
time, to the sunset of American primacy in Asia. Taiwan, therefore, most
certainly matters.]{.underline}

[[Abandoning]{.mark} staunch, long-time friend like [Taiwan would damage
US credibility in the eyes of other regional
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Glaser argues that in the case of
Japan, this damage would be containable. Tokyo realizes that compared to
Taipei, its relationship with Washington is more strongly
institutionalized. Japan also has nowhere else to go, he says, other
than sticking with the United States. This is probably true, although
[US abandonment of Taiwan [would reinforce Japan's fear regarding the
long-term US reliability to stand up to a strengthening China]{.mark}.
This would embolden Japanese advocates of accommodating China, as well
as those who call for a militarily strong Japan unleashed from the
alliance. What about the [damage to the reputation of the US among

mentions only Tokyo, the relatively easy case.]{.underline}

### Taiwan BMD Link

#### Taiwan wants missile defense systems from the US to reassure their people

**Swaine and Runyon 2,** (Michael D. Swaine, senior associate and
codirector of the China Program at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, Loren H. Runyon, senior intern at the National
Bureau of Asian Research, "Ballistic Missiles and Missile Defense in
Asia", 2002, <https://carnegieendowment.org/files/swainenbr.pdf>, RKK)

[Taiwan supports the development and deployment of a lower-tier TMD
system]{.underline}, despite recent indications of slow movement in this
direction, [and probably favors the eventual acquisition of an
upper-tier capability as wel]{.underline}l, even though some observers
harbor serious doubts about the latter's cost, feasibility, and likely
provocative affect on Chinese behavior. [Taipei has already acquired
Patriot (PAC-2) missile systems from the United States and has
**received U.S. approval to acquire many elements of the PAC-3 system**.
In addition, the **U.S. Congress has introduced legislation proposing
strengthened U.S.-Taiwan TMD cooperation**.]{.underline} Taiwan has also
developed and is deploying two indigenous TMD-capable systems---the Tien
Kung1 and -2 SAMs. These are radar-guided, able to track objects up to
200 and 300 km respectively, and described by Taiwanese defense
officials as equivalent to the U.S. Patriot air-defense missile. In
addition to these two systems, Taiwan is also reportedly developing a
more advanced, dedicated lower-tier, anti-tactical ballistic missile
(ATBM) system to augment a future U.S. PAC-3 system.125 Finally, Taiwan
is reportedly developing an early-warning radar system to support these
systems and is considering acquiring a long-range radar from the United
States.126 [Taipei has three primary motivations for seeking to acquire
TMD systems. First, the upgraded Patriot system (PAC-3) and BMD-equipped
AEGIS ships would provide Taiwan with a limited but significant
capability against China's ballistic missiles, thereby contributing to
the overall effort to deter Beijing from employing force. Second, **the
deployment of TMD systems would provide psychological reassurance to the
people of Taiwan.** Passive defense measures alone (such as the
hardening of possible targets and various civil defense efforts) would
not provide the same degree of reassurance as would the purchase of TMD
systems from the United States. Third, and more important than the
military dimensions of TMD acquisitions**, Taipei has strong political
motives to acquire a U.S.-manufactured TMD system**. Indeed, **many
experts believe that the acquisition of TMD, from Taipei's perspective,
has less to do with addressing the threat posed by China's ballistic
missiles than with providing tangible evidence of U.S. support for the
defense of Taiwan, and especially closer U.S.-Taiwan defense
relation**s.]{.underline}127 At the same time, as a recent report on
ballistic missile defense in Asia by the Stimson Center states, there
has been little public debate in Taiwan (until recently) about whether
TMD should be sought from the United States, what priority should be
attached to acquiring TMD systems, and which systems should be
purchased. It has been difficult for politicians in Taiwan to speak out
against acquiring a system that may be capable of protecting Taiwan from
China's missiles---even if the specific system happens to be a poor fit
for Taiwan.128 Nonetheless, doubts remain about various aspects of TMD
systems. Taiwanese politicians remain sensitive to possible Chinese
reactions to the acquisition of TMD systems by Taiwan, especially
upper-tier versions. Members of the legislature regularly question the
cost and utility of expensive and vulnerable early warning radars and
lower-tier systems, although few understand the technical and financial
aspects of the issue. Among some in the elite, lower- and especially
upper-tier systems are regarded as unproven, provocative, and expensive.
Moreover, while most military officers support the idea of missile
defense on a political or psychological level, many are extremely
skeptical of the military effectiveness of the proposed systems, for
several reasons. First, missile defense in Taiwan faces greater
operational challenges and must meet higher expectations than
counterpart systems in the United States or Japan, considering the size,
sophistication, and proximity of the Chinese ballistic missile force.
Second, there is widespread concern that the announcement of the sale by
the U.S. of upper-tier systems to Taiwan could provoke Beijing to launch
a preemptive strike. Third, many military officers are wary of the costs
of missile defense and worry that the systems will decimate their
already insufficient 127 Stimson Report, p. vii. 128 Ibid, p. xi.
Taiwan's politicians find it difficult to speak out against a TMD system
that may protect Taiwan from China's missiles---even if the specific
system happens to be a poor fit for Taiwan. 66 NBR ANALYSIS procurement
budgets. For this reason, many officers want Taiwan to put greater
efforts into developing less expensive indigenous TMD systems. The
indigenous ATBM system mentioned above could eventually supplant a
planned PAC-3 system in parts of Taiwan.129

### Taiwan Spillover

#### The plan destroys alliances with Japan and South Korea---causes an arms race and wrecks US influence in the region

[Washington's long-term support for Taiwan also has significance for
U.S. allies and friends. Asian countries which look to the United States
to balance China's rising power may not want Washington to squander
resources and energy on Taiwan, but were it to conversely ignore
Taiwan's security, they would see their own safety threatened**. U.S.
credibility, therefore, is at stake**. **U.S. inconstancy could convince
American allies and friends to rely less on Washington, undertake an
arms race, and/or bandwagon with China**.]{.underline} After the Clinton
administration dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area
around Taiwan in the 1995--- 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, the region's
confidence in the United States soared and a wave of counterbalancing
against China occurred. Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and other
nations all bolstered their security ties with the United States.
Forsaking Taiwan would likely have the opposite effect. [A U.S. decision
to abandon Taiwan leading to unification of an unwilling Taiwan with
China would be particularly alarming to Japan. Tension between China and
Japan remains high, and the resolution of chronic economic, security,
and history problems in the foreseeable future appears
unlikely]{.underline}. Dependent on sea lanes of supply and
communication which pass close to Taiwan, [Tokyo would consider itself
to be more vulnerable, and it would be]{.underline}. Japan would also be
outflanked should China decide to use Taiwan as a military platform.
[Contested claims to oil fields and islands in the East and South China
Seas would be more difficult to defend]{.underline}. **[If Japan began
to doubt U.S. reliability, that could deal a fatal blow to the
U.S.---Japan alliance]{.underline}**. Moreover, adding to Japan's
dismay, [South Korea, increasingly reliant on its burgeoning economic
ties with China, might calculate that if the United States can sever
ties to Taiwan, Seoul could be safer renouncing its security alliance
with Washington and aligning with Beijing]{.underline}. The current urge
to seek protection against a potentially powerful and abusive China has
made the United States more welcome across Southeast Asia. Aware that
they cannot effectively hedge against China without U.S. collaboration,
Southeast Asian nations have quietly repaired rifts and reinvigorated
cooperation with Washington. They welcomed Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton's declaration in Thailand in 2009 that ''the United States is
back'' in Asia. Although they don't share Tokyo's view of Taiwan's
geostrategic importance, they do worry about freedom of navigation and
resource claims in the South China Sea. [They would likely interpret a
shift in U.S. policy away from Taiwan as a signal of U.S. surrender to
Chinese interests, and eventually follow suit.]{.underline}

experts are scrutinizing every Trump utterance about South Korea, trade
and security made during the campaign, and they don't like what they
find. As I have been asked repeatedly during my stay here, does he
really believe that the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement kills American
jobs, that South Korea does not contribute substantially to the costs of
basing our soldiers here, or that South Korea and Japan should defend
themselves against the "maniac of North Korea," including by acquiring
their own nuclear weapons? A similar frightened discussion about the
credibility of the United States' commitments is occurring in Japan,
Australia and most countries in the NATO alliance. In conversations,
emails and public statements I get from foreign policy officials from
Estonia to Canada, the question is always the same: Does Trump really
believe all the crazy things he said on the campaign trail about our
allies? Historically, [uncertainty never enhances
alliances.]{.underline} As a candidate, Trump suggested that his
unpredictability could increase his negotiating leverage, keeping those
on the other side of the table guessing as to what he might do next.
That strategy might work when negotiating construction contracts and may
even be effective in deliberations with foes, but it does not work with
allies. Above all else, [uncertainty about our security commitments to
our allies tempts our competitors]{.underline}. [We don't want Russia
challenging our commitments to our NATO allies, North Korea poking at
our fortitude to defend the Republic of Korea or China testing the
waters about our staying power in Asia.]{.underline} As his first order
of business regarding foreign policy, President Trump should reset
relations with all U.S. allies before thinking about a reset with Russia
or anyone else. Reassuring allies in Europe and Asia is actually
low-hanging fruit: Three signals could change the negative dynamics in
our alliance relationships overnight. First, President Trump could state
clearly that our resolve to defend our allies is not conditioned by what
our allies pay us for security. Alliances are not protection rackets.
Early in his administration, [President Trump could add credibility to
his statements by expressing support for recently announced but not yet
implemented enhancements of our defense commitments to our allies, such
as the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
missile defense system in South Korea or the \$3.4 billion increase in
defense spending planned for Europe to enhance our contributions to NATO
deterrence against Russia.]{.underline} In the second paragraph of such
reassurance statements, Trump could then affirm his desire to pursue new
burden-sharing arrangements with our allies. Regarding our Asian allies,
he could start that conversation by acknowledging the facts about the
serious expenditures that Japan and South Korea already provide to
underwrite the costs of U.S. troop deployments in these two countries.
Doing so would create the permissive conditions for renegotiations about
upping their share. Regarding NATO, Trump could simply reaffirm existing
policy; every ally should spend 2 percent of its budget on defense. No
one would balk, incremental change would begin to happen, and Trump
could declare victory. Second, to further reset relations with our
allies, President Trump should moderate his hostile campaign
pronouncements about free trade. Here in Seoul, business and government
leaders fear the negative consequences for the South Korean economy of
45 percent tariffs on all Chinese goods, since Korean companies provide
many of the parts for products assembled in China that are then sold to
the United States. More generally, all of our allies in Europe and Asia
would suffer from global economic declines triggered by a trade war
between the two largest economies in the world. Trump needs to back away
from these extreme ideas, which are gross violations of our own World
Trade Organization obligations, and instead take a more pragmatic,
evolutionary and cooperative approach. Trump also could reassure allies
in Europe and Asia by continuing, not stopping, negotiations over the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with our European
partners and agreeing to explore amendment --- not complete abandonment
--- of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in Asia. Prematurely walking
away from the TPP full stop would be particularly insulting and
destabilizing to our Asian partners who have already signed the
agreement. President Trump must understand that our retreat from the TPP
would create a vacuum for China to fill with its own Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Third, President Trump could utter
the words "democracy," "freedom" or "liberty" when describing what makes
our alliances special. As one senior Korean official told me this week,
"Trump only talks about money, and never about values." It might be too
much to hope that President Trump might commit to promoting democracy
abroad, but at least he could pledge to defend democracy abroad[. Unlike
some other foreign policy rethinks, signaling support for our alliances
would not alienate Trump's core electoral constituencies. On the
contrary, public opinion polls show deep support for our alliances among
the American people. And a reset with our allies would be cheap,
requiring mostly rhetorical statements, confirming existing commitments
and adding very few new resources.]{.underline} So, for an easy and
early win in his new administration, President Trump should focus first
on resetting relations with our allies; Russia can wait.

[The theory developed in this chapter presents an explanation of foreign
policy based on a **symbolic signaling mechanism**.]{.underline} [States
can, and often do, send signals that rely on **symbols**, rather than
**costly actions**, and these signals matter because they have
observable effects on states' foreign policy behaviors]{.underline}.
This type of signaling occupies the middle ground between the extremes
of costly action and cheap talk: [signals can come from social
relationships and symbolic goods.1]{.underline}19 [Weapons
transfers]{.underline} are not so exceptional that they are rare signals
in international politics, nor are they so commonplace as to lose
signaling meaning. They [are instead common enough to be **broadly
comprehensible**, but rare enough to have **real foreign policy
effects**]{.underline}. Scholarship on signaling needs to be sensitive
to context and contingency, and to the importance of shared meanings and
understandings. Future research can identify other contexts where actors
use social relationships and symbols to send political signals; I would
suggest this type of signaling is not confined to weapons transfers, nor
is it unique to international security.120 [This theory also
demonstrates the importance of political relationships in explaining
foreign policy and international security. Foreign policy is a
**complex** and **dynamic process**, in which the past affects the
present and the present will affect the futur]{.underline}e. To pull a
dyad out of its historical and social context is to strip away
relationships that matter for determining a state's foreign policy
choices. Further, states beyond the sender-receiver dyad matter.
[Whether through **establishing hierarchies**, or signaling to the
receiver's **adversaries**, weapons transfers affect and are affected by
the policies in multiple states. Relationships are not exogenous to
behavior, nor is behavior exogenous to relationships.1]{.underline}21
[The emphasis on relationships throughout this project also shows just
how much effort it takes to maintain them.]{.underline} [Maintaining
relationships takes **work**, because **the giver must constantly feed
the ravenous beast.**]{.underline} Finally, [by treating arms as both
**military tool and symbol**, this chapter shows the promise of linking
materialist and constructivist approaches to international security.
A]{.underline}ddressing both dimensions of weapons shows that
perceptions of relative power are a function of both military
capabilities and relationships with other states. [Weapons transfers
serve the **vital role** of **signaling** and **clarifying** these
political relationships.]{.underline} Combined with the focus on
relationships, this work shows how [international actors use **symbols**
and **signals** to make and unmake relations that constitute world
politics.]{.underline}

#### Transfer of [prestigious weapons]{.underline} is [critical]{.underline} to alliance signaling.

[I observed the importance of perceptions in creating **prestige**
during fieldwork at two international weapons shows]{.underline}. Many
manufacturers tried to portray their weapons as particularly important
by unveiling them at a designated time during the show, drawing
significant crowds and creating an air of excitement by pumping music
through nearby speakers, or using security ropes to allow only important
visitors -- usually in military uniforms or other official-looking
attendees -- nearest to the weapon. During an outdoor demonstration of a
number of weapons, the "coolness" factor of an armored vehicle was
enhanced through a hard rock soundtrack. The tempo of the music was used
to manipulate the audience's perceptions of the weapon on display, and
varied based on how much perceptions of different weapons needed to be
manipulated.72 More mundane weapons, like a firetruck and a fueling
vehicle, were accompanied by explosions, to get the audience to pay
attention and to associate these weapons with the battlefield, rather
than support roles. Throughout the convention halls, brochures touted
specific capabilities or linked a particular weapon to a known
prestigious weapon. For example, Finnish arms company Patria emphasized
its integration of weapons systems in its Armored Modular Vehicle as
providing "the digital backbone for 21st century soldiers," perhaps
trying to portray this armored vehicle -- usually not very
technologically sophisticated -- as at the technological cutting edge,
and thus prestigious. [The concept of prestige is not reducible to the
economic cost of the weapons transfer. First, states often give weapons
at free or significantly discounted rates to friends and
allies]{.underline}. [Second, there is no agreed upon way to calculate
cost.]{.underline} For example, the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon,
produced by Raytheon, has an acquisition cost of \$3.3 billion. But
because the Navy and Air Force ordered 12,000 missiles the per-unit
production cost is \$246,585.73 By contrast, General Dynamic's M1A1
Abrams Tank has a per-unit cost of \$2.38 million.74 The Abrams tank,
though a useful main battle tank, was first produced in the 1970s, where
as the JSOW is a brand-new missile. Determining prestige based on cost
would be misleading in this case. [Further, some transfer agreements
include contracts for maintenance and/or spare parts. This would
increase the value of the transfer, but would not indicate anything
about prestige.75 Prestige is a **heuristic** used by a variety of
actors to make inferences about the **future relationship** between the
sending and receiving states.]{.underline} This heuristic suggests that
[higher prestige weapons signify a **greater relationship** to come;
states woo one another with the prettiest, most attention-grabbing
weapons.]{.underline} Different types of weapons -- like gifts between
two individuals -- reflect the weight of the relationship, and change in
type and/or amount as the closeness between the states changes.76
[Weapons are certainly valuable for their military functions, but the
symbol of prestigious weapons is a way of **distinguishing allies from
non-allies**,77 can be an invitation to a **closer relationship**,78 and
is an expression of the sender's **perception** of the
receiver]{.underline}.79 [Prestigious weapons are a **visible signal**
of **commitment** and **interest**, and states are therefore more
circumspect in transferring these weapons]{.underline}. Less prestigious
weapons are more likely to be transferred because they don't signal a
deep commitment; they are one of the means states have for expressing
potential interest. Low prestige doesn't mean that the weapon is devoid
of use: support weapons like transport aircraft or armored personnel
carriers are essential for both offensive and defensive operations. But
[because every state that has a functioning military needs to pay
attention to the "tail" in the tooth-to-tail ratio, the transfer of low
prestige weapons is not nearly as noticeable and does not **constitute a
political relationship** in the same way as high prestige
weapons.]{.underline} Treating prestige as a heuristic is in line with
the cognitive psychology literature that reminds us that [individuals
use heuristic principles to reduce the complex task of assessing
probability and predicting outcomes, especially in situations of high
uncertainty]{.underline}.80 [Weapons prestige functions as a
**representative** and an **availability heuristic**: it is the cue by
which states reduce complex inputs about the future]{.underline}.81 In
this case, cognitive psychology applies as much to the state as to
individuals. [States are composed of individuals, and we know that
people reflect on their lifetime of experiences in making associations
between particular actions as part of a larger class of actions.82 This
process should be compounded in states because of both institutional and
national memories]{.underline}: while an individual will rely on events
from her lifetime, states institutions and bureaucracies effectively
increase the "lifetime" of events on which individuals can rely for
making these judgments. Further, [the actors involved as the individual,
bureaucratic, and state-level decision-making process are especially
attentive to **signaling** and **intentions**, increasing the salience
of this heuristic. Prestige, then, is a **perceptually determined
assessment** of weapons, that draws on technology, firepower, and the
status of states that use the weapon.]{.underline}

### Taiwan I/L -- Spillover 

#### Abandoning Taiwan signals [American weakness]{.underline} and [eviscerates]{.underline} global [alliances]{.underline} and [cooperation]{.underline}.

Shelly **Rigger 11** (Shelly Rigger, Brown Professor of Political
Science at Davidson, 11-2011, "Why Giving Up Taiwan Will Not Help Us
with China," American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,
Accessed: 07-10-2019 //kent -- wh)

[The most-cited strategic argument for continuing US security assistance
to Taiwan is that the **existing security architecture** in the
Asia-Pacific region and beyond serves the interests of many
nations]{.underline}. Within the network of global security
relationships, Washington's behavior toward Taiwan indicates its
attitude toward security assistance generally, including its alliance
commitments and willingness to honor other obligations around the world.
As retired admiral Eric McVadon said, "[**American credibility** as an
alliance partner and as a bulwark of peace and stability in the region
and around the world would be **sorely diminished** were we to abandon
the \[Taiwan Relations Act\],]{.underline} [cease support of Taipei, and
lead Beijing to conclude that it can attack Taiwan and not be
repulsed]{.underline}."6 [The system of alliances the United States
constructed in Northeast Asia after World War II and the Korean War is
not to be **discarded on a whim**.]{.underline} From 1895 to 1945 Japan,
Russia, and China battled for regional supremacy, devastating huge
swaths of Korea and China. American security guarantees put in place in
the midtwentieth century suspended those conflicts. [Ample evidence
exists in current affairs---including conflicts over contested islands
in the East and South China Seas---to suggest that **military rivalry**
could return to East Asia]{.underline}. [The US presence, however it may
offend China, actually lightens Beijing's military burden by
**restraining neighboring countries'** military investments and easing
their strategic anxiety.]{.underline} As Glaser acknowledges, "the U.S.
alliance with Japan also benefits China by enabling Japan to spend far
less on defense. Although the United States' power far exceeds Japan's,
China has seen the alliance as adding to regional stability, because it
fears Japan more than the United States."7 [Taming the military
rivalries that once ravaged Northeast Asia freed countries in the region
to pursue domestic development and provided a foundation for explosive
economic growth and a liberal economic order based on free markets and
open trade]{.underline}. [Military alliances **stabilized the
international system** while new economic and political organizations
from]{.underline} the United Nations to the World Trade Organization
nurtured nations' shared interests. This system, in which the United
States has served as chief enforcer and guarantor, secured six decades
of peace, stability, and prosperity in non-Communist Northeast Asia.
This US-led order is far from perfect. Developing countries suffered
terribly from proxy wars and economic isolation during the Cold War, and
since then new threats---from climate change to transnational
terrorism--- have appeared. Although the bipolar competition between two
superpowers has disappeared, [the need for **global cooperation** to
address economic and military challenges has not. Nations continue to
look to the United States to **provide leadership** in mobilizing that
cooperation and addressing those threats, and how the United States
**manages its relationships** with longtime friends, including Taiwan,
is an **important measure** of its commitment to that leadership
role]{.underline}. Glaser dismisses the idea that security assistance to
Taiwan helps sustain the postwar security architecture in East Asia. He
writes, "the risks of reduced U.S. credibility for protecting allies . .
. should be small, especially if any change in policy on Taiwan is
accompanied by countervailing measures."8 [Certainly, other nations
differentiate between Taiwan---which not only is not a formal US ally,
but which the US government does not even recognize as a state---and
other US defense partners. **Nonetheless**, no competent security
planner would dismiss a US retreat from a longstanding security
commitment as irrelevant, especially if it appears **driven by American
weakness.**]{.underline} [If Washington appears to be **backing away**
from its commitment to the alliances and institutions in which it has
invested so much, other governments will take that as a sign that they
may not be able to rely on US-backed **security arrangements** to ensure
their future security, forcing them to become more **competitive** and
**individualistic**.]{.underline} According to retired Army colonel and
military analyst Albert Willner, [America's friends already are **on the
alert** for signs of a decline in US commitments.]{.underline} He said
in an interview, "[There is a growing sense in the world that the US is
a **fair-weather friend,** it won't be there for the long
run]{.underline}. This causes people in many countries to maneuver ahead
of time, to get into position in anticipation of the day the US pulls
back[. If the US makes decisions regarding Taiwan that reinforce this
perception, it will have **profound implications** for our other
relationships]{.underline}." [Another strategic interest the United
States has in maintaining close ties to Taiwan rests with Taiwan's
position on the front line of China's rise. China's behavior toward
Taiwan indicates how it will perform its role as a lead actor on the
world stage]{.underline}. As Randall Schriver, a former deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, put it,
"Beijing's ambitions go beyond Taiwan, but right now, it's the Taiwan
issue that drives their military modernization, so it's very important
to us. Taiwan is a prism through which we can understand China's
evolution, and gain insights into it." Richard Bush, a leading analyst
of the US-PRC-Taiwan relationship, summarized these concerns when he
said, "[How the Taiwan Strait issue is resolved is an important test---
perhaps the **most important tes**t---of what kind of great power China
will be and of how the US will play its role as the guardian of the
international system.]{.underline}" By extension, [how the United States
and its allies treat Taiwan is an **important indicator** of what other
countries in the region can expect from Washington as the PRC's
influence expands. They may ask, if the United States acquiesces to a
rising China on the Taiwan issue, will it **also acquiesce** on issues
important to them?]{.underline}

H[ow might arms races and arms control operate differently under nuclear
multipolarity?]{.underline} In bipolar nuclear relationships, [states
considering changes to their nuclear force]{.underline}s and posture
would have to make judgements about whether such changes [might provoke
an adversary]{.underline} to respond, **[[potentially instigating an
arms race and making the initial state less
secure]{.underline}]{.mark}**.8 [Under nuclear multipolarity, these
calculations are complicated by the possibility of **[multiple states
reacting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Several dynamics are possible. First,
[a single change at one end of the multipolar order could trickle
[**throughout** **the** **system**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, it
is conceivable that as Russia moves nuclear weapons to the center of its
military doctrine and strategy that the United States may respond by
developing more flexible nuclear and nonnuclear strike options and
missile defenses. [These changes in Washington may cause Beijing to fear
that its retaliatory capability is being placed at risk, leading China
to gradually expand and modernize its strategic forces]{.underline}.
[Such a move could then spur India to build up its forces]{.underline}
to maintain an assured retaliatory capability vis-à-vis China, [which
could then prompt alterations in Pakistan's strategy.]{.underline} It is
also possible of course that changes could flow in the other direction.
Pakistan's nuclear warfighting approach may instigate amendments to
Indian strategy and capabilities with an effect that could be felt in
Beijing and, eventually, Washington and Moscow.9 Second, [to the degree
that one or more states occupy a central role in the nuclear order due
to the existence of multiple nuclear adversaries or allies, a single
change to posture and strategy, even in a peripheral state, could lead
to [**arms race dynamics**]{.mark} that **[engulf multiple states
simultaneously]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[If North Korea]{.underline}**,
a single U.S. rival, [were to make improvements to its nuclear
capabilities,]{.underline} for example, [Washington may seek to respond
by developing new capabilities]{.underline}, such as missile defense
systems, to defend against attacks emanating from Pyongyang. But in so
doing, [Washington's capabilities may begin to call into question the
survivability of arsenals in Russia and China, **[provoking an arms
buildup in those two countries]{.mark}.**]{.underline} If, on the other
hand, the United States refrains from responding, **[[South Korea and
Japan may question the strength of U.S. extended deterrence guarantees
and develop independent nuclear arsenals]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this
example, the allied decision is about initiating a nuclear weapons
production program, but in theory it could also include decisions about
enhancements to an existing arsenal. Indeed, this discussion brings to
light a dilemma that centrally located states in multipolar nuclear
orders face between actions that threaten to instigate arms buildup by
multiple adversaries and those that do the same for allies. These ideas
are similar to the concept advanced by others about Asia consisting of
overlapping triangles, with the United States, Russia, and China
competing in Northeast Asia and China, India, and Pakistan constituting
a similar triad in South Asia.10 The above discussion indicates,
however[, that the most important feedback loops may not be triadic but
rather a chain of linked dyads or a dynamic of four, five, or even more
states engaging nearly simultaneously.]{.underline} Of course, in order
for changes in nuclear posture to disseminate through the system,
whether in triangular or dyadic fashion, statesmen in the nuclear powers
must to some degree be disciples of Albert Wohlstetter. Wohlstetter
believed that the balance of nuclear terror was "delicate" and that
nations must continually adjust their nuclear posture to maintain an
adequate nuclear deterrence force in the face of nuclear competition
from rivals.11 His primary intellectual rival, Bernard Brodie,
disagreed.12 Brodie and those in his tradition believe that a minimal
nuclear force is sufficient for nuclear deterrence and that states thus
need not worry greatly about, or respond to, developments in adversarial
nuclear postures. If leaders of nuclear-armed states view nuclear
deterrence through a Wohlstetterian lens, it is much more likely that
developments in one nuclear state will quickly disseminate through the
system. If, however, one state is following Brodie, then the link could
be broken. At present, it appears that two states in the center of this
nuclear chain, China and India, have postures much more in line with a
Brodian perspective. This could dampen the extent of reactive arms races
in a multipolar nuclear Asia to some degree. Although such arms races
could continue to exist if developments led Beijing or New Delhi to
assess that its second-strike capabilities might be at risk, such
competition could be even more severe in the future if China or India,
or both, switched to a Wohlstetterian view on the requirements for
successful nuclear deterrence. [Multipolar nuclear relationships have
implications for both arms races and arms control.]{.underline} In a
multipolar nuclear order, [not only do bilateral nuclear arms control
agreements become less valuable, but multilateral arms control
agreements become more difficult to strike]{.underline}. As everyday
experience and international relations scholarship instruct us, the more
parties to a negotiation, the more difficult it is to reach an agreement
acceptable to all.13 Further, [bringing in more actors,]{.underline}
with more heterogeneous capabilities, [makes it less palatable and less
feasible to find agreeable symmetrical restraints.]{.underline} In
addition, for those who believe that arms control can be a strategic
tool to advance national security, in many cases it will be difficult to
divine precisely how a specific agreement would lock in national
advantages across a range of potential competitor states, especially if
the agreement includes only some, but not all, possible competitors.
Escalation and Stability **[[The most important reason to be concerned
about nuclear weapons in Asia, of course, is the threat that nuclear
weapons might be used]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To be sure, the use of
nuclear weapons remains remote, [but the probability is not zero and the
consequences could be catastrophic]{.underline}. [The
subject,]{.underline} therefore, [deserves careful
scrutiny]{.underline}. Nuclear use would overturn a 70-year tradition of
nonuse, [could result in large-scale death and destruction]{.underline},
and [might set a precedent that shapes how nuclear weapons are viewed,
proliferated, and postured decades hence]{.underline}. The [dangers of
escalation may be magnified in a multipolar nuclear order in which small
skirmishes present]{.underline} **[[the potential to quickly draw in
multiple powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, each with a finger on the
nuclear trigger. The following discussion will explore the logic of
crisis escalation and strategic stability in a multipolar nuclear
order.14 First and foremost, the [existence of multipolar nuclear powers
means that crises may pit multiple nuclear-armed states against one
another]{.underline}. This may be the result of formal planning if a
state's strategy calls for fighting multiple nuclear-armed adversaries
simultaneously. A state may choose such a strategy if it believes that a
war with one of these states would inevitably mean war with both.
Alternatively, [in a war between state A and state B, state A may decide
to conduct a preventive strike on state C for fear that it would
otherwise seek to exploit the aftermath of the war between states A and
B.]{.underline} Given U.S. nuclear strategy in the early Cold War, for
example, [it is likely that a nuclear war between the United States and
the Soviet Union would have also resulted in U.S. nuclear attacks
against China]{.underline}, even if China had not been a direct
participant in the precipitating dispute. In addition, [conflicts of
interest between nuclear powers may inadvertently impinge on the
interests of other nuclear-armed states, drawing them into
conflict]{.underline}. There is always a danger that one nuclear power
could take action against a nuclear rival and that this action would
unintentionally cross a red line for a third nuclear power, triggering a
tripartite nuclear crisis. Linton Brooks and Mira Rapp-Hooper have
dubbed this category of phenomena the "security trilemma."15 For
example, if the United States were to engage in a show of force in an
effort to signal resolve to Russia, such as the flushing of nuclear
submarines, this action could inadvertently trigger a crisis for China.
**[[There is also the issue of "catalytic" war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
This may be the first mechanism by which Cold War strategists feared
that multiple nuclear players could increase the motivations for a
nuclear exchange. [They worried that a third nuclear power, such as
China, might conduct a nuclear strike on one of the superpowers, leading
the wounded superpower to conclude wrongly that the other superpower was
responsible and thereby retaliate against an innocent state presumed to
be the aggressor]{.underline}. This outcome was seen as potentially
attractive to the third state as a way of destroying the superpowers and
promoting itself within the global power hierarchy. Fortunately, this
scenario never came to pass during the Cold War. With modern
intelligence, reconnaissance, and early warning capabilities among the
major powers, it is more difficult to imagine such a scenario today,
although this risk is still conceivable among less technologically
developed states. In addition to acting directly against one another,
nuclear powers could be drawn into smaller conflicts between their
allies and brought face to face in peak crises. [International relations
theorists discuss the concept of "chain ganging" within alliance
relationships, the dangers of which are more severe when the possibility
of nuclear escalation is present]{.underline}.16 Although this was a
potential problem even in a bipolar nuclear order, **[[the more nuclear
weapons states present, the greater the likelihood of multiple nuclear
powers entering a crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [A similar logic
suggests that the more fingers on the nuclear trigger, the more likely
it is that nuclear weapons will be used.]{.underline} Multipolar nuclear
crises are not without historical precedent.17 Several Cold War crises
featured the Soviet Union against the United States and its European
nuclear-armed allies, Britain and later France. The 1973 Arab-Israeli
War involved the United States, the Soviet Union, and a nuclear-armed
Israel. The United States has been an interested party in regional
nuclear disputes, including the Sino-Soviet border war of 1969 and
several crises in the past two decades on the Indian subcontinent.
Indeed, [many of these crises stand out as among the most dangerous of
the nuclear era.]{.underline} Some scholars argue that [the existence of
multiple nuclear powers might actually lead to international stability,
but this view has not gained much traction beyond the ivory
tower]{.underline}.18 At least one empirical study, however, shows that
multipolar nuclear crises may be less dangerous than their bipolar
counterparts.19 A statistical analysis of data from the International
Crisis Behavior Project demonstrates that crises involving nuclear
powers are more likely to end without violence and that, as the number
of nuclear powers involved increases, the probability of full-scale war
decreases. Before taking too much comfort in this finding, however, [we
must remember that the statistical research on how nuclear weapons
affect international conflict is in its infancy and has produced some
contradictory findings]{.underline}.20 Moreover, even [if the
probability of war among multiple nuclear powers is lower than between
two nuclear states or nonnuclear states, the probability is not zero,
and the consequences of any such war would potentially be much more
devastating.]{.underline}

#### Proliferation causes Asian war---goes nuclear

**Beauchamp 16** (Zack Beauchamp, senior correspondent at Vox, where he
covers global politics and ideology, and a host of Worldly, Vox\'s
podcast on foreign policy and international relations, "Trump's comments
on Japanese nukes are worrisome --- even by Trump standards", 3/31/16,
RKK)

\"If you look at the way US policy has evolved since 1945, it\'s hard to
find a policy in which US foreign policy has been more consistent than
nonproliferation,\" Mark Bell, a research fellow at Harvard\'s Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, says. \"The US, since
1945, has been extraordinarily consistent in trying to prevent other
countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.\" As Miller points out in a
2014 paper, the conventional wisdom in the early to mid--Cold War was
that nuclear weapons were very likely to spread around the world. That
was prevented, in part, by a concerted US policy effort. \"Through a mix
of bilateral diplomacy, threats of sanctions, security guarantees, and
the promotion of the NPT \[Non-Proliferation Treaty\],\" Miller writes,
\"the United States succeeded in slowing or rolling back several nuclear
programs.\" Trump would be tearing up this longstanding policy, taking a
step into the unknown. Accurately predicting the consequences is thus
essentially impossible. Were South Korea or even Japan to acquire
nuclear weapons, it\'s possible this would work out okay, deterring
Chinese and North Korean aggression without substantially altering the
region\'s security balance. Both Pakistan and India acquired nuclear
weapons, and, so far at least, it hasn\'t led to World War III. That\'s
the best case. But there are plenty of plausible worse scenarios as
well. For example, [if either country does decide to build nuclear
weapons, it will take that country some time to develop its program, and
to build enough of an arsenal to serve as a reliable deterrent. During
this time, adversaries such as China or even North Korea would have an
incentive to try to disrupt that development to maintain their nuclear
superiority. \"You have a Trump presidency \... and he decides to pull
out troops from Japan and South Korea, you have Japan and South Korea
potentially racing to develop nuclear weapons without the benefit of US
troops being there]{.underline},\" Miller says. \"[That provides a lot
of incentive for countries in the region like China or North Korea to
try to stop that process]{.underline}.\" As Bell puts it, ominously,
\"**[We\'re talking about the remote possibility of an actual nuclear
war between Japan and China]{.underline}**.\" That possibility, it is
worth stressing, is indeed extremely remote. The risk is not that, for
example, China would simply launch a nuclear war against Japan, which
would be far too dangerous and costly to be worth it. Rather, **[the
risk is that, for example, China might try to bully or threaten Japan
out of developing nuclear weapons, and that in a period of tension, this
bullying could potentially spiral out of control into a full-blown
conflict neither side actually wanted.]{.underline}** And there are
other risks. According to scholars, successful nuclear deterrence
results in something called the stability/instability paradox: [The fact
that major wars are unlikely makes countries feel safer in engaging in
small provocations against one another, knowing that nuclear deterrents
make those small provocations unlikely to escalate to full-blown war.
Consider, for instance, the South and East China Seas --- areas where
Japan, South Korea, and China have territorial disputes. If the former
two powers are nuclear-armed, and unrestrained by the United States, the
chances of low-level conflict could go up.]{.underline} \"Certainly, we
would be worried about these sort of lower-level, stability-instability
paradox type things,\" Bell says. That\'s not an exhaustive list of
things that could happen if Trump were elected and followed through on
these policies. Since no one can really know what will happen, there\'s
no sense in listing every single hypothetical possibility. These
examples, rather, illustrate just how serious the ideas we\'re
discussing are. It is very easy to detach ourselves from the potential
consequences of a Trump presidency: to see his candidacy as clownish,
and simply assume that his outlandish policy ideas would never be
implemented. But Trump is the leading Republican candidate; it is time
to take his ideas seriously. And [nothing is more serious than nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} So when Trump just throws out ideas like, \"Let
Japan and South Korea have nuclear weapons,\" with little apparent
thought about the potentially catastrophic consequences, it should worry
you. \"Things that are of that magnitude, you don\'t just word-vomit out
into the dialogue,\" Lind says. \"There\'s no sense whatsoever that he
understands what our grand strategy is.\"

#### East Asia proliferation goes nuclear

**Adams 14** (Shar Adams, writer for the Epcoh Times, citing Professor
Desmod Ball, senior defense and security expert at the Australian
National University, "Asian Cold War: Escalating Conflict in North-East
Asia Bigger Threat Than War on Terror", 10/13/14,

RKK)

The world may be focused on the "war on terror", but [the arms build up
in North-East Asia poses a far greater threat to global
stability]{.underline}, says Professor Desmond Ball, a senior defence
and security expert at the Australian National University (ANU). A
former head of ANU's Strategic & Defence Studies Centre, Professor Ball
is no lightweight when it comes to security concerns. It is Professor
Ball's expertise in command and control systems, particularly in
relation to nuclear war, that underlies his concerns about North-East
Asia. "[North-East Asia has now become the most disturbing part of the
globe]{.underline}," Prof Ball told Epoch Times in an exclusive
interview. China, Japan and South Korea -- [countries that are "economic
engines of the global economy" -- are embroiled in an arms race of
unprecedented proportions, punctuated by "very dangerous military
activities]{.underline}", he says. Unlike the arms race seen during the
Cold War, however, [there are no mechanisms in place to constrain the
military escalation in Asia]{.underline}. "Indeed, **[the escalation
dynamic could move very rapidly and strongly to large scale conflict,
including nuclear conflict]{.underline}**," said Prof Ball. "It is
happening as we watch." Military spending in Asia has grown steadily
over the last decade. According to a 2013 Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute report, China is now the world's second largest
military spender behind the United States, spending an estimated \$188
billion in 2013. Japan and South Korea are also among the world's top 10
military spenders. When North Korea and Taiwan are included, North-East
Asian countries constitute around 85 per cent of military spending in
Asia. But what is more disturbing, Prof Ball says, is the motivation for
the acquisitions. "The primary reason now for the acquisitions, whether
they are air warfare destroyers, missiles or defense submarines, is
simply to match what the other \[countries\] are getting," he said.
While he believes it is likely that Japan would have embarked on
military modernisation, he says it is China's military provocation of
countries across Asia that is fuelling the build-up. Since China lay
claim to all of the South China Sea, it has escalated territorial
disputes with Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. What started with
skirmishes between locals and Chinese fishing boats or navy vessels has
now become territorial grabs -- island building on contested rocky
outcrops. In a sign of things to come, the South China Morning Post
reported in June: "China is looking to expand its biggest installation
in the Spratly Islands into a fully formed artificial island, complete
with airstrip and sea port, to better project its military strength in
the South China Sea." According to Filipino media, the artificial island
falls within the Philippines' 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Prof
Ball says China's behaviour in the South China Sea is provocative, but
"in the scale of what we are talking about, that is nothing" compared
with conflicts in North-East Asia, where [China and Japan are contesting
claims over the Tokyo-controlled Senkaku Islands]{.underline} (claimed
as the Diaoyus by China). Of the Senkakus conflict, Prof Ball says:
"**[We are talking about actual footsteps towards nuclear war --
submarines and missiles]{.underline}**." Chinese and Japanese activity
in the Senkakus region has escalated to the point where sometimes there
are "at least 40 aircraft jostling" over the contested area, he said.
Alarm bells were set off near the Senkakus in January last year when a
Chinese military vessel trained its fire-control radar on a Japanese
naval destroyer. The incident spurred the Japanese Defense Ministry to
go public about that event and reveal another incident from a few days
prior, when a Chinese frigate directed fire-control radar at a Japanese
military helicopter. Fire-control radars are not like surveillance or
early warning radars -- they have one purpose and that is to lock onto a
target in order to fire a missile. "Someone does that to us, we fire
back," Prof Ball said. Prof Ball is recognised for encouraging openness
and transparency, and for his advocacy of multilateral institutions. He
has been called one of the region's "most energetic and activist leaders
in establishing forums for security dialogue and measures for building
confidence". In his experience visiting China over the years, however,
Prof Ball says gaining open dialogue and transparency with Chinese
military leaders is difficult. He recounted a private meeting with a
Chinese admiral shortly after the fire-control radar incident. Prof Ball
had seen direct evidence of the encounter -- "tapes of the radar
frequencies, the pulse rates and the pulse repetition frequencies" --
and wanted to know what had happened on the Chinese side and why it took
place. "In a private meeting, I asked the admiral why ... and he denied
it to my face," Prof Ball said. The Chinese admiral would not even
concede that an incident had happened. "I don't see the point of this
sort of dialogue," he added. [With so many players in the region and few
barriers against conflict escalation, the North-East Asian nuclear arms
race is now far more complex and dangerous than the Cold
War]{.underline}, he says. In the Cold War, there were mechanisms at
each level of potential confrontation, including a direct hotline
between the US and Soviet leaders. ["Once things get serious here,
\[there is\] nothing to slow things down]{.underline}. On the contrary,
you have all the incentives to go first," he said. As a key ally to
Japan and South Korea, the United States would ultimately be involved in
any escalated conflict and could play a decisive role in the region.
While Prof Ball believes it is too late for arms control mechanisms, he
says it is critical that Washington ensures policy development and
informed debate. He says there need to be counter measures and counter
counter measures developed for each level of escalation -- and fast.
"Given the high potential for things to go seriously wrong, we need to
do all we can to put in place processes to dampen and slow things down,"
said Prof Ball.

### Taiwan Prolif = Domino

#### Taiwan is [critical]{.underline} to [broader non-proliferation]{.underline}.

Accessed: 7-11-2019 //kent -- wh)

[Taiwan is **critical** to the global non-proliferation regime for a
number of reasons]{.underline}. First, [Taiwan is one of the world's
leading producers of **dual-use, high-tech materials** and
technologies.]{.underline} While these materials and technologies are
indispensable for many peaceful purposes, [some can also **benefit WMD
programs**.]{.underline} For example, [Taiwan is the world's leading
producer of **semi-conductor material**, which is used to produce
computers, telephones and radios, but can also be used for nuclear
weapons and missile programs]{.underline}. In one example from
2006-2007, the Royal Team Corporation, a Taiwanese trading company,
carried out 14 transactions to supply precision machinery workstation
computers to North Korea. The equipment, it turned out, was destined for
North Korea's missile and nuclear weapon programs.1

[Taiwan can also serve as a **transit point** for WMD-sensitive
transfers]{.underline}. For example, in a case that became public in
2006, Meisho Yoko, a Tokyo-based company, exported freeze-drying
equipment that could be used in bio-warfare applications to North Korea.
Meisho Yoko exported the equipment via a trading company in Taiwan.2 In
another case, the Japanese company, Tokyo Vacuum, exported vacuum pumps,
which are controlled items, to North Korea via a Taiwanese company
called Transmeritis.3

[These cases serve as a reminder that the non-proliferation challenge
facing the Taiwanese government is **not an abstract one**]{.underline}.
[Taiwan's geographic location makes it one of the world's **key transit
and trans-shipment hubs** for commodities, in general. As such, Taiwan
deals with high volumes of cargo at its ports, rendering it susceptible
to **malicious actors** that seek to smuggle WMD]{.underline}. [Taiwan's
commitment to **securing its ports** from being used for WMD transfers
is an **important component** of the world's fight against WMD
proliferation.]{.underline}

[Taiwan is also among the countries that have **advanced nuclear power
programs.**]{.underline} Universally, [nuclear power programs have
**inherent proliferation risks**.]{.underline} On the one hand,
[mastering certain elements of the nuclear fuel production process, such
as uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing, gives countries the
capability to **produce nuclear material** for a weapons
program]{.underline};4 on the other hand, peaceful nuclear energy
programs rely on material and technology that is by definition dual-use
in nature. Although [Taiwan]{.underline} currently does not enrich
uranium or reprocess spent fuel, it [does plan to further expand its
**nuclear energy program** and will therefore continue to rely on
**proliferation-sensitive materials** and technologies.]{.underline}

### 2NC Taiwan Independence Scenario

#### Abandoned Taiwan gets desperate and declares independence causes war with Taiwan and wrecks the alliance structure -- the link alone turns the case

**Aitken 13** (Aaron Aitken, Graduate of the Master of Arts program at
Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs,
"The Future of U.S.-Taiwan Arms Sales", 2/21/13,
[[https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/agora/index.php/ps_sandbox/article/view/19032/14712]{.underline}](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/agora/index.php/ps_sandbox/article/view/19032/14712),
RKK)

Abandoning Taiwan would, however, force the United States to overcome a
number of challenging domestic obstacles. The most significant obstacle
to halting arms sales is that it would require ending or modifying the
TRA. As the TRA is a piece of domestic legislation, this would require
the consent of Congress. There are two factors that make this unlikely.
First[, the domestic defense industry in the United States, which has a
powerful lobbying arm, has a vested interest in continuing arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}. In the 2006-2009 period, Taiwan ranked fourth among
global U.S. arms customers.29 As such, the defense lobby has and will
likely continue to have a significant impact on Taiwanese policy within
the United States. Perhaps most famously, both Clinton and Bush Sr.
supported the sale of F-16s to Taiwan in 1992 in hopes of winning votes
by protecting the defense industry. 30 Given the current tough economic
circumstances in the U.S., such a strategy will likely continue to have
considerable appeal for lawmakers, which defense lobbyists will be more
than happy to point out. Secondly, [Congress has had a longstanding
pro-Taiwanese stance]{.underline}. In 2011, a bipartisan group of over
forty-five senators actively supported selling Taiwan new F-16 C/D
fighter craft. 31 Given the overwhelming pro-Taiwanese disposition of
Congress, ending or modifying the TRA would require the expenditure of
considerable political capital on behalf of the administration, and
there seems to be no such inclination at this time. Just as designed,
the TRA essentially prevents the administration from unilaterally
abandoning Taiwan under pressure from China. More importantly[, even if
it were possible to overcome domestic opposition and end arms sales,
such a policy would be major strategic error, as it would compromise the
U.S.'s regional clout by emboldening the Chinese and **casting doubt on
U.S. strength in the eyes of its Asian allies**]{.underline}. As Nancy
Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue in the fall 2011 issue of The Washington
Quarterly, [such a move would "prove to an increasingly confident China
that Washington has become weak, vacillating, and
unreliable]{.underline}."32 Combined with strong nationalistic
sentiments within China, [such a perception would only encourage China
to continue taking an aggressive stance towards Taiwan. At the same
time, without U.S. support to bolster its confidence, Taiwan might put
recently improving ties with China on hold. In the worst-case scenario,
an abandoned and desperate Taiwan might even declare
independence]{.underline}.33 Under the boundaries delineated by China's
ASL, [this would almost certainly provoke an immediate military
response---creating a major conflict with the potential to shatter the
peace in East Asia]{.underline}. [Even if an abandoned Taiwan did
peacefully agree to reunification under increased Chinese pressure,
**such a move would call the United States' commitment to democracy and
liberal values into question, which would compromise its soft
power**]{.underline}. [America's support for Taiwan also serves as a
barometer by which other Asian nations can measure the United States'
commitment to resisting the hegemonic ambitions of the Chinese**. If
America suddenly abandoned Taiwan, Pacific nations with strong ties to
the United States, like Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the
Philippines, might be prompted reevaluate their alliances with the
United States**. This would undoubtedly harm some of the United States'
key interests in the region.]{.underline} As Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton notes, the United States' alliances with these nations "leverage
\[America's\] regional presence and enhance \[its\] regional leadership
at a time of evolving security challenges." 34 As such[, there is good
reason to think that the negative ramifications of abandoning Taiwan
outweigh any of the potential benefits of trying to win Beijing's
favor.]{.underline} If the U.S. should not abandon its commitments to
Taipei, should it move towards the opposite end of the spectrum and
actually increase arms sales to Taiwan? There is an ardent group of
analysts and policy makers who support this very stance. This group is
critical of both those in the U.S. who are reluctant to sell arms to
Taiwan as well as those in Taiwan who have been reluctant to approve
arms sales. This group is particularly concerned about maintaining the
military 'balance of power' across the Taiwan Strait. As Richard D.
Fisher notes, "force of arms remains a key tool for Beijing to achieve
its goal of unification under its terms."35 This claim is supported by
the Secretary of Defense's latest report to Congress, which found that
Chinese "defense planers continue to regard Taiwan as the Chinese
military's primary mission."36 This leads some analysts to argue that
the U.S. must do more to help Taiwan maintain the capacity to resist
China's force of arms, and they cite the U.S.'s obligations to Taiwan
under the TRA to justify this position. It certainly does seem as if
China will soon have the capability to take Taiwan by force. China's
rapid economic growth has been accompanied by a rapid expansion of its
military budget and capabilities. In the 2000-2010 period, China's
military spending grew at an average of 12.1 per cent per annum, and
total military spending reached \$160 billion in 2010. 37 This has
effectively allowed China to develop a credible capacity to threaten
Taiwan on short notice. China currently has 1000-1200 short ranged
ballistic missiles within range of Taiwan, about 400,000 troops deployed
in the two military regions across from Taiwan, and over 490 combat
aircraft within unrefueled range of Taiwan.38 Taiwan's military budget,
by contrast, peaked in 2000 at \$12.9 billion and is projected to
decrease to \$10.2 billion in 2011.39 Overall defense spending now sits
at only 2.1 per cent of Taiwanese GDP, despite a 2005 promise to
increase defense spending to 3 per cent of GDP.40 Partly as a result of
this significant gap in spending, the Office of the Secretary of Defense
argues that although it remains unlikely that the Chinese would
currently be able to execute a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, "the
balance of military force continues to shift in Beijing's favor."41 If
this trend continues unabated, it seems likely that China will acquire
the capacity to invade within the coming decades, unless of course,
Taiwan acquires additional defensive material. This projection forms the
basis on which critics argue for increased quantitative and qualitative
arms sales to Taiwan, so as to ensure that the PRC cannot invade or
seriously threaten it.

### 2NC Taiwan Conventional Scenario

#### Taiwan will develop ballistic missiles if the US stops selling them arms

**Swaine and Runyon 2,** (Michael D. Swaine, senior associate and
codirector of the China Program at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, Loren H. Runyon, senior intern at the National
Bureau of Asian Research, "Ballistic Missiles and Missile Defense in
Asia", 2002, <https://carnegieendowment.org/files/swainenbr.pdf>, RKK)

The Ching Feng is a single-stage, liquid-fueled BSRBM similar to the
U.S. Lance. Israel is believed to have aided Taiwan in building this
missile. However, even though the Ching Feng is believed to have become
operational in the early 1980s, it may have been terminated under U.S.
pressure. Its short range makes it inadequate as an offensive weapon
against the Chinese mainland if launched from Taiwan proper, although it
could reach the mainland if launched from Taiwan's offshore islands.66
[Some officials of the Taiwanese government have at times denied that
Taiwan possesses or is developing any missiles other than the
above-mentioned Ching Feng, although other officials and scholars have
suggested that at least some research and development is underway on
missiles with ranges up to 1,000 km]{.underline}. Reports from China
suggest that in 1995 Taiwan began developing a 950 km range solid-fueled
missile---the Tien Ma---based on the Tien Kung-2 SAM. Some sources even
suggest that these missiles are operational and have been deployed and
mixed in with silo-based Tien Kung-2 sites near Taipei and on the
offshore islands. However, no concrete evidence exists to confirm an
active Taiwanese SRBM or MRBM program.67 [Taiwan might develop an
inventory of mobile SRBMs during the next 10--15 years as part of its
ongoing effort to counter China's increasing military
capabilities]{.underline}. However, the likely size and configuration of
such a missile inventory is difficult to assess[. **Some observers
believe that Taiwan might focus greater efforts on acquiring MRBMs (or
even IRBMs) as part of a counter-strike deterrence capability against
China if the United States decides not to sell Taiwan upper-tier BMD
systems or to include Taiwan in a future East Asian BMD system**.68
However, the United States will almost certainly resist such deployments
as an excessively provocative move and a violation of MTCR
restrictions.]{.underline}

## A2: Taiwan Can't Prolif

### A2: Taiwan Won't Do It

#### Proliferation likely- Taiwan wants nuclear capability

It would have been one of the greatest crises of postwar Asia: the
revelation of a Taiwanese atomic bomb. [For Taiwan, the bomb would have
evened the odds against a numerically superior foe.]{.underline} For
China, a bomb would have been casus belli, justification for an attack
on the island country it considered a rogue province. Active from the
1960s to the 1980s, Taipei's efforts to develop nuclear weapons were
finally abandoned due to diplomatic pressure by its most important ally,
the United States. Taiwan's nuclear program goes back to 1964, when the
People's Republic of China tested its first nuclear device. The test was
not exactly a surprise to outside observers, but it was still Taiwan's
nightmare come true. Chinese and Taiwanese air and naval forces
occasionally skirmished, and it threatened to turn into all-out war.
Suddenly Taipei was confronted with the possibility that such a war
could turn nuclear. Even just one nuclear device detonated on an island
the size of Maryland would have devastating consequences for the
civilian population. [From Taiwan's perspective, a nuclear arsenal would
be the ultimate guarantor of national sovereignty. Even if the United
States split with the country]{.underline}, as it eventually did,
[Taiwanese nukes would keep the Chinese People's Liberation Army at
bay]{.underline}, a deterrent not only against Chinese nuclear power,
but against conventional forces as well. In hindsight, this would have
had a good chance of success, as North Korea's own procurement of
nuclear weapons has made the United States and South Korea reluctant to
retaliate over the country's various military provocations. The
Taiwanese bomb program began in 1967, using the Chung-Shan Institute of
Science and Technology's Institute for Nuclear Energy Research as a
cover. In 1969, Canada sold the country a heavy-water nuclear research
reactor as a prelude to what it hoped were commercial energy-producing
reactor sales---none too soon, as the Trudeau government recognized the
People's Republic of China in 1970. The reactor, known as the [Taiwan
Research
Reactor](https://books.google.com/books?id=OvwcjqXWzMIC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=taiwan+canada+nuclear+reactor&source=bl&ots=688oeRh-AG&sig=yFd646zkUlpcKMi4znoAb9vZsro&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8lpzaqrHSAhXJlFQKHaLXBzIQ6AEIUDAL#v=onepage&q=taiwan%20canada%20nuclear%20reactor&f=false),
went critical in 1973, and Taiwan set about creating a stockpile of
weapons-grade plutonium. Taiwan's nuclear program was under careful
surveillance by the United States, which recognized Taiwan as the
rightful Chinese government and protected the country from the mainland.
Still, [Washington was afraid a Taiwanese bomb would unnecessarily
enrage China]{.underline}, and by 1966 took steps to prevent the bomb
from happening. Washington ensured that Taiwanese reactors fell under
International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines, which would prevent
diversion of nuclear fuel for the purposes of building a weapon. But the
entire point of the program was to build a weapon, and it was inevitable
that Taiwan would be caught in the act. In 1975, the CIA
[reported](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/taiwan/nuke/), "Taipei conducts
its small nuclear program with a weapon option clearly in mind, and it
will be in a position to fabricate a nuclear device after five years or
so." At this point, the United States, Germany, France, Norway and
Israel had all supplied assistance. The program had procured heavy water
from America and uranium from South Africa. In 1976--77, the IAEA
inspected the activities at the military-run Institute for Nuclear
Energy Research. The IAEA discovered discrepancies in the Taiwanese
program, and in 1976, the United States protested the nuclear-weapons
program. In response, the island government promised to "[henceforth not
engage in any activities relating to
reprocessing](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb221/)." Despite the
promise, in 1977 the United States again detected suspicious activities
at INER. The U.S. State Department demanded changes to Taiwan's research
program that were more in line with peaceful research than nuclear
weapons, but stopped short of demanding Taiwan cease all nuclear
research and development. In 1978 the United States yet again detected a
covert program, this time a secret uranium-reprocessing program, and
forced Taiwan to stop. After being caught in the act many times,
Taiwan's nuclear-weapons program went into a period of dormancy. In the
mid-1980s, the program was started up again, and INER was detected
building a uranium-reprocessing facility that violated the commitments
Taiwan made in the 1970s. In December 1987, Col. Chang Hsien-yi, the
deputy director of INER and a longtime CIA asset, [defected to the
United
States](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/20/world/how-a-spy-left-taiwan-in-the-cold.html)
with proof of Taiwan's nuclear program. The previously top-secret
material was used to confront the Taiwanese government, which ended its
nuclear program once and for all in 1988. At the time of Colonel Chang's
defection, Taiwan is thought to have been just one or two years away
from a bomb. What kind of bomb was Taiwan attempting to develop? Two
possibilities are low-yield tactical nuclear weapons and a higher-yield
city killer. A tactical nuclear weapon would be useful to target the
mainland ports, airfields and headquarters driving a Chinese invasion of
Taiwan. While that wouldn't initially be of much help on the invasion
beachheads, it might bring the logistics supporting such an invasion to
a halt. This tactical nuke would probably have been delivered by the
Ching Feng, a.k.a. the "[Green
Bee](http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/taiwan/missiles.html)," a
short-range tactical missile that bore an uncanny resemblance to the
U.S.-made Lance missile. There are rumors the missile was actually of
Israeli origin, having been drawn from stocks supplied by the United
States, or developed based on Lance technology. Another, far worse
possibility is that [Taiwan could have developed a larger, city-killing
bomb. This could have been used to threaten Beijing directly, trading
the destruction of one government for another,]{.underline} and would
have been a more useful deterrent. Still, the 1,800-mile distance it
would take to deliver a nuke on Beijing was at the time as
insurmountable as the Taiwan Strait itself. Not even Israel had the
technology to assist in developing long-range missiles or aircraft to
deliver such a nuke. **[Taiwan's nuclear-weapons program, although
understandable, was ill considered]{.underline}. [A Taiwanese-Chinese
nuclear standoff would have destabilized the entire region---ironic,
considering Taiwan was seeking nuclear weapons to stabilize its defense
posture. There was really no military dilemma that Taiwanese nuclear
weapons would have decisively solved; any strike would have only been
made worse by the inevitable Chinese nuclear
counterattack.]{.underline}**

[But the entire point of the program was to build a weapon, and it was
inevitable that Taiwan would be caught in the act. In 1975, the CIA
reported, "Taipei conducts its small nuclear program with a weapon
option clearly in mind, and it will be in a position to fabricate a
nuclear device after five years or so]{.underline}." At this point, the
United States, Germany, France, Norway and Israel had all supplied
assistance. The program had procured heavy water from America and
uranium from South Africa.

#### Taiwan has the materials as well as the technological capacity to assemble a nuclear warhead

But as Michael Vincent reports, [Taiwanese defence analysts say the
country would have no problem building nuclear weapons if the government
deemed it necessary.]{.underline} MICHAEL VINCENT: [The Taiwan Straits
are one of the world\'s potential flashpoints.]{.underline} Beijing has
threatened pre-emptive strikes if Taiwan makes any new attempt to
develop nuclear weapons. [Taiwan tried in the 1980s]{.underline}, but
stopped under US pressure. Now however, claims about Taiwan\'s real
nuclear capabilities have been raised in Europe in the home of the
international nuclear weapons watchdog. [Unnamed diplomats linked to the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have been quoted overnight
as saying the agency has evidence Taiwan did experiment with separating
plutonium]{.underline} in the 1980s -- that, in essence, [Taiwan\'s
weapons program is more advanced than previously revealed]{.underline}.
Taiwan has been quick to deny the embarrassing report. Deputy Minister
of Atomic Energy Yang Chao-yie. YANG CHAO-YIE (translated): We did not
conduct any plutonium experiments around 1980, but before that [we did
have some plutonium research.]{.underline} MICHAEL VINCENT: What that
research was he would not say. Across the straits, the Foreign Ministry
Beijing said it was investigating the reports, but couldn\'t comment
until more is known. But Taiwan says it fully cooperates with IAEA and
allows its inspectors to go wherever they want, whenever they want. And
the Chairman of Taiwan\'s Mainland Affairs Council, Joseph Wu, has been
quick to stress his government\'s position on nuclear weapons. JOSEPH
WU: Let me make it very, very clear at this point that we do not have
that option and we don\'t want to develop that option. The nuclear
option has not been on the government agenda. MICHAEL VINCENT: Despite
those denials, some analysts believe [Taiwan could quickly develop
nuclear weapons if it was threatened.]{.underline} Andrew Yang is a
defence analyst at the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies in
Taipei. ANDREW YANG: [In terms of the technological know how, it is no
problem for Taiwan]{.underline}. But actually conducting or activating
this program would raise a lot of concerns in the international
community. Beijing has already indicated if Taiwan reactivated its own
nuclear weapon program that would be conducive to pre-emptive strikes if
necessary.

#### China is militarizing now

**Gertz '18** (Bill Gertz, senior editor of the Washington Free Beacon,
previously a national security reporter, editor, and columnist for 27
years at the Washington Times, "China Speeding Up Large-Scale Military
Buildup", The Washington Free Beacon,
<https://freebeacon.com/national-security/china-speeding-large-scale-military-buildup/>)q

Beijing is sharply speeding up a large-scale buildup of military forces
in preparation for a future conflict with the United States, according
to the congressional commission report made public Wednesday.

\"Today, the United States and its allies and partners are facing a
China more capable and increasingly confident in its ability to use the
military as a tool to intimidate countries throughout the Indo-Pacific
and support the expansion of its global interests,\" says the annual
report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.

Two decades of modernization of forces by the People\'s Liberation Army,
[the Communist Party of China-led army, \"has already resulted in a
force capable of contesting U.S. operations in the region, presenting
challenges to the U.S. military's]{.underline} longstanding assumption
of enjoying ground, air, maritime, and information dominance in a
conflict in the post-Cold War era.\"

The 539-page annual report by the bipartisan commission was made public
Wednesday and outlines a range of troubling Chinese activities and
policies in addition to the [military buildup, including large-scale
cyber theft of American technology, increased arms sales to rogue states
like Iran, and bullying of regional countries in Asia, including
Taiwan.]{.underline}

The report warns that Chinese supreme leader [Xi Jinping \"significantly
accelerated China's military modernization goals in late 2017, requiring
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to become a fully 'modern\' military
by 2035 and a 'world-class\' military by mid-century,\"]{.underline} the
report said.

The new guidance from Xi directs the PLA to achieve these goals nearly
15 years sooner than previous military modernization goals.

Prior to reaching its military buildup goals, China also may resort to
covert information and non-kinetic warfare to achieve its objectives.

The commission said the military buildup is part of [Chinese efforts to
take control over Asia and is increasing the danger of war.]{.underline}

\"Prior to the PLA achieving its objectives of becoming a 'modern\' and
'world-class\' military, Beijing may use coercive tactics below the
threshold of military conflict rather than resorting to a highly risky
use of military force to achieve its goals in the region,\" the report
said.

\"However, as [military modernization progresses and Beijing's
confidence in the PLA increases, the danger will grow that deterrence
will fail and China will use force in support of its claims to regional
hegemony.\"]{.underline}

The report warns that the buildup poses new dangers for the United
States and its allies in Asia that are seeking to maintain the
traditional democratic and free market order in the region against
Beijing\'s communist expansionism.

Caroline Bartholomew, a China commission co-chairman, said the rapid
buildup includes a streamlined command structure and improved Chinese
military ability to contest U.S. military operations.

The commission has asked the U.S. intelligence community to produce a
report on how China\'s Belt and Road Initiative will be used for
military purposes, she said.

[\"China is pouring resources in cyber and space warfare weapons,
artificial intelligence, long-range missiles, and other advanced weapons
systems,\"]{.underline} Bartholomew said during a press conference on
the release of the report.

\"It is already outpacing the United States in some of these areas,\"
she said.

\"Our report clearly documents China\'s increasing campaign to influence
countries around the world through both implied and real diplomatic,
economic, and military threats,\" Bartholomew said.

The report said the arms buildup already has weakened the decades-long
American military supremacy in the ground, air, maritime, and
information domains within the second island chain---referring to
China\'s strategy of projecting power further from its coasts through
two island chains stretching from northeast Asia through southeast and
as far east as Japan and Guam.

\"[By 2035, if not before, China will likely be able to contest U.S.
operations throughout the entire Indo-Pacific region]{.underline},\" the
report said. \"As China continues to achieve its military modernization
goals, the PLA will become increasingly capable of contesting all
domains of warfare throughout the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.\"

The Chinese strategy appears designed to contest the U.S. military by
developing high-technology weapons, such as maneuvering missiles capable
of targeting ships at sea, space weaponry, cyber warfare tools, and
other advanced arms.

The report said large-scale Chinese investment in such weapons threatens
a key U.S. military advantage.

\"China\'s rapid development and fielding of advanced weapons systems
would seriously erode historical U.S. advantages in networked, precision
strike warfare during a potential Indo-Pacific conflict,\" the report
said.

Another key development was China\'s recent creation of the Strategic
Support Force, a military service-level branch that combines
intelligence, information, cyber, space, and electronic warfare groups
in one place.

\"The new force signals Beijing's intent to build a military capable of
dominating these domains of warfare,\" the report said.

The rapid buildup of advanced naval forces also is a key feature of the
buildup, with deployment of large numbers of highly capable warships.

The warships provide \"naval expeditionary capabilities deployable
around the globe as early as 2025, well ahead of the PLA\'s broader 2035
modernization goals,\" the report said.

Also, China has rapidly fielded numerous types of medium- and long-range
missiles fired from aircraft, ships, submarines, and ground launchers.
The missiles \"substantially improve China\'s capability to strike both
fixed and moving targets out to the second island chain,\" the report
said.

[\"China'\' ability to threaten U.S. air bases, aircraft carriers, and
other surface ships presents serious strategic and operational
challenges for the United States and its allies and partners throughout
the Indo-Pacific,\" the report noted.]{.underline}

Another concern with the buildup is that China\'s military appears to be
preparing for a conflict as a way to deal with the so-called \"peace
disease\" and inability to conduct joint combat operations.

\"Much of Chinese leaders\' concerns center on the PLA\'s lack of recent
combat experience and the perceived inability of many operational
commanders to carry out basic command functions such as leading and
directing troops in combat,\" the report said.

Xi has promoted a \"strong military thought\" ideology since 2017 that
seeks to dispel the PLA\'s shortcomings in war preparedness and \"combat
mindset,\" the report said.

[The military buildup is driven by Xi\'s promotion of a so-called
\"China Dream\" that is based on China achieving global supremacy by
displacing the United States as the world\'s sole
superpower.]{.underline}

[Through an economic program called the Belt and Road Initiative, China
also is planning for future expeditionary warfare.]{.underline}

Retaking Taiwan and solidifying its hold over disputed maritime zones in
the South China Sea and East China Sea are key military objectives for
the Chinese.

The new commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Philip Davidson,
told Congress in April: \"China is pursuing a long-term strategy to
reduce U.S. access and influence in the \[Indo-Pacific\] region and
become the clear regional hegemon, and Beijing has already made
significant progress along this path. China is no longer a rising power
but an arrived great power and peer competitor to the United States in
the region.\"

Roy Kamphausen, a China commission member, said that China\'s doctrine
for using nuclear arms in a future conflict is unclear.

\"At the conventional level, the risk of escalation \[during a regional
conflict\] though remains undiminished and trending higher,\" Kamphausen
said.

China\'s handling of conflicts and their escalation differs from how the
United States handles conflicts,

\"So the risk remains high on the conventional side, even if the threat
of crossing the nuclear threshold remains low,\" Kamphausen said.

#### Current arms sale necessary to counter Chinese advances in the Taiwan Strait

**Ching 7/9**/19 (Nike Ching, State Department Correspondent of Voice of
America News Center, "US: Taiwan Arms Sale to Promote Peace, No Change
on \'One China\' Policy", Voice of America,
<https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-taiwan-arms-sale-promote-peace-no-change-one-china-policy>)q

STATE DEPARTMENT - The United States said Tuesday that its arms sale to
Taiwan is aimed at promoting "peace and stability" in the Asia Pacific
region and Washington is not changing its \"One China\" policy.

[China has demanded the U.S. to cancel the sale after the State
Department approved a request by Taiwan to purchase an estimated \$2.2
billion worth of military equipment.]{.underline}

The deal, announced Monday by the Defense Department\'s Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles and over 1,500 anti-tank missiles.
The agency said the package would not alter the basic military balance
in the region.

["Our interest in Taiwan, especially as it relates to these military
sales, is to promote peace and stability across the \[Taiwan\] Strait,
across the region,\"]{.underline} said State Department spokeswoman
Morgan Ortagus during a briefing.

[Ortagus added, \"There is no change, of course, in our long-standing
One China policy," which is based on three U.S.-China Joint Communiques
and the Taiwan Relations Act.]{.underline}

A State Department official told VOA the approved sale is consistent
with U.S. law and policy.

[\"This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security
interests by supporting the recipient\'s continuing efforts to modernize
its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,\" the
official said.]{.underline}

In Taipei, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen expressed appreciation for the
deal, saying the defensive weapons provided by the U.S. will boost
Taiwan\'s self-defense capabilities and deter potential military
threats.

In a tweet on Tuesday, Tsai said Taiwan will continue to invest in
national defense, defend democracy while promoting regional peace and
stability.

The potential deal has angered China, Taiwan\'s bitter cross-Strait
rival. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called on the U.S. Tuesday
to \"immediately cancel\" the deal, saying it \"seriously violates the
one-China principle \...grossly interferes in China\'s internal affairs
and undermines China\'s sovereignty and security interests.\"

Geng also said China has already filed formal complaints with the U.S.
through diplomatic channels.

The two sides split after the 1949 civil war when Chaing Kai-shek\'s
Nationalist forces were driven off the mainland by Mao Zedong\'s
Communists and sought refuge on Taiwan. [But Beijing considers the
self-ruled island part of its territory and has vowed to take control of
it, by force if necessary.]{.underline}

The U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979,
but U.S. presidents are bound by law to supply it with arms and come to
its defense.

The agreement also comes amid the Trump administration\'s ongoing trade
dispute with Beijing, with the two nations exchanging back-and-forth
tariffs on each other\'s goods since last year.

The U.S. announcement of the possible military sales to Taiwan was
welcomed by the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, an organization dedicated
to developing the trade and business relationship between the U.S. and
Taiwan.

[Council President Rupert Hammond-Chambers said, \"These tanks and
missiles will provide the Taiwan army with a modern capability to deter
and complicate the operational planning of the People\'s Liberation Army
(PLA) forces that coerce and threaten Taiwan.\"]{.underline}

Relations between Beijing and Taipei have been strained [since President
Tsai Ing-wen]{.underline}, the leader of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party[, took office in 2016 and refused to accept the
concept of China and Taiwan joined together as \"one
China.\"]{.underline}

[Beijing has since mounted an aggressive posture toward Taipei, such as
carrying out military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, blocking Taipei\'s
participation in international organizations, and persuading several
nations to switch diplomatic relations from Taiwan to
China.]{.underline}

#### Arms trade to Taiwan key to deter Chinese invasion

**Bowman and Smits 6/26**/19 (Bradley Bowman, senior director for the
Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, Mikhael Smits, research analyst, "Trade deal with China or
not, the US must bolster Taiwan's defense", Defense News,
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/26/trade-deal-with-china-or-not-the-us-must-bolster-taiwans-defense/)q

At the G-20 summit this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping may pressure
U.S. President Donald Trump to halt a planned U.S. arms deal with
Taiwan. Xi may even offer a tantalizing (but unreliable) concession on
the trade dispute in return for concessions on Taiwan. Accepting such an
offer would undermine U.S. national security and the democratic
principles Americans support.

Bullies tend to start fights they think they can win, an important
consideration when it comes to deterring Beijing from aggression against
Taiwan. [Unfortunately, due to China's massive military mobilization and
Washington's past reluctance to provide sufficient arms to Taiwan, the
military balance of power in the Taiwan Strait has shifted in Beijing's
direction --- making war there more likely. To begin reducing this risk,
Washington would be wise to follow through on delivery of the pending
arms package for Taiwan.]{.underline}

Based on the hope that economic liberalization would lead to political
liberalization, Washington facilitated Beijing's integration into the
global economy. American support for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization epitomized this strategy. Unfortunately, increased wealth
did not launch an inexorable march toward freedom in China. Instead, the
Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, used its financial windfall to fund a
major military expansion, bully its neighbors and attempt to push the
U.S. out of the region.

These dynamics have been perhaps most pronounced in the Taiwan Strait.

[Taiwan is prosperous and democratic, which creates an uncomfortable
contrast for the CCP and an object of emulation for its subjects on the
mainland.]{.underline} As in Hong Kong, the people of Taiwan have grown
accustomed to their freedoms and are reluctant to give them up.

Impatient --- and determined to exert control over the island ---
Beijing has employed political and military means to isolate and
intimidate Taiwan. First, Beijing has pressed countries to cut ties with
Taiwan. In 2018 alone, China successfully pressured three more countries
to sever Taiwanese relations, leaving only 17 that recognize the
island's government. [Taiwan's diplomatic isolation makes American
support all the more important.]{.underline}

More dangerously, due primarily to its extraordinary military buildup,
Beijing is moving ever closer to an ability to successfully invade the
island.

The U.S. Defense Department's Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released this
month notes that "China has never renounced the use of military force
against Taiwan, and continues to develop and deploy advanced military
capabilities needed for a potential military campaign."

[Indeed, as demonstrated by an increased number of military exercises
near Taiwan, the report warns that the People's Liberation Army is
"preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan with the mainland by
force."]{.underline}

In the past, Taiwan's superior technology and geography gave Taiwan a
military edge when it came to a potential conflict in the strait.
[However, as the Pentagon noted, due to China's military buildup, those
advantages are now largely gone.]{.underline}

In fact, as the Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019 report on Chinese
military power assessed, "Beijing's longstanding interest to eventually
compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by
Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for
China's military modernization."

Simultaneously, based on an overzealous and counterproductive desire in
previous administrations to avoid offending Beijing, Washington has
often been reluctant to provide Taiwan the arms it needed. Fearful to
not provoke the Chinese, the Obama administration rejected Taiwanese
requests for 66 new F-16 fighter jets --- instead only offering
modifications for its aging aircraft.

Admittedly, America's arms sales to Taiwan are relatively modest
compared to China's military buildup. [However, the failure to provide
Taiwan the required weapons exacerbated the shift toward Beijing in the
military balance.]{.underline} As a result, across most combat domains,
Beijing has established both a quantitative and qualitative advantage
over Taiwan.

Consequently, there is a risk that Beijing planners and decision-makers
might determine they could launch a successful offensive against Taiwan.
That perception in Beijing makes aggression in the strait and a war with
the United States more likely.

The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission listed aggression
against Taiwan as a top concern, arguing that allowing China to absorb
Taiwan by military force would constitute a "crushing blow to America's
credibility and regional position."

In addition to genuine hard-power concerns, there is also a matter of
principle. When an authoritarian power threatens and bullies a
democratic people, America is not neutral.

[Furthermore, providing Taiwan the means to defend itself is not just
consistent with sound policy and good principle --- it is the
law.]{.underline} [The Taiwan Relations Act made clear that the
establishment of diplomatic relations with Beijing rested on the
expectation that the future of Taiwan would be "determined by peaceful
means." To make this a reality, the law says the U.S. will provide the
weapons "necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability."]{.underline}

Admittedly, successive U.S. administrations have interpreted and
implemented this rather vague statute differently. [However, what seems
clear is that Taiwan's ability to defend itself against an increasingly
belligerent and capable military threat from the mainland is in
doubt.]{.underline} That would suggest that the current arms package
under consideration is not only permissible and advisable under the law,
but essential.

The administration deserves credit for expanding freedom of navigation
operations in the Taiwan Strait and, at least initially, asking Congress
to support new arms sales to Taiwan. Those are good first steps, but
they are not enough. In addition to providing these arms without delay
and stopping the erosion of U.S. military superiority vis-a-vis China,
Washington should also provide Taiwan the fighter aircraft and other
weapons it needs to make Beijing think twice before undertaking
aggression in the strait.

In its report this month, the Pentagon reiterated the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan's self-defense, invoking the words of the Taiwan Relations Act.

Those are good words. But in any potential conversation with President
Xi this week, President Trump would do well to remember that it will
take more than words to [deter aggression from the bullies in
Beijing.]{.underline}

#### Great power war -- US-China

**Wong '18** (Catherine Wong, reporter with the South China Morning Post
in Beijing, "China's rising challenge to US raises risk of South China
Sea conflict, Philippines warns", South China Morning Post, 2/19/18,
<https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2133864/chinas-rising-challenge-us-raises-risk-south-china-sea>)q

[The risk of "miscalculation" and armed conflict in the South China Sea
is rising as China starts to challenge US dominance in the disputed
waters]{.underline}, according to the Philippines' envoy to Beijing.

The assessment comes as Beijing appears to have expanded its
communications links and other facilities on artificial islands in the
area.

At a forum in Manila on Monday, ambassador Chito Sta. Romana said the
balance of power in the region was shifting as the two global powers
vied for control of the waters.

He added that the Philippines should not become entangled in the tense
maritime rivalry.

"Whereas before the [South China Sea was dominated by the US 7th Fleet,
now the Chinese navy is starting to challenge the
dominance]{.underline}," Sta. Romana said. "I think we will see a shift
in the balance of power."

But he also said the South China Sea had not become "a Chinese lake".

"Look at the US aircraft carrier, it's still going through the South
China Sea," he added, referring to the USS Carl Vinson, which has
patrolled the disputed waters and is on a visit to the Philippines.

He compared the two powers to elephants fighting and trampling on the
grass, saying: "What we don't want is for us to be the grass."

The Carl Vinson, with a fleet of about 40 fighter jets and roughly 5,000
American sailors, arrived in Manila this week in a display of American
presence in the Philippines.

The United States is also poised to send an aircraft carrier to Vietnam
in March, the first time in more than four decades.

But the presence of the warship would not change China's established
advantage in the region, according to Xu Liping, a researcher on
Asian-Pacific studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

["The aircraft carriers' visits are only symbolic -- to show that
America still has a military presence in the region and that it is still
a hegemon," Xu said.]{.underline}

["But with the military construction programme on the three major
islands in the South China Sea, China has built an effective network of
intelligence gathering and defence abilities."]{.underline}

In a US congressional hearing last week, Admiral Harry Harris, head of
the US Pacific Command, said [Beijing had unilaterally built seven new
military bases in the South China Sea]{.underline}, with new facilities
including "aircraft hangers, barracks facilities, radar facilities,
weapon emplacements \[and\] 10,000-foot runways".

US think tank CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative also said last
week that the northeastern corner of Fiery Cross Reef, known as Yongshu
Reef in China, had been equipped with a communications or sensor array
bigger than those found on other artificial islands in the Spratlys
chain. It said the facility could potentially serve as a signals
intelligence or communications hub for Chinese forces in the area.

Aaron Rabena, programme convenor at the Manila-based Asia-Pacific
Pathways to Progress Foundation, described [China's reclamation
activities in the South China Sea as a "real game-changer" that
challenged the US' prior dominance in the region]{.underline}.

["Strategic advantage and balance of power draws from both geography and
capability -- China now has both in the South China Sea," he
said.]{.underline}

And, as a defence treaty ally of the US and a smaller regional player,
Manila could be caught in the crossfire.

["An armed conflict in the South China Sea could mean a full-blown great
power war between Beijing and Washington,"]{.underline} Rabena said.
"The Philippines might get entangled and be drawn into a conflict."

### 2nc -- uq

#### SQ SCS is resisting the current Chinese militarization but is deteriorating

**Romaniuk and Burgers 3/20**/19 (Scott N. Romaniuk, Postdoctoral
Research Fellow in Security Studies at the China Institute, University
of Alberta, Tobias Burgers, doctoral candidate at the
Otto-Suhr-Institute (Free University of Berlin) where he researches the
rise and use of cyber and robotic systems in security relations, and the
future of military conflict, "China's Next Phase of Militarization in
the South China Sea", The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2019/03/chinas-next-phase-of-militarization-in-the-south-china-sea/)

China's astonishing expansion into the South China Sea's 1.35 million
square miles and its subsequent militarization of the region over the
past several years has cultivated a complex security environment. The
initial phase of that growing complexity was predicated on geopolitical
interest and expansion, notably during U.S. President Barack Obama's
second term in office.

Although it has been argued that regional tensions may remain stable
because China has ceased its land acquisition endeavors to the south,
the complex regional security environment may enter into a new phase of
heightened tension and complexity during 2019. [This [next phase could
emerge as a result of China's dedicated push to consolidate its gains in
the]{.mark} South China Sea [(SCS) through the use of military]{.mark}
and political [powers]{.mark} in tandem with sharp threats as a result
of military patrols and a quantum leap in the deployment of surveillance
aircraft, guided-missile destroyers, and a bank of military
equipment.]{.underline}

Despite a momentary lull in adding to its treasure trove of SCS
features, China's behavior in the SCS exemplifies the aim of achieving
regional dominance. However, Beijing has yet to achieve the level of
control it seeks over the strategically vital waterway. In a region
where five other parties -- Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Taiwan -- have made territorial claims, China's position
remains under pressure and its territorial assets under continued
threat.

Indeed, Beijing's outcry over what it sees as provocative U.S.
incursions, which China has treated as naked military aggression, serves
as a strong indication that China's assets in the SCS and the country's
interests in the region remain vulnerable. So long as external threats
persist, acquisition and buildup can be expected to move forward.

With China's initial island-building campaign nearly 10 years old, the
next phase of China's SCS expansion is the consolidation and military
fortification of its territorial assets -- garrisoning the many tiny
islets once deemed uninhabitable, including the strategic Scarborough
Shoal (Huangyan Dao), lying just 140 miles west of the large Philippine
island of Luzon and currently under development. The establishment of
military bases has culminated in the creation of China's "strategic
triangle." [Even with the construction of aircraft bases, detection
systems, and weapon delivery systems, the impact of China's methodical
efforts in the SCS have failed to yield considerable change in the
status quo of power relations.]{.underline}

Over the past several years, China has expanded existing reefs and
atolls by thousands of acres, but its military presence and preparedness
still fall short of a level adequate for claiming control over the
entire SCS. The process is likely to be a much longer one than expected.
Islet acquisition and development has not mitigated existing territorial
claims by other states sharing the sea, nor are those claims --
supported by distant partners and allies -- likely to disappear in the
near or distant future.

A combination of three factors exponentially raises the potential for
further militarization in the SCS: China's past expansion and continuing
consolidation, which clash with persistent claims by states situated
adjacent to the SCS; Washington's declaration that the freedom of
navigation (FON) principle of customary international law should be
preserved; and Beijing's departure from past promises not to further
develop its SCS assets.

Civilian and rescue operations have been the main justification for the
ongoing construction of military installations and the placement of
weapons and weapon systems, including sophisticated combat aircraft,
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), anti-ship (ballistic) missiles, and
jamming technology, in spite of President Xi Jinping's guarantee that
China's territorial assets would not be militarized. Beijing has
indicated that future United Nation's (UN) peacekeeping missions
involving the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would necessitate
additional bases. These steps are key to strengthening China's
anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capacity.

[In light of China's inability to match all aspects of U.S. military
capability -- at least in qualitative terms, though
numerically-speaking, China possesses extraordinary military strength --
in the short term, a military presence beyond China's immediate borders
is a logical and necessary rung if China hopes to project its power to a
level that goes beyond parity in the SCS. China's military investment
continues to increase and the country, while facing a cluster of
opposition off its eastern shores, has only a single front on which to
focus]{.underline}. Such incidents as the arrest of Huawei's chief
financial officers, Meng Wanzhou and China's persistent trade dispute
with the United States have generated considerable attention, providing
useful foliage for Chinese activities in the SCS. As a result, China's
interests in the SCS have become relatively peripheral in the media.

[Distracting issues also give China valuable time to establish a
stronger military presence on its existing holdings in the SCS rather
than seeking to expand and pursue additional reclamation projects. China
has turned to other methods for rolling out its claim to the
south]{.underline} in the recent past, with Brunei deepening its
economic reliance on China via financial and trading arrangements. At
the wave of a political wand, China not only secured a piece of its own
interests, but those of Brunei as well, while acquiring a much-needed
ally in the SCS region that can either remain silent or sway in a
direction that suits Beijing's strategic interests.

The Philippines has cozied up to China after being successfully seduced
by the promise of China's Belt and Road. The grandiose development
strategy is as much a political instrument as it is an economic
initiative and one with which Beijing can increase its political
influence over the policy trajectories of SCS states in the context of
SCS claims and territory.

[Vietnam, however, remains comparably defiant and stalwart in its
approach to the SCS, with a record of challenging China and systematic
efforts to turn the SCS into a "lake" of its own. Vietnam's efforts to
proscribe Chinese ventures in the SCS, notably the creation of further
artificial islands, an influx of warships, and the potential
establishment of an air defense identification zone (ADIZ), demonstrate
the limits of Beijing's friendly pressure on others to quietly remove
their flags from disputed areas.]{.underline}

China has demonstrated that other avenues exist for inching its way
forward in the SCS and expanding its de facto control. Dragging out
formal talks and buying off its neighbors are just two possible tactics.
Four years after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, Moscow has and
continues to employ similar tactics to tighten its hold on and
increasingly fortify the Black Sea peninsula. [Similarly, the idea that
China will maintain its presence on numerous features in the SCS and
increase its military presence in a show of control cannot easily be
gainsaid, particularly as the culmination of China's efforts to date
have significantly augmented China's military presence in the SCS and
drastically upgraded Beijing's peacetime and wartime
position.]{.underline}

#### US-China tensions raising in SCS now -- airforce, navy, nuclear missile competition 

**Roblin 5/22**/19 (Sébastien Roblin, Master's Degree in Conflict
Resolution from Georgetown University and served as a university

International waters are generally defined as being twelve nautical
miles from a country\' shoreline. But, Beijing claims vast swathes of
the South China Sea as its exclusive preserve, even if those waters are
hundreds of miles distant from mainland China and directly adjected to
other Asian countries[. In recent years, Beijing has taken to creating
artificial islands and deploying military bases on them to reinforce its
claims, as well as harassing ships and aircraft passing through the
South China Sea.]{.underline} It utilizes a vast naval militia of sorts,
including hundreds of nominally civilian boats and vessels, to advance
Chinese foreign policy and control.

Two superpowers eye each other uneasily across the Pacific---one well
established after decades of Cold War conflict, the other a rising power
eager to reclaim regional hegemony. Fortunately, despite profoundly
different political systems, China and the United States are not as
intrinsically hostile to each other as were the West and the Soviet
Union---in fact, they have a high degree of economic interdependence.

Still, history shows that there is often a risk of war when a rising
power challenges the ascendancy of an existing one. Beijing and
Washington have profound---though fortunately not
comprehensive---disagreements on matters of global governance. They also
have reasons to mistrust each other. Fortunately, there are historical
examples of rival superpowers coexisting mostly peacefully for long
periods of time. For example, see the century in between the defeat of
Napoleon and World War I, during which there was no European-wide war.

(This first appeared late last year.)

Still, the balance of power between nations will likely play a role
alongside diplomacy---a fleet that is never used in war may still
prevent one, for example, by deterring possible opponents.

[China today has the largest military on the planet, with two million
active personnel in the People's Liberation Army (PLA). However, China
only spends slightly over one-third as much as the United States,
accounting for thirteen percent of annual global military spending in
2017, compared to thirty-five percent by the United States according to
SIPRI.]{.underline}

Yet, the Chinese government is aware that the large size of its forces
in part reflects an antiquated mid-twentieth century force structure
emphasizing massive, low-quality ground armies. Starting in 2015,
Chinese President Xi Jinping---who seems set to remain in power
indefinitely---announced a major reform initiative to radically downsize
PLA ground forces to improve their quality.

[PLA ground and air forces still exhibit a wide range of quality,
fielding both early Cold War systems and cutting-edge
variants.]{.underline} For example, the PLA musters 8,000 tanks---but
3,000 are 1950s-era Type 59 and Type 63 tanks. At the same time, the PLA
also fields 500 Type 99 tanks which are in a similar ballpark to the
very capable U.S. M1 Abrams. The PLA Air Force also has a similar issue.
For instance, of its 1,700 aircraft, roughly a third are dated J-7
fighters, while another fourth include modern fourth-generation J-10s
and J-11s comparable to U.S. F-15s and F-16s and even a few
fifth-generation stealth fighters.

[By contrast, the U.S. military operates over two-thousand
fourth-generation combat jets, increasingly being supplemented by
fifth-generation stealth designs. These newer U.S. planes theoretically
enjoy a massive edge in long-range aerial combat and in penetrating
enemy airspace.]{.underline}

[America\'s massive military spending reflects its technology-oriented
approach to warfare, a paradigm which seeks to send a drone or guided
missile in place of a man (or woman) whenever
possible]{.underline}---especially as every friendly casualty may result
in a political firestorm[. Therefore, the Pentagon prefers to develop
comprehensive intelligence and communication capabilities to direct a
few weapons systems with a high degree of precision.]{.underline} This
in contrast to fielding a larger, and cheaper, number of platforms which
was typical in the past such as World War II. This paradigm favors
'networked warfare\', in which various weapons systems exchange sensor
data. A ship, for example, may detect an attacking jet and pass the
targeting data to a nearby fighter which can then use the telemetry to
launch a missile without exposing itself by turning on its radar---or
vice versa.

[China is also an enthusiastic adopter of this doctrine and has arguably
made greater strides in developing armed drones and advancing networking
capabilities than Russia or various European countries. On the one hand,
Chinese industry still lags notably behind in the development of
technologies such as jet engines and suffers quality control issues.
However, on the other, it is relatively strong in the realm of
electronics and is happy to copy both Western and Russian technologies.
Furthermore, Chinese hackers have also proven reasonably adept at
hacking into foreign computer systems and perpetrating industrial
espionage]{.underline}, but Beijing has at least so far refrained from
election-manipulation tactics practiced by its neighbor Russia.

Posture for Intervention Abroad and Defense At Home

Operationally, the PLA and U.S. military have very different needs. The
U.S. is geographically isolated from its foes and instead depends on a
massive network of overseas bases on six continents to engage or contain
adversaries. This requires globe-spanning logistical capabilities
including hundreds of transport planes, aerial refueling tankers to keep
jet fighters and transports aloft, and amphibious transports and
carriers to convey Marine units. Just as importantly, strong diplomatic
alliances are necessary to maintain those overseas bases and keep them
supplied with fuel, personnel and munitions. [For example, U.S.
operations in Asia are heavily dependent on alliances with South Korea,
Japan, Singapore, the Philippines and more recently, India. Several of
these Asian countries, as well as western and central Europe, also rely
upon U.S. military forces to meet their security needs.]{.underline}

China is only beginning to acquire such logistics and is situated in a
very crowded neighborhood surrounded by potential military competitors
such as India, Russia and Japan. (Personally, this author does not
believe contemporary Japan will become an aggressive military power
anytime soon, but the Chinese don\'t see it that way due to their bitter
memories of Japanese invasion.) Additionally, Beijing has only a few
military alliances with Pakistan, North Korea, and a few southeast Asian
nations. [But, China is slowly developing multi-national institutions
such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and its aspirational Silk
Road project in hopes of fostering stronger ties.]{.underline}

However, China still retains tense relations with India, a country with
a comparably huge population but only one-quarter of the gross domestic
product, from which China seized Himalayan territory in a brief 1962
war. Moreover, Beijing has built up its forces and road network on its
border with India, and also constructed a series of bases in nearby
countries to 'envelop\' India.

China is also expanding its capacities for longer-range expeditionary
operations befitting its status a superpower---particularly in Africa,
where Chinese companies maintain a dominant and ever-growing presence.
Beijing\'s non-interference and no-questions-asked approach to human
rights and corruption issues have won it many friendly governments on
the African continent.

For example, Chinese troops have deployed as peacekeepers in Mali, where
they have seen some action, and recently opened a naval base in
Djibouti---just seven miles across from a long-established American base
there. The PLA and Peoples' Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) have also
concentrated on training a Special Forces and Marine branch suitable for
more expeditionary operations.

Despite all of this, the United States military still has vastly more
recent combat experience, particularly in joint operations coordinating
multiple services. The PLA's last major armed conflict was a not very
successful punitive invasion of Vietnam in 1979. Today, the PLA is only
beginning to implement a more joint-operations oriented doctrine while
struggling to overcome the traditional parochialism of the military
hierarchy, which occupies a prestigious place in its society.

Nuclear Doctrine

The United States maintains more than twenty times the number of nuclear
warheads that China does (1,350 compared to 45 deployed and 4,000
compared to 270 when including stockpiles, according to the Arms Control
Association). This reflects Washington\'s more aggressive nuclear
posture, which holds that the U.S. has the right to launch a nuclear
first strike in a conflict, even if it has only been attacked with
conventional weapons. (Moscow has a similar stance, claiming it may use
tactical nuclear weapons to 'de-escalate\' a conventional war.) [China,
by contrast, has a defensive nuclear doctrine claiming it will only
employ nukes if attacked with them first.]{.underline}

[While some might scoff at the distinction---after all, doctrine does
not prevent a country from launching a first strike if it wants to---the
reality is that offensive and defensive nuclear warfare involve
different force structures.]{.underline} The United States has a massive
arsenal in a nuclear 'triad\'. This is made up of ballistic missile
submarines (which are basically so hard to hunt there is no way to stop
them all); nuclear bombers (useful for signaling to an opponent the
possibility of a nuclear attack, or for hitting mobile targets); and
ground-based missile silos (the least flexible of the three, but these
allow more targets to be hit and force an enemy to devote resources to
attack them). Such an arsenal is capable of launching a broader assault
designed to disable an opponent\'s military capability to retaliate and
therefore more easily includes the option of a first strike.

[In contrast, China holds a no-first-use doctrine because it maintains
only nuclear ballistic missiles and a few ballistic missile
submarines---though it may one day re-introduce a nuclear bomber
component. China\'s smaller arsenal is also inadequate to deliver a
knock-out first strike but is instead a deterrence-oriented
'counter-value\' force threatening nuclear annihilation of an
adversary\'s largest cities were China to come under attack. Beijing has
become nervous, in recent years, by the expansion of U.S. ballistic
missile defense capabilities, which may eventually prompt a move to
enlarge the arsenal.]{.underline}

Staring Contest over the Pacific

It is at sea that the United States and China are most openly in
competition. Today, U.S. warships regularly operate off of Chinese
littoral water, but not vice versa. As maritime invasions dealt China
crippling and humiliating blows in the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, Beijing places great importance on pushing the U.S. Navy away
from its belt of bases it calls the 'first island chain\', and
preferably even further to the second or third (which includes Hawaii).

International waters are generally defined as being twelve nautical
miles from a country\' shoreline. But, Beijing claims vast swathes of
the South China Sea as its exclusive preserve, even if those waters are
hundreds of miles distant from mainland China and directly adjected to
other Asian countries. In recent years, Beijing has taken to creating
artificial islands and deploying military bases on them to reinforce its
claims, as well as harassing ships and aircraft passing through the
South China Sea. It utilizes a vast naval militia of sorts, including
hundreds of nominally civilian boats and vessels, to advance Chinese
foreign policy and control.

For its part, the U.S. Navy has continued to dispatch destroyers and
cruisers on 'Freedom of Navigation' patrols to maintain a presence in
these international waters. More importantly, it has a network of bases
in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Singapore, as well as on
islands such as Guam and Hawaii, which would be hard to dislodge it
from---unless alliances with those countries are allowed to fray.

[However, China has built up a sufficient arsenal of ground-based
ballistic missiles, warplanes, and naval assets that arguably it has won
military superiority in its littoral waters---something which was not
the case a few decades ago. Also, the conventional missile force could
pose a significant threat both to crucial U.S. airbases and even
carriers at hundreds of miles away at sea.]{.underline}

[On the other hand, China is only beginning to catch up with United
States\'s unique fleet of eleven nuclear-powered
supercarriers]{.underline}, each of which carries dozens of Super Hornet
and Growler fighters and, eventually, F-35B stealth jets. Each carrier
is furthermore protected by a task force of escorting warships boasting
networked radars, submarine-detecting sonars, and missile defenses.

Currently, China has two lower-capability ski-jump style carriers in
service carrying smaller wings of J-15 fighters. But China plans on
building two larger carriers with superior catapult-assisted takeoff,
and eventually two nuclear supercarriers with newer electromagnetic
catapults. It also is building up a fleet of both small and large
surface combatants armed with very long-range anti-ship
missiles---though the doctrine and sensors to pull off such long-range
attacks may still be in development.

The U.S. and Chinese Navies also have very different submarine fleets.
The U.S. Navy has to operate across vast distances and has built up a
force of forty to fifty attack submarines, and eighteen Ohio-class
ballistic and cruise-missile subs, that can remain underwater nigh
indefinitely due to nuclear propulsion. China has in service only
slightly over a dozen nuclear-powered submarines, but seventy much
cheaper diesel, or quieter AIP-powered submarines, which are suitable
for short-range operations off of China's coast. Though noisier than U.S
or Russian submarines, the numerous Chinese diesel and AIP submarines
could still be quite effective in an anti-ship role.

China and the United States will likely remain fixated on each other as
potential military competitors for decades to come---but if relations
are prudently managed, they won't have to become actual adversaries in a
war. The two countries' respective capabilities, however, will play a
role in how their global influence is perceived.

#### Taiwan arms are key to Chinese deterrence

**Rigger '11** (Shelley Rigger, Brown Professor and chair of political
science at Davidson college, "Why giving up Taiwan will not help us with
China", American Enterprise Institute", 11/29/11,
http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/)

Taiwan Still Matters to US Interests

While Gilley may be right in the long run---Taiwan's people and leaders
may decide someday that US defense assistance has become an obstacle to
their preferred path of rapprochement with the PRC---for now, the
conventional strategic and normative arguments for keeping the defense
relationship in place remain compelling.

The most-cited strategic argument for continuing US security assistance
to Taiwan is that the existing security architecture in the Asia-Pacific
region and beyond serves the interests of many nations. Within the
network of global security relationships, Washington's behavior toward
Taiwan indicates its attitude toward security assistance generally,
including its alliance commitments and willingness to honor other
obligations around the world. As retired admiral Eric McVadon said,
"American credibility as an alliance partner and as a bulwark of peace
and stability in the region and around the world would be sorely
diminished were we to abandon the \[Taiwan Relations Act\], cease
support of Taipei, and lead Beijing to conclude that it can attack
Taiwan and not be repulsed."\[6\]

The system of alliances the United States constructed in Northeast Asia
after World War II and the Korean War is not to be discarded on a whim.
From 1895 to 1945 Japan, Russia, and China battled for regional
supremacy, devastating huge swaths of Korea and China. American security
guarantees put in place in the mid-twentieth century suspended those
conflicts. Ample evidence exists in current affairs---including
conflicts over contested islands in the East and South China Seas---to
suggest that military rivalry could return to East Asia. The US
presence, however it may offend China, actually lightens Beijing's
military burden by restraining neighboring countries' military
investments and easing their strategic anxiety. As Glaser acknowledges,
"the U.S. alliance with Japan also benefits China by enabling Japan to
spend far less on defense. Although the United States' power far exceeds
Japan's, China has seen the alliance as adding to regional stability,
because it fears Japan more than the United States."\[7\]

Taming the military rivalries that once ravaged Northeast Asia freed
countries in the region to pursue domestic development and provided a
foundation for explosive economic growth and a liberal economic order
based on free markets and open trade. Military alliances stabilized the
international system while new economic and political organizations from
the United Nations to the World Trade Organization nurtured nations'
shared interests. This system, in which the United States has served as
chief enforcer and guarantor, secured six decades of peace, stability,
and prosperity in non-Communist Northeast Asia.

This US-led order is far from perfect. Developing countries suffered
terribly from proxy wars and economic isolation during the Cold War, and
since then new threats---from climate change to transnational
terrorism---have appeared. Although the bipolar competition between two
superpowers has disappeared, the need for global cooperation to address
economic and military challenges has not. Nations continue to look to
the United States to provide leadership in mobilizing that cooperation
and addressing those threats, and how the United States manages its
relationships with longtime friends, including Taiwan, is an important
measure of its commitment to that leadership role.

Glaser dismisses the idea that security assistance to Taiwan helps
sustain the postwar security architecture in East Asia. He writes, "the
risks of reduced U.S. credibility for protecting allies . . . should be
small, especially if any change in policy on Taiwan is accompanied by
countervailing measures."\[8\] Certainly, other nations differentiate
between Taiwan---which not only is not a formal US ally, but which the
US government does not even recognize as a state---and other US defense
partners. Nonetheless, no competent security planner would dismiss a US
retreat from a long-standing security commitment as irrelevant,
especially if it appears driven by American weakness.

If Washington appears to be backing away from its commitment to the
alliances and institutions in which it has invested so much, other
governments will take that as a sign that they may not be able to rely
on US-backed security arrangements to ensure their future security,
forcing them to become more competitive and individualistic. According
to retired Army colonel and military analyst Albert Willner, America's
friends already are on the alert for signs of a decline in US
commitments. He said in an interview, "There is a growing sense in the
world that the US is a fair-weather friend, it won't be there for the
long run. This causes people in many countries to maneuver ahead of
time, to get into position in anticipation of the day the US pulls back.
If the US makes decisions regarding Taiwan that reinforce this
perception, it will have profound implications for our other
relationships."

Another strategic interest the United States has in maintaining close
ties to Taiwan rests with Taiwan's position on the front line of China's
rise. China's behavior toward Taiwan indicates how it will perform its
role as a lead actor on the world stage. As Randall Schriver, a former
deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
put it, "Beijing's ambitions go beyond Taiwan, but right now, it's the
Taiwan issue that drives their military modernization, so it's very
important to us. Taiwan is a prism through which we can understand
China's evolution, and gain insights into it." Richard Bush, a leading
analyst of the US-PRC-Taiwan relationship, summarized these concerns
when he said, "How the Taiwan Strait issue is resolved is an important
test---perhaps the most important test---of what kind of great power
China will be and of how the US will play its role as the guardian of
the international system." By extension, how the United States and its
allies treat Taiwan is an important indicator of what other countries in
the region can expect from Washington as the PRC's influence expands.
They may ask, if the United States acquiesces to a rising China on the
Taiwan issue, will it also acquiesce on issues important to them?

Beyond these strategic arguments, moral reasons exist for why the United
States should not be hasty in ending its security assistance to Taiwan.
One is that Washington and Taipei share decades of friendship,
cooperation, common purpose, and shared sacrifice. US officials tend to
trust democratic Taiwan more than the authoritarian PRC.

The United States made itself responsible for Taiwan when it required
Taipei to restrain its own ambitions in exchange for American support.
And as McVadon observed, affinity with Taiwan comes naturally to
Americans of a certain age: "Americans of my generation feel close to
Taiwan, have affection for its people, and cannot bring themselves to
succumb to the reasoning that we would be better off by abandoning
support for Taiwan. Taiwan is like a blood brother; it need not do any
more to warrant loyalty. The PRC is, in contrast, a stranger. Its
qualities run hot and cold. Its origin and upbringing create
uncertainties; trust has to be developed. And these feelings, in both
cases, are reciprocal. . . . It is easy to feel close to Taiwan."

Fidelity to American values also matters to Taiwan policy because US
treatment of Taiwan stands as a critical test of America's commitment to
its core foreign policy values: democracy, freedom, and market
economics. Taiwan's democratic transition signals success for America's
efforts to encourage democratization around the world without outside
intervention or bloodshed. "Taiwan has grown into a society that
represents most of our important values that we try to promote elsewhere
in the world," says an American diplomat with experience in Taiwan and
China. "Look at all we've done to promote these values in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Taiwan achieved everything we want, all on its own." "It
sounds syrupy," says another former US official, "but Taiwan can offer
hope to other countries. The fact that it can stay vibrant in spite of
all its limitations is inspiring."

If societies aspiring to install or consolidate democratic political
systems look to Taiwan for inspiration, they look to the United States
and its allies for signs that they will support young democracies. Nancy
Bernkopf Tucker, the leading historian of US-Taiwan relations, pointed
out that "the US bears some responsibility for Taiwan's democracy, not
least because it made those changes with encouragement and pressure from
us." The diplomat quoted above concurs: "If we are seen as reducing our
commitment to Taiwan, it will have an impact on our position around the
world. It would seem we don't believe in our own values. Taiwan is a
means to an end for the US, at least in the sense that it helps us
maintain our values and credibility around the world. Our presidents
describe Taiwan as a beacon of democracy in their congratulatory
statements, but when we get down to business, that conviction is not
carried out with the gusto it deserves."

Critics of Glaser's Foreign Affairs article stressed this argument,
prompting him to reply: "Although my article focused on U.S. national
security interests, it is true that the United States has a significant
interest in supporting freedom and democracy around the world, including
in Taiwan. These interests offer the strongest argument for Washington
to maintain its current commitment to Taipei. But the United States
should pursue these other interests \[support for freedom and
democracy\] only if they do not pose a serious national security
risk."\[9\] Perhaps Glaser is right that the United States cannot afford
to sacrifice other interests to protect Taiwan's democracy. But would a
retreat from the security relationship really serve the interests Glaser
sees as more important?

No Silver Bullet for US-China Woes

Even if it were true that Sino-American tensions could be melted away
with a single policy change in Washington, the United States should
still continue to support Taiwan to maintain the credibility of its
alliances and uphold its commitment to democracy as a desirable and
feasible goal for developing nations. But, in reality, ending US defense
assistance to Taipei is unlikely to produce the salutary effects the
critics of current US policy anticipate. Such a change would indeed
delight Beijing; however, it would create new problems just as
intractable as the old ones but less familiar and potentially even more
challenging.

The point of departure for critics of America's existing Taiwan policy
is their shared belief that ending security assistance to Taiwan would
improve US-China relations. As Freeman puts it, "The kind of long-term
relationship of friendship and cooperation China and America want with
each other is incompatible with our emotionally fraught differences over
the Taiwan issue. These differences propel mutual hostility and the sort
of ruinous military rivalry between the two countries that has already
begun. We are coming to a point at which we can no longer finesse our
differences over Taiwan. We must either resolve them or live with the
increasingly adverse consequences of our failure to do so."\[10\]

As a syllogism, this argument makes sense: Beijing believes Taiwan
should be unified with the mainland, and it views US security assistance
to Taiwan as the primary reason it is not. Because unification is a core
issue for the PRC, leaders in Beijing cannot ignore or overlook US
intervention; they must constantly challenge it. Thus, if the United
States ended its security assistance to Taiwan, the biggest irritant in
US-China relations would disappear.

In practice, unfortunately, there is no guarantee that a change in US
policy toward Taiwan would instantly or automatically end, or even
significantly reduce, the tensions the Taiwan issue creates in
Sino-American relations. Ending security assistance to Taiwan would
raise expectations in China without removing the existing obstacles to
peaceful unification. It likely would provoke panic in Taiwan, but it
would not make the Taiwanese people any more enthusiastic about
unification. On the contrary, the more vulnerable and threatened the
Taiwanese people felt, the harder it would be for them to consider
China's overtures rationally.

For decades, the United States has justified arms sales to Taiwan on the
grounds that Taipei can negotiate with Beijing more effectively from a
position of strength than of weakness. It is easy to dismiss this logic
as a rationalization, but as Randall Schriver said, "In what other
instance involving a negotiation is the weaker party better off? . . .
Historically, what you find is where there is equal power---or, at
least, credible deterrent power---you get better outcomes." Neither
Beijing nor Taipei is well served by a negotiating process that leads to
a bad deal, including one Taiwanese citizens cannot accept. Successfully
pressuring Taiwan's negotiators into accepting a deal might seem like a
victory for Beijing, but if Taiwan's domestic politics make it
impossible to implement the deal, the long-term result might be worse
than no deal at all.

Ending US defense assistance to Taiwan---whether by repealing the Taiwan
Relations Act or by simply declining to provide defensive equipment to
Taiwan's armed forces---would not "ripen" Taiwan for peaceful
unification or obviate the rationale the United States has historically
followed regarding Taiwan. It would, however, intensify the debate over
Taiwan policy within the United States. Taiwan still has many US friends
and supporters, and many foreign policy experts would question a
decision to change course. The policy changes Gilley, Glaser, Freeman,
and Owens recommend would stimulate a debate over China policy at a time
when negative attitudes toward the PRC already are on the rise. The last
thing Sino-American relations need is an acrimonious, politically
charged debate in Washington over policy toward China and Taiwan. In
sum, changing America's Taiwan policy could easily induce a poisonous
turn in the domestic politics of US China policy without making peaceful
unification easier.

A change in US Taiwan policy would challenge China in yet another way.
Although Chinese leaders no doubt are genuinely furious about what they
see as US interference in China's domestic affairs, US security
assistance to Taiwan actually reinforces their current policy direction.
In recent years, Beijing has insisted domestic economic and social
development must come first; risky and expensive undertakings, however
attractive, cannot be allowed to undermine that goal. As long as Taiwan
does not lunge for formal independence, unification can wait.

US security assistance---both the possibility of direct intervention and
support for Taiwan's self-defense---makes unification risky and
expensive. If the United States withdraws its support, we should expect
nationalists and hardliners in the PRC to press the Chinese Communist
Party leadership to solve the Taiwan problem sooner rather than later.
China's newly muscular posture in the East and South China Seas is
already raising eyebrows around the region; the last thing Beijing needs
is a reinvigorated nationalist movement howling for satisfaction on
another offshore issue. Although we can hardly expect them to admit it,
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait serves the political interests of
Chinese leaders whose top priority is domestic development and regime
stability.

Indeed, even the best-case scenario for Beijing is unpredictable and
potentially destabilizing. We can say Gilley is right, and Taiwan is
moving toward Finlandization. In fact, there is ample evidence for a
consensus within Taiwan that deeper engagement with mainland China is
both inevitable and desirable. At the same time, however, the Taiwanese
people are more attached than ever to their political autonomy and
distinctive identity. Withdrawing US security assistance would not
change these attitudes, but many Taiwanese people would view this
action, rightly or wrongly, as a deathblow to the island's autonomy.
Some would try to flee. Others would urge their government to develop
doomsday weapons to keep the PRC at bay, a desperate measure the United
States has so far dissuaded Taiwan from pursuing. Others still would
encourage Taipei to hold out as long as possible.

The economic costs of undermining the Taiwanese people's confidence in
their own security would be huge, and negotiating a peaceful, mutually
acceptable unification in such an environment would be nearly
impossible. To finish the job, China would almost certainly be forced to
resort to coercive measures---precisely the expensive and risky
undertaking Chinese leaders are hoping to avoid. And even if its
coercive measures succeeded in winning the Taiwan government's
acquiescence, integrating 23 million sullen and terrified Taiwanese into
the PRC would be yet another daunting and expensive project. US security
assistance stabilizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait by reassuring the
Taiwanese people and justifying Beijing's decision to be patient.

Should the United States Oppose Peaceful Unification?

Arguments like these often are misread as justifications for
containment, attempts to use Taiwan to prevent China from increasing its
national power and status. In reality, although some advocates of
containment do include Taiwan in their strategic thinking, a policy that
supports Taipei's efforts to craft a relationship with the PRC that
serves both sides' interests is not anti-China. Since Richard Nixon's
first visit to China in 1972, the United States has been steadfastly
agnostic on the question of unification. Nixon said, "We will support
any peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue that can be worked
out."\[11\]

Nor does the current US policy militate against China's long-term goal
of unification. The United States has never taken a position as to how
the cross-strait relationship ultimately should be resolved. Instead, it
holds that any outcome is acceptable, so long as the two sides arrive at
it through a peaceful, mutual, and noncoercive process. Washington has
made clear that Beijing should not bully Taiwan and Taiwan should not
provoke or insult the PRC. During the administration of Taiwan's
President Chen Shui-bian, US officials forcefully reminded the country's
leaders to respect Beijing's bottom lines and avoid gratuitous offense
or unilateral action. When cross-strait tensions eased under President
Ma Ying-jeou, US officials were quick to express encouragement for the
warming trend.

Although the United States has an interest in seeing Taiwan's future
decided peacefully and democratically, it does not want to block Taiwan
from forging a permanent peace---or even unifying---with mainland China.
Today, few in Taiwan believe Beijing is prepared to offer a unification
proposal that would preserve their democratic system, but if it were to
offer such a deal in the future, they might well support it. And if they
did, nothing in such an arrangement would be inconsistent with the
interests of other nations, including the United States, assuming the
PRC did not use Taiwan's territory as a base for expanding its military
reach in the western Pacific.

Much Ado about Nothing?

Critics of existing US Taiwan policy resist the characterization that
they advocate "abandoning" Taiwan. All of the individuals cited in this
article made clear that Taiwan's democracy is valuable and should be
encouraged. As Admiral Owens put it, "We must always protect the
democracy and freedoms Taiwan has developed, but weapons sales do not do
this."\[12\] But how can the United States protect and encourage
Taiwan's democracy while cutting off security assistance? The critics
square this circle with a key assumption: the PRC has no desire to
dismantle Taiwan's democratic system or restrict the Taiwanese people's
freedom, so the whole enterprise of Taiwan "holding out" against the PRC
is much ado about nothing. Unfortunately, the evidence to support this
assumption is scant.

Chas Freeman argues unification is compatible with Taiwan's democracy
because the PRC leadership says so: "American priorities look all the
more inverted when one considers that Beijing has offered to negotiate
what amounts to purely symbolic reunification with Taiwan, forgoing any
political or military presence of its own on the island. This offer
cannot be dismissed as incredible."\[13\] He offers Hong Kong and Macau
as proof of Beijing's "willingness to tolerate amazingly different
politico-economic orders on what is nominally its territory."\[14\]

Readers will have their own views of how well Hong Kong is faring
fifteen years into its fifty years of promised autonomy, but it is not
hard to fathom why many in Taiwan are skeptical about China's offer. To
give just one example, the PRC has trotted out various formulations of
its "One China Principle" in conversations with Taiwanese officials,
some of them quite generous, implying that Taiwan and the mainland are
both parts of a China that is not defined by either state. In the
international arena, however, the One China Principle has not changed.
It states there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China,
and the sole legal government and international representative of China
is the People's Republic. A key PRC policy document, "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue," confirms, "the government of the PRC
naturally should fully enjoy and exercise China's sovereignty, including
its sovereignty over Taiwan."\[15\] How can Taiwan agree to the One
China Principle when the definitions are so slippery?

Gilley offers a different rationale for why Taiwan need not fear the
PRC. Americans, he argues, fundamentally misunderstand China's domestic
politics when they believe "that Beijing is motivated by nationalism and
that the PRC's irredentist claims to Taiwan stem from a broader national
discourse of humiliation and weakness . . . \[and that it is\] striving
to reincorporate Taiwan into China in order to avert a domestic
nationalist backlash and a crisis of legitimacy."\[16\] Gilley dismisses
this interpretation. He says Chinese leaders have long since
relinquished an ideologically charged view of Taiwan and that today
"both sides have embraced a view of security that is premised on
high-level contact, trust, and reduced threats of force."\[17\]

The real driver of China's policy, says Gilley, is geostrategic. Beijing
wants to dominate its offshore regions, and it wants to ensure that
Taiwan cannot "serve as a base for foreign military operations against
China \[or\] . . . constrain Beijing's ability to develop and project
naval power and ensure maritime security in East Asia." Taiwan is a
problem for Beijing in this regard only if it is aligned with the United
States. A Finlandized Taiwan poses no threat, since China's concern is
"with Taiwan's geostrategic status, not with the precise nature of its
political ties to China."\[18\] Therefore, unification (or Gilley's idea
of Finlandization) need not impinge on Taiwan's domestic autonomy at
all. In the near term, meanwhile, Gilley says that dropping arms sales
might cause China to scale back military preparations aimed at Taiwan.

The problem with these arguments is that they are based on an analytical
judgment that cannot be proven. Certainly it makes sense today that
Beijing would not want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs by
blowing up the underpinnings of Taiwan's success, nor does it have any
interest in scaring its other neighbors, many of which are already on
edge. But how long will this logic prevail? After Finlandization, what
happens if Chinese nationalists flood the streets of Beijing demanding
"real" unification? What happens if a crowd starts singing Taiwan's
national anthem during a joint appearance of the PRC president and his
Taiwanese counterpart? Will "autonomy" require limiting what Taiwanese
citizens say and publish? Once China "fully enjoys and exercises its
sovereignty over Taiwan," as the PRC white paper put it, what steps can
other nations take to defend Taiwan's democracy? With so many questions
still open, it is not hard to see why so few in Taiwan are ready to take
Beijing's promises at face value.

Taiwan's ability to have its independence recognized internationally is
nil and growing niller every day, but China's ability to force its will
on Taiwan is strong and growing stronger. In other words, the issue
motivating Beijing's deterrence policy is already moot, but the factor
driving Taiwan's arms purchases is anything but. China's arms buildup
continues unabated, and its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally
has diminished only marginally. In this context, asking a weak Taiwan to
surrender its self-defense capabilities on faith that China will play
nicely seems the very definition of "oddly misguided" thinking.

Gilley, Glaser, Freeman, and Owens believe arms sales are the driver for
China's military buildup opposite Taiwan. But that buildup has continued
uninterrupted through periods of arms sales and periods when arms sales
were suspended; it continued under Sinophobic Taiwanese presidents and
is continuing now under the most proengagement president Taiwan has ever
seen. The evidence suggests China's military posture has its own logic,
which in turn suggests that a change in US policy would do little to
alter it.

Foreign Affairs published several letters criticizing the Gilley and
Glaser articles, especially the two authors' sanguine view of China's
military deployments. Both authors published rejoinders to their critics
in which they made critical concessions. In Gilley's words, "If China
were to reduce its threat to Taiwan by promising verifiable and
immediate force reductions, as well as by allowing Taipei to continually
expand its role in international organizations, Taiwan may decide that
participating in U.S. military planning, purchasing major weapons
systems from the United States, and denying offshore naval security to
China are no longer worth it. However, an implicit U.S. promise to
intervene in the event of any invasion of Taiwan would be necessary in
order for Taipei to choose to change course" (emphasis added).\[19\]
Glaser made a similar concession, writing, "The United States could stop
selling arms to Taiwan but maintain its pledge to defend Taiwan should
China launch an unprovoked attack; it could continue to sell Taiwan arms
but make clear that it will not intervene on Taiwan's behalf should a
conflict occur, even if Taiwan did not provoke it; or it could link its
continued support to the Taiwanese government's willingness to refrain
from moving toward independence."\[20\]

Both authors, in other words, admitted that some kind of US security
guarantee was necessary for Taiwan: in exchange for ending arms sales,
the United States would need to make an implicit (or explicit) "promise
to intervene." Three serious problems with this line of argument exist.
First, in the absence of arms sales, a promise to intervene might not be
credible. Could the United States mount a successful defense of Taiwan
if the island had been disarmed? Second, such a policy invites envelope
pushing on both sides of the strait. America's decades-old policy of
strategic ambiguity is based on the idea that keeping the two sides
guessing about how the United States will react in a crisis restrains
Taiwan's tendency toward recklessness and Beijing's tendency toward
aggression. Gilley and Glaser are recommending the United States ditch
that policy.

Finally, trading arms sales for a promise of intervention would
completely undermine the thrust of Gilley and Glaser's original
articles. On what basis can we conclude that such a policy would be any
less offensive to China than America's current policy? Indeed, Beijing
would probably find the promise of direct military intervention even
more of an intrusion into China's domestic affairs than arms sales. And
surely such a change in US policy would only accelerate the development
Freeman is most concerned about, an expensive and destabilizing race for
military dominance between the United States and the PRC.

Taiwan as an End in Itself

Critics of America's Taiwan policy couch their arguments in terms of US
national interests. Up to this point, I have responded to their
arguments in the same terms. But I am not content to limit the debate to
American interests, because I believe US policy should take into account
what is at stake for Taiwan, too. Of course, the United States cannot
allow its policy to be driven by Taiwan's interests or its people's
preferences, but Americans should at least inform themselves about what
could be lost if Washington changes its policy. Taiwan and its people
may serve as means to American ends, but we should acknowledge their
right---a right shared by all people---to be recognized as ends in
themselves.

The Taiwanese people treasure their democratic achievements and their
personal freedom. They also love their island homeland. Still, most
recognize and acknowledge their Chinese roots. It is not inconceivable
that the two sides could negotiate a form of unification that protects
Taiwan's political system and honors its unique position in China's
past, present, and future. A loose confederation would not please
hard-line unificationists in China or hard-line independentistas in
Taiwan, but it might satisfy moderates on both sides. Maintaining
peaceful interactions between the two sides, interactions that enhance
their mutual interests and build cross-strait confidence, is the most
sensible near-term goal.

The United States and other countries have no interest in encouraging
conflict in the Taiwan Strait; on the contrary, given the deep
interdependence among the PRC, Taiwan, and the global economy,
instability in the strait would be a catastrophe for everyone. But
lasting peace and stability cannot be built on a foundation of
might-makes-right. China's leaders and people are understandably proud
of their accomplishments in recent decades. The PRC's fast-growing
economic power and international influence give Beijing both the means
and the will to prevent outsiders from intruding and interfering in
matters it defines as core interests. But this capability does not
predetermine the choices Beijing will make regarding Taiwan. The PRC has
great latitude in how it handles its relations with Taiwan.

Taiwan offers proof that development---both political and economic---is
possible, but its experience reveals how fragile states' independence
really is. It shows that the autonomy most nations take for granted
ultimately rests on the forbearance of the strong or on wobbly balances
of power that, when they shift, leave states defenseless. In one sense,
Taiwan is extremely unlucky: thanks to Chinese nationalists on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, it lost its chance at full independence. In
another sense, though, it is lucky: unlike the many countries that have
seats in the United Nations but are at the mercy of political and
economic forces that make life miserable, Taiwan is wealthy, successful,
and protected for now by powerful friends. Taiwan is able to mobilize
others to support its survival, if not its sovereignty. Turning away
from Taiwan is a decision the United States should not make lightly. We
all have too much to lose.

#### Taiwan key to American maintenance in Asia

Chinese control of Taiwan would, among other things, sever the sea lanes
than connect Japan and its ally, the United States.

[Hostile control of Taiwan which enabled projection of naval and air
power from its territory would dramatically erode the United States'
ability to defend Japan]{.underline}. American bases on Okinawa would
become less defensible and more vulnerable to embargo or attack. The
ability of the United States Navy to secure the sea lanes around Japan
would be called into question. This would raise doubts not only about
the defense of Japan, but the security of the maritime routes connecting
Japan to the economies of Southeast Asia, India, the Persian Gulf, and
Central Asia.

Okinawa serves not only as the frontline defense of Japan, but as the
hub of American power projection into Southeast Asia. [Hostile control
of Taiwan would geographically sever the primary base of U.S.
expeditionary forces in Asia from strategic regions]{.underline} like
the South China Sea and the Indo-Malaysian archipelago. Asian states
that have sought closer security ties with the United States, including
Indonesia and Vietnam, might reconsider their strategic choices should
Taiwan move from being a facilitator to an obstacle to U.S. power
projection in maritime Southeast Asia.

The freedom of maneuver that U.S. air and naval forces enjoy in East and
Southeast Asia --- [the basis for American primacy and the prosperity it
has underwritten in this vast region]{.underline} --- would be
meaningfully constrained should the air and maritime commons around
Taiwan come under contestation. In short, [the operation of the U.S.
alliance system in Asia, and the reassurance American forward-deployed
forces have offered Asian partners for decades, could be
overturned]{.underline} [if Taiwan flipped from friendly to unfriendly

the consequences for the world economy would be crippling.

The United States Factor in Taiwan's Security Reliance on the United
States has been the constant element of Taiwan's security strategy. The
Taiwan Relations Act provided Taipei confidence in the United States
even after the termination of the U.S.-ROC mutual defense treaty[. On
the American side of the coin, concern for Taiwan's security has lasted
through several administrations due to the political support Taiwan
enjoys in the United States and the knowledge that Asian allies and
partners treat Taiwan as a larger litmus test of U.S.
resolve.]{.underline} Finally, [Beijing was long discouraged from
attacking Taiwan because of the risk that capable U.S. armed forces
would intervene to protect Taiwan]{.underline}. Washington does not,
however, explicitly commit itself to Taiwan's defense. To do so would
only unnecessarily complicate relations with China. Instead [U.S.
officials cite the Taiwan Relations Act, speak in general terms about
Washington's "abiding interest" in peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait, and reiterate opposition to either side's unilaterally changing
the status quo---without saying how the United States would respond to
such an attempt.]{.underline} Despite the ambiguity of public American
rhetoric, the capabilities that the PRC has acquired to complicate any
U.S. intervention suggest that it assumes the [United States will in
fact act to defend Taiwan.]{.underline} Beijing looks at both American
words and deeds to assess its intentions. The other significant element
of the post-1979 U.S.-Taiwan security partnership was sales of advanced
military equipment, which continued even after Washington established
diplomatic relations with Beijing and ended the defense treaty with
Taiwan. The level of arms sales has been relatively high over the last
two decades. In the first term of the Obama administration, for example,
the United States transferred over \$12 billion in weaponry to Taiwan.
For many years, however, [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan had as much a
political purpose as military one]{.underline}. Both in Beijing and
Taipei, these transfers were regarded as a signal of U.S. commitment to
Taiwan's security. To be sure, advanced platforms like the F-16s that
the George H.W. Bush administration announced in 1992 certainly improved
Taiwan's capabilities. But aside from U.S. support, the main reason that
Taiwan remained militarily secure was the PLA's relative backwardness,
not Taiwan's strength. That quality gap began to shrink in the late
1990s. [The one area of U.S.-Taiwan security relations that was dormant
until the mid-1990s was interaction between the two militaries on
everything except arms sales. As China-Taiwan relations deteriorated in
that period, the Clinton administration took steps to restore
interaction between the two military establishments. If the United
States might actually have to come to Taiwan's defense, it would need
contacts within the Taiwan military to de-conflict responses.
Reportedly, those contacts have "nearly doubled in recent
years."]{.underline}5

Establishing a presence in the South China Sea is about more than
prestige and power.

[Several claimants are trying to take control of fishing rights
and]{.underline} potentially much more valuable, yet [unproven, oil and
gas reserves deep beneath the water]{.underline}. The Chinese government
maintains that the vast majority of any resources in the South China Sea
belong to Beijing, and has disrupted attempts by Vietnam to explore its
own waters off its shores.

[Controlling access to the South China Sea would also give the holder
power over one of the world\'s most valuable trading routes, conferring
huge influence to whichever country dominates its waters]{.underline}.
The sea hosts one-third of global shipping, worth more than \$3 trillion
in 2016, [according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies'
(CSIS) China Power
Project](https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/).
That included \$874 billion of Chinese exports, as well as \$125 billion
in US imports to the region.

More than 80% of trade to and from Vietnam and Indonesia passes through
the sea, according to CSIS figures. It\'s also an important access point
to the Strait of Malacca, a narrow shipping passage which gives access
to the Indian Ocean and trade with countries beyond.

However, [it\'s not just resources and trading routes that are
motivating the US to challenge China\'s dominance in the region. If the
South China Sea were effectively closed to American ships and aircraft
by an increasingly powerful Chinese military, it would limit US
effectiveness as a world power]{.underline}.

China's rapid expansion in the South China Sea is the realization of a
dream by the country's leader, Xi Jinping.

In April, standing on the deck of the [Chinese]{.underline} destroyer
Changsha in the South China Sea, Xi reviewed one of the largest displays
of Chinese military might in the country's history. It was a stunning
display of naval power by a nation that has invested vast sums of money
to modernize its outdated fleet.

Its [shipbuilding capacity is accelerating rapidly]{.underline} \-- the
Chinese navy launched its second aircraft carrier in April 2017, while a
third one is rumored to be under construction. On a single day in July
2018, China launched two new, highly sophisticated destroyers to join
its impressive fleet. [The expansion of the country\'s fleet and rapid
militarization of artificial islands sends a clear message to China\'s
rivals in the region \-- the South China Sea is now firmly under its
control.]{.underline}

[The United States says Beijing has broken a promise made to former US
President Barack Obama in 2015 not to militarize its artificial
islands]{.underline}. Washington is leading a coalition of other nations
to regularly conduct freedom of navigation operations in the sea to
demonstrate the right of passage through international waters. [China
says the American presence demonstrates why it needs to deploy more
troops and military hardware to the South China Sea. It says it needs to
prepare to defend itself in the region.]{.underline}

[\"The US military presence by the South China Sea far exceeds the total
military strength of China and other littoral countries,\"]{.underline}
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in May. \"Does
the US truly want the freedom of navigation entitled under the
international law? Or does it just want the freedom to do whatever it
likes as a hegemon?\"

[The standoff between Washington and Beijing in the South China Sea has
regional powers on edge. They fear a miscalculation could lead to
accidental war]{.underline}. However[, neither the US nor China is
likely to back down]{.underline}. According to China's state media,
President Xi Jinping told US Secretary of Defense James Mattis in June
that "any inch of territory passed down from ancestors cannot be lost."
US commanders say they've kept these waters open for five decades, and
they won't stop now. These US Navy flights will continue, challenging
Beijing's expansion, with no end in sight.

The vitriolic exchange constituted a worrisome escalation of the
animosity between Taipei and Beijing that has been roiling for the past
three years. The victory of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in Taiwan's 2016 elections dashed any hopes Chinese leaders
had that the burgeoning economic ties with the mainland would translate
gradually into increased Taiwanese popular support for political
reunification. [Anger at that strategy's failure led Beijing to revive a
campaign to increase Taiwan's diplomatic isolation]{.underline} by
poaching the few small nations that still maintain formal relations with
Taipei. [The PRC's menacing military activities also increased. Chinese
war games in and around the Taiwan Strait have soared since
2016.]{.underline} The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019 report to
Congress also concludes that Beijing is building up its ground, air, and
naval forces to achieve a more robust capability to invade Taiwan.

[Anger at Beijing's treatment of Taiwan has led to congressional and
executive branch measures to strengthen Washington's backing for
Taipei]{.underline}. A major step occurred in March 2018 when President
Trump signed into law [the Taiwan Travel Act (TTA), which encouraged
high-level U.S. officials to meet with their Taiwan
counterparts]{.underline}. That legislation, which passed both houses of
Congress, ended Washington's cautious practice under the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA) of holding meetings only with relatively low-level
Taiwanese officials.

It was especially noticeable that the TTA specifically promoted
interaction by "cabinet-level national security officials." That
provision proved to be more than a symbolic gesture when [National
Security]{.underline} [Adviser John Bolton met with Taiwan National
Security Council Secretary-General David Lee in May]{.underline}.
Bolton's intention to push for stronger security ties between the United
States and Taiwan cannot be overstated. Before his current stint in
government service, he pushed for highly dangerous and provocative
policies. [He urged the United States to establish formal diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and even advocated moving U.S. military forces
from Okinawa to Taiwan.]{.underline} Either measure would cross a bright
red line as far as Beijing is concerned and would likely trigger PRC
military action to prevent Taiwan's permanent political separation from
the mainland. [Having someone with those views holding a crucial policy
post and sitting just a few doors down from the Oval Office greatly
increases the likelihood of a further boost in U.S. support for Taiwan,
despite the risk of war with China.]{.underline}

There are multiple signs from various sources of growing U.S. backing
for Taiwan's de facto independence. Congress certainly is stepping up
its support. By a unanimous voice vote in early May, the House of
Representatives passed the Taiwan Assurance Act, which expresses firm
support for Taiwan while urging Taipei to increase its own defense
spending. [The legislation also recommends that Washington continue
"regular sales of defense articles" to Taiwan and back Taipei's
participation in international organizations---something Beijing
emphatically resists.]{.underline}

The Trump administration doesn't seem to need much prodding. U.S.
warships have transited the Taiwan Strait on several occasions over the
past year to demonstrate military support for Taipei. At the Shangri-La
Dialogue session, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan stated
that [the United States would no longer "tiptoe around" destabilizing
Chinese behavior regarding Taiwan or the South China Sea]{.underline}.

[While Americans are focused on the ongoing trade war between the United
States and China, the danger is growing of an actual shooting war that
could involve Taiwan.]{.underline} The rhetoric coming out of both
Beijing and Taipei is increasingly confrontational and shrill. Taiwan's
governing party is firmly committed to resisting the PRC's pressure for
unification; indeed, incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen is being
challenged by an even more hardline, pro-independence faction within the
DPP. At the same time, Chinese leaders seem intent on pushing their
reunification agenda with greater insistence and urgency.

Those are not comforting trends. Washington has a vague but very real
commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to protect the island's
security. Both Congress and the [Trump administration seem to be
drifting toward boosting the traditional level of U.S. support in
response to Beijing's escalating pressure on Taiwan]{.underline}. The
danger is growing that the TRA's paper security commitment may be put to
a real-world test. U.S. leaders and the American people need to ask
themselves whether they are really willing to risk war with a
nuclear-armed power to protect Taiwan. The prudent answer clearly should
be "no."

#### Escalation leads to war

**Talmadge '18** (Caitlin Talmadge, Associate Professor of Security
Studies at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown
University, "Beijing's Nuclear Option", Foreign Affairs,
November/December 2018,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-15/beijings-nuclear-option)q

As China's power has grown in recent years, so, too, has the risk of war
with the United States. Under President Xi Jinping, [China has increased
its political and economic pressure on Taiwan and built military
installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea, fueling
Washington's fears that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S. allies
and influence in the region.]{.underline} U.S. destroyers have transited
the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from Beijing. American policymakers
have wondered aloud whether they should send an aircraft carrier through
the strait as well. Chinese fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft
in the skies above the South China Sea. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald
Trump has brought long-simmering economic disputes to a rolling boil.

[A war between the two countries remains unlikely, but the prospect of a
military confrontation---resulting, for example, from a Chinese campaign
against Taiwan---no longer seems as implausible as it once
did.]{.underline} And the odds of such a confrontation going nuclear are
higher than most policymakers and analysts think.

Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere
between nil and zero."

This assurance is misguided. If deployed against China, the Pentagon's
preferred style of conventional warfare would be a potential recipe for
nuclear escalation. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States'
signature approach to war has been simple: punch deep into enemy
territory in order to rapidly knock out the opponent's key military
assets at minimal cost. But the Pentagon developed this formula in wars
against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a
nuclear power.

China, by contrast, not only has nuclear weapons; it has also
intermingled them with its conventional military forces, making it
difficult to attack one without attacking the other. This means that a
major U.S. military campaign targeting China's conventional forces would
likely also threaten its nuclear arsenal. Faced with such a threat,
Chinese leaders could decide to use their nuclear weapons while they
were still able to.

As U.S. and Chinese leaders navigate a relationship fraught with mutual
suspicion, they must come to grips with the fact that a conventional war
could skid into a nuclear confrontation. Although this risk is not high
in absolute terms, its consequences for the region and the world would
be devastating. As long as the United States and China continue to
pursue their current grand strategies, the risk is likely to endure.
This means that leaders on both sides should dispense with the illusion
that they can easily fight a limited war. They should focus instead on
managing or resolving the political, economic, and military tensions
that might lead to a conflict in the first place.

A NEW KIND OF THREAT

There are some reasons for optimism. For one, China has long stood out
for its nonaggressive nuclear doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in
1964, China largely avoided the Cold War arms race, building a much
smaller and simpler nuclear arsenal than its resources would have
allowed. Chinese leaders have consistently characterized nuclear weapons
as useful only for deterring nuclear aggression and coercion.
Historically, this narrow purpose required only a handful of nuclear
weapons that could ensure Chinese retaliation in the event of an attack.
To this day, China maintains a "no first use" pledge, promising that it
will never be the first to use nuclear weapons.

The prospect of a nuclear conflict can also seem like a relic of the
Cold War. Back then, the United States and its allies lived in fear of a
Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly overrunning Europe. NATO stood ready to
use nuclear weapons first to stalemate such an attack. Both Washington
and Moscow also consistently worried that their nuclear forces could be
taken out in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear strike by the other side. This
mutual fear increased the risk that one superpower might rush to launch
in the erroneous belief that it was already under attack. Initially, the
danger of unauthorized strikes also loomed large. In the 1950s, lax
safety procedures for U.S. nuclear weapons stationed on NATO soil, as
well as minimal civilian oversight of U.S. military commanders, raised a
serious risk that nuclear escalation could have occurred without
explicit orders from the U.S. president.

The good news is that these Cold War worries have little bearing on
U.S.-Chinese relations today. Neither country could rapidly overrun the
other's territory in a conventional war. Neither seems worried about a
nuclear bolt from the blue. And civilian political control of nuclear
weapons is relatively strong in both countries. What remains, in theory,
is the comforting logic of mutual deterrence: in a war between two
nuclear powers, neither side will launch a nuclear strike for fear that
its enemy will respond in kind.

[The bad news is that one other trigger remains: a conventional war that
threatens China's nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} [Conventional forces can
threaten nuclear forces in ways that generate pressures to
escalate---]{.underline}especially when ever more capable U.S.
conventional forces face adversaries with relatively small and fragile
nuclear arsenals, such as China. [If U.S. operations endangered or
damaged China's nuclear forces, Chinese leaders might come to think that
Washington had aims beyond winning the conventional war---that it might
be seeking to disable or destroy China's nuclear arsenal
outright]{.underline}, perhaps as a prelude to regime change. In the fog
of war, [Beijing might reluctantly conclude that limited nuclear
escalation---an initial strike small enough that it could avoid
full-scale U.S. retaliation]{.underline}---was a viable option to defend
itself.

STRAIT SHOOTERS

[The most worrisome flash point for a U.S.-Chinese war is Taiwan.
Beijing's long-term objective of reunifying the island with mainland
China]{.underline} is clearly in conflict with Washington's longstanding
desire to maintain the status quo in the strait. It is not difficult to
imagine how this might lead to war. For example, China could decide that
the political or military window for regaining control over the island
was closing and launch an attack, using air and naval forces to blockade
Taiwanese harbors or bombard the island. [Although U.S. law does not
require Washington to intervene in such a scenario, the Taiwan Relations
Act states that the United States will]{.underline} "consider any effort
to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means,
including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security
of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States."
[Were Washington to intervene on Taipei's behalf, the world's sole
superpower and its rising competitor would find themselves in the first
great-power war of the twenty-first century.]{.underline}

In the course of such a war, U.S. conventional military operations would
likely threaten, disable, or outright eliminate some Chinese nuclear
capabilities---whether doing so was Washington's stated objective or
not. In fact, if the United States engaged in the style of warfare it
has practiced over the last 30 years, this outcome would be all but
guaranteed.

Consider submarine warfare. China could use its conventionally armed
attack submarines to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bomb the island, or
to attack U.S. and allied forces in the region. If that happened, the
U.S. Navy would almost certainly undertake an antisubmarine campaign,
which would likely threaten China's "boomers," the four nuclear-armed
ballistic missile submarines that form its naval nuclear deterrent.
China's conventionally armed and nuclear-armed submarines share the same
shore-based communications system; a U.S. attack on these transmitters
would thus not only disrupt the activities of China's attack submarine
force but also cut off its boomers from contact with Beijing, leaving
Chinese leaders unsure of the fate of their naval nuclear force. In
addition, nuclear ballistic missile submarines depend on attack
submarines for protection, just as lumbering bomber aircraft rely on
nimble fighter jets. If the United States started sinking Chinese attack
submarines, it would be sinking the very force that protects China's
ballistic missile submarines, leaving the latter dramatically more
vulnerable.

Even more dangerous, U.S. forces hunting Chinese attack submarines could
inadvertently sink a Chinese boomer instead. After all, at least some
Chinese attack submarines might be escorting ballistic missile
submarines, especially in wartime, when China might flush its boomers
from their ports and try to send them within range of the continental
United States. Since correctly identifying targets remains one of the
trickiest challenges of undersea warfare, a U.S. submarine crew might
come within shooting range of a Chinese submarine without being sure of
its type, especially in a crowded, noisy environment like the Taiwan
Strait. Platitudes about caution are easy in peacetime. In wartime, when
Chinese attack submarines might already have launched deadly strikes,
the U.S. crew might decide to shoot first and ask questions later.

Adding to China's sense of vulnerability, the small size of its
nuclear-armed submarine force means that just two such incidents would
eliminate half of its sea-based deterrent. Meanwhile, any Chinese
boomers that escaped this fate would likely be cut off from
communication with onshore commanders, left without an escort force, and
unable to return to destroyed ports. If that happened, China would
essentially have no naval nuclear deterrent.

The situation is similar onshore, where any U.S. military campaign would
have to contend with China's growing land-based conventional ballistic
missile force. Much of this force is within range of Taiwan, ready to
launch ballistic missiles against the island or at any allies coming to
its aid. Once again, U.S. victory would hinge on the ability to degrade
this conventional ballistic missile force. And once again, it would be
virtually impossible to do so while leaving China's nuclear ballistic
missile force unscathed. Chinese conventional and nuclear ballistic
missiles are often attached to the same base headquarters, meaning that
they likely share transportation and supply networks, patrol routes, and
other supporting infrastructure. It is also possible that they share
some command-and-control networks, or that the United States would be
unable to distinguish between the conventional and nuclear networks even
if they were physically separate.

[To add to the challenge, some of China's ballistic missiles can carry
either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, and the two versions are
virtually indistinguishable to U.S. aerial surveillance.]{.underline} In
a war, targeting the conventional variants would likely mean destroying
some nuclear ones in the process. Furthermore, sending manned aircraft
to attack Chinese missile launch sites and bases would require at least
partial control of the airspace over China, which in turn would require
weakening Chinese air defenses. But degrading China's coastal air
defense network in order to fight a conventional war would also leave
much of its nuclear force without protection.

Once China was under attack, its leaders might come to fear that even
intercontinental ballistic missiles located deep in the country's
interior were vulnerable. For years, observers have pointed to the U.S.
military's failed attempts to locate and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles
during the 1990--91 Gulf War as evidence that mobile missiles are
virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the thinking goes, China
could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what harm U.S. forces
inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research suggests otherwise.
Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles are larger and less mobile
than the Iraqi Scuds were, and they are harder to move without
detection. The United States is also likely to have been tracking them
much more closely in peacetime. As a result, China is unlikely to view a
failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as reassurance that its
residual nuclear force is safe today, especially during an ongoing,
high-intensity conventional war.

China's vehement criticism of a U.S. regional missile defense system
designed to guard against a potential North Korean attack already
reflects these latent fears. Beijing's worry is that this system could
help Washington block the handful of missiles China might launch in the
aftermath of a U.S. attack on its arsenal. That sort of campaign might
seem much more plausible in Beijing's eyes if a conventional war had
already begun to seriously undermine other parts of China's nuclear
deterrent. It does not help that China's real-time awareness of the
state of its forces would probably be limited, since blinding the
adversary is a standard part of the U.S. military playbook.

Put simply, the favored U.S. strategy to ensure a conventional victory
would likely endanger much of China's nuclear arsenal in the process, at
sea and on land. Whether the United States actually intended to target
all of China's nuclear weapons would be incidental[. All that would
matter is that Chinese leaders would consider them
threatened.]{.underline}

LESSONS FROM THE PAST

At that point, the question becomes, How will China react? Will it
practice restraint and uphold the "no first use" pledge once its nuclear
forces appear to be under attack? Or will it use those weapons while it
still can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt the U.S.
campaign or intimidate Washington into backing down?

Chinese writings and statements remain deliberately ambiguous on this
point. It is unclear which exact set of capabilities China considers
part of its core nuclear deterrent and which it considers less crucial.
For example, if China already recognizes that its sea-based nuclear
deterrent is relatively small and weak, then losing some of its
ballistic missile submarines in a war might not prompt any radical
discontinuity in its calculus.

The danger lies in wartime developments that could shift China's
assumptions about U.S. intentions. [If Beijing interprets the erosion of
its sea- and land-based nuclear forces as a deliberate effort to destroy
its nuclear deterrent, or perhaps even as a prelude to a nuclear attack,
it might see limited nuclear escalation as a way to force an end to the
conflict. For example, China could use nuclear weapons to
instantaneously destroy the U.S. air bases that posed the biggest threat
to its arsenal.]{.underline} It could also launch a nuclear strike with
no direct military purpose---on an unpopulated area or at sea---as a way
to signal that the United States had crossed a redline.

If such escalation appears far-fetched, China's history suggests
otherwise. In 1[969, similar dynamics brought China to the brink of
nuclear war with the Soviet Union.]{.underline} In early March of that
year, Chinese troops ambushed Soviet guards amid rising tensions over a
disputed border area. Less than two weeks later, the two countries were
fighting an undeclared border war with heavy artillery and aircraft.
[The conflict quickly escalated beyond what Chinese leaders had
expected, and before the end of March, Moscow was making thinly veiled
nuclear threats to pressure China to back down.]{.underline}

[Chinese leaders initially dismissed these warnings, only to radically
upgrade their threat assessment once they learned that the Soviets had
privately discussed nuclear attack plans]{.underline} with other
countries. [Moscow never intended to follow through on its nuclear
threat, archives would later reveal, but Chinese leaders believed
otherwise]{.underline}. On three separate occasions, they were convinced
that a Soviet nuclear attack was imminent[. Once, when Moscow sent
representatives to talks in Beijing, China suspected that the plane
transporting the delegation was in fact carrying nuclear weapons.
Increasingly fearful, China test-fired a thermonuclear weapon in the Lop
Nur desert and put its rudimentary nuclear forces on alert---a dangerous
step in itself, as it increased the risk of an unauthorized or
accidental launch.]{.underline} Only after numerous preparations for
Soviet nuclear attacks that never came did Beijing finally agree to
negotiations.

China is a different country today than it was in the time of Mao
Zedong, but the 1969 conflict offers important lessons. China started a
war in which it believed nuclear weapons would be irrelevant, even
though the Soviet arsenal was several orders of magnitude larger than
China's, just as the U.S. arsenal dwarfs China's today. Once the
conventional war did not go as planned, the Chinese reversed their
assessment of the possibility of a nuclear attack to a degree bordering
on paranoia[. Most worrying, China signaled that it was actually
considering using its nuclear weapons, even though it had to expect
devastating retaliation.]{.underline} Ambiguous wartime information and
worst-case thinking led it to take nuclear risks it would have
considered unthinkable only months earlier. This pattern could unfold
again today.

KEEP THEM GUESSING

Both the United States and China can take some basic measures to reduce
these dangers. More extensive dialogue and exchange---formal and
informal, high level and working level, military and political---could
help build relationships that might allow for backchannel de-escalation
during a conflict. The two countries already have a formal military hot
line in place, although it does not connect political leaders. A
dedicated and tested infrastructure for senior military and political
leaders to reliably and easily communicate during wartime would provide
at least one off-ramp in the event of a crisis.

But better communication can only do so much for a problem that
ultimately stems from military doctrine and grand strategy. Given that
the United States' standard wartime playbook is likely to back China
into a nuclear corner, it would be logical for Washington to consider
alternative strategies that would leave China's nuclear capabilities
untouched. For example, some analysts have proposed coercing China
through a distant naval blockade, and others have suggested confining
any U.S. campaign to air and naval operations off China's coast. The
goal in both cases would be to avoid attacks on the Chinese mainland,
where the bulk of Chinese nuclear forces reside.

The problem with these alternatives is that the mainland is also [where
the bulk of Chinese conventional capabilities are located. The United
States is unlikely to voluntarily leave these capabilities intact, given
its predilection for reducing its own casualties and rapidly destroying
enemy forces]{.underline}. If China is using its mainland bases to lob
ballistic missiles at U.S. troops and allies, it is hard to imagine a
U.S. president ordering the military to hold back in the interest of
de-escalation. U.S. allies are particularly unlikely to accept a
cautious approach, as they will be more exposed to Chinese military
power the longer it is left intact. [No one wants a U.S.-Chinese war to
go nuclear, but a U.S. campaign that avoids escalation while letting
China's conventional forces turn Taiwan---not to mention Japan or South
Korea---into a smoking ruin would not seem like much of a victory
either.]{.underline}

[Of course, Beijing could also take steps to ameliorate the problem, but
this is just as unlikely. China has chosen to mount both conventional
and nuclear warheads on the same missiles and to attach both
conventional and nuclear launch brigades to the same bases.]{.underline}
It likely sees some strategic advantage in these linkages. Precisely
because these entanglements raise the prospect of nuclear escalation,
Beijing may believe that they contribute to deterrence---that they will
make the United States less likely to go to war in the first place.

But just as China benefits if the United States believes there is no
safe way to fight a war, the United States benefits if China believes
that war would result not only in China's conventional defeat but also
in its nuclear disarmament. In fact, the United States might believe
that this fear could give it greater leverage during a conflict and
perhaps deter China from starting one at all.

In short, [neither side may see much value in peacetime reassurance.
Quite the opposite: they may be courting instability]{.underline}. If
this is the case, however, then U.S. and Chinese leaders should
recognize the tradeoffs inherent in their chosen policies. [The threat
of escalation may make war less likely, but it also makes war radically
more dangerous if it does break out.]{.underline} This sobering reality
should encourage leaders on both sides to find ways of resolving
political, economic, and military disputes without resorting to a war
that could rapidly turn catastrophic for the region and the world.

### 2nc -- at -- china militarizing fast

#### The US is remilitarizing to keep up with China

**Klare 6/5**/19 (Michael T. Klare, The Nation's defense correspondent,
professor emeritus of peace and world security studies at Hampshire
College and senior visiting fellow at the Arms Control Association in
Washington, DC, "The US Military Is Preparing for a New War", The
Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/us-military-is-preparing-for-new-wars-china-russia/)

After years of slogging it out with guerrillas and jihadists across the
Greater Middle East, [the US military is increasingly keen on preparing
to combat "peer" competitors China and Russia, countries that pose
what's called a "multi-domain" challenge to the United States. This new
outlook is only bolstered by a belief that America's never-ending war on
terror has severely depleted its military]{.underline}, something
obvious to both Chinese and Russian leaders who have taken advantage of
Washington's extended preoccupation with counterterrorism to modernize
their forces and equip them with advanced weaponry.

For the United States to remain a paramount power---so Pentagon thinking
now goes---it must turn away from counterterrorism and focus instead on
developing the wherewithal to decisively defeat its great-power rivals.
This outlook was made crystal clear by then--Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April
2018. ["The negative impact on military readiness resulting from the
longest continuous period of combat in our nation's history \[has\]
created an overstretched and under-resourced military," he
insisted.]{.underline} Our rivals, he added, used those same years to
invest in military capabilities meant to significantly erode America's
advantage in advanced technology. [China, he assured the senators, is
"modernizing its conventional military forces to a degree that will
challenge U.S. military superiority." In response, the United States had
but one choice: to reorient its own forces for great-power
competition.]{.underline} "Long-term strategic competition---not
terrorism---is now the primary focus of US national security."

This outlook was, in fact, already enshrined in the National Defense
Strategy of the United States of America, [the Pentagon's overarching
blueprint governing all aspects of military planning. Its \$750 billion
budget proposal for fiscal year 2020, unveiled on March 12th, was said
to be fully aligned with this approach. "The operations and capabilities
supported by this budget will strongly position the US military for
great-power competition for decades to come,"]{.underline} acting
Secretary of Defense Shanahan said at the time.

In fact, in that budget proposal, the Pentagon made sharp distinctions
between the types of wars it sought to leave behind and those it sees in
its future. ["Deterring or defeating great-power aggression is a
fundamentally different challenge than the regional conflicts involving
rogue states and violent extremist organizations we faced over the last
25 years," it noted. "The FY 2020 Budget is a major milestone in meeting
this challenge," by financing the more capable force America needs "to
compete, deter, and win in any high-end potential fight of the
future."]{.underline}

GIRDING FOR "HIGH-END" COMBAT

If such a high-intensity war were to break out, Pentagon leaders
suggest, it would be likely to take place simultaneously in every domain
of combat---air, sea, ground, space, and cyberspace---and would feature
the widespread utilization of emerging technologies, such as artificial
intelligence (AI), robotics, and cyberwarfare. To prepare for such
multi-domain engagements, the 2020 budget includes \$58 billion for
advanced aircraft, \$35 billion for new warships---the biggest
shipbuilding request in more than 20 years---along with \$14 billion for
space systems, \$10 billion for cyberwar, \$4.6 billion for AI and
autonomous systems, and \$2.6 billion for hypersonic weapons. You can
safely assume, moreover, that each of those amounts will be increased in
the years to come.

Planning for such a future, Pentagon officials envision clashes first
erupting on the peripheries of China and/or Russia, only to later extend
to their heartland expanses (but not, of course, America's). As those
countries already possess robust defensive capabilities, any conflict
would undoubtedly quickly involve the use of front-line air and naval
forces to breach their defensive systems---which means the acquisition
and deployment of advanced stealth aircraft, autonomous weapons,
hypersonic cruise missiles, and other sophisticated weaponry. In
Pentagon-speak, these are called anti-access/area-defense (A2/AD)
systems.

As it proceeds down this path, the Department of Defense is already
considering future war scenarios. A clash with Russian forces in the
Baltic region of the former Soviet Union is, for instance, considered a
distinct possibility. So the United States and allied NATO countries
have been bolstering their forces in that very region and seeking
weaponry suitable for attacks on Russian defenses along that country's
western border.

[Still, the Pentagon's main focus is a rising China, the power believed
to pose the greatest threat to America's long-term strategic interests.
"China's historically unprecedented economic development has enabled an
impressive military buildup that could soon challenge the U.S. across
almost all domains,"]{.underline} Adm. Harry Harris Jr., commander of
the Pacific Command (USPACOM) and now the US ambassador to South Korea,
typically testified in March 2018. "China's ongoing military
modernization is a core element of China's stated strategy to supplant
the U.S. as the security partner of choice for countries in the
Indo-Pacific."

As Harris made clear, [any conflict with China would probably first
erupt in the waters off its eastern coastline and would involve
an]{.underline} [intense US drive to destroy China's A2/AD
capabilities]{.underline}, rendering that country's vast interior
essentially defenseless. Harris's successor, Adm. Philip Davidson, as
commander of what is now known as the US Indo-Pacific Command, or
USINDOPACOM, described such a scenario this way in testimony before
Congress in February 2019[: "Our adversaries are fielding advanced
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems, advanced aircraft, ships,
space, and cyber capabilities that threaten the US ability to project
power and influence into the region."]{.underline} To overcome such
capabilities, he added, the United States must develop and deploy an
array of attack systems for "long-range strike\[s\]" along with
"advanced missile defense systems capable of detecting, tracking, and
engaging advanced air, cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic threats from
all azimuths."

If you read through the testimony of both commanders, you'll soon grasp
one thing: that the US military---or at least the Navy and Air
Force---are focused on a future war-scape in which American forces are
no longer focused on terrorism or the Middle East, but on employing
their most sophisticated weaponry to overpower the modernized forces of
China (or Russia) in a relatively brief spasm of violence, lasting just
days or weeks. These would be wars in which the mastery of technology,
not counterinsurgency or nation building, would---so, at least, top
military officials believe---prove the decisive factor.

THE PENTAGON'S PREFERRED BATTLEGROUND

[Such Pentagon scenarios essentially assume that a conflict with China
would initially erupt in the waters of the South China Sea or in the
East China Sea near Japan and Taiwan.]{.underline} US strategists have
considered these two maritime areas America's "first line of defense" in
the Pacific since Adm. George Dewey defeated the Spanish fleet in 1898
and the United States seized the Philippines. Today, USINDOPACOM remains
the most powerful force in the region with major bases in Japan,
Okinawa, and South Korea. China, however, has visibly been working to
erode American regional dominance somewhat by modernizing its navy and
installing along its coastlines short- and medium-range ballistic
missiles, presumably aimed at those US bases.

[By far its most obvious threat to US dominance in the region, however,
has been its occupation and militarization of tiny islands in the South
China Sea]{.underline}, a busy maritime thoroughfare bounded by China
and Vietnam on one side, Indonesia and the Philippines on the other. [In
recent years, the Chinese have used sand dredged from the ocean bottom
to expand some of those islets, then setting up military facilities on
them, including airstrips, radar systems, and communications
gear]{.underline}. In 2015, China's President Xi Jinping promised
President Obama that his country wouldn't take such action, but
satellite imagery clearly shows that it has done so. While not yet
heavily fortified, those islets provide Beijing with a platform from
which to potentially foil US efforts to further project its power in the
region.

"These bases appear to be forward military outposts, built for the
military, garrisoned by military forces, and designed to project Chinese
military power and capability across the breadth of China's disputed
South China Sea claims," Admiral Harris testified in 2018. ["China has
built a massive infrastructure specifically---and solely---to support
advanced military capabilities that can deploy to the bases on short
notice."]{.underline}

To be clear, US officials have never declared that the Chinese must
vacate those islets or even remove their military facilities from them.
However, for some time now, they've been making obvious their
displeasure over the buildup in the South China Sea. In May 2018, for
instance, Secretary of Defense Mattis disinvited the Chinese navy from
the biennial "Rim of the Pacific" exercises, the world's largest
multinational naval maneuvers, saying that "there are consequences" for
that country's failure to abide by Xi's 2015 promise to Obama. "That's a
relatively small consequence," he added. "I believe there are much
larger consequences in the future."

What those consequences might be, Mattis never said. [But there is no
doubt that the US military has given careful thought to a possible clash
in those waters and has contingency plans in place to attack and destroy
all the Chinese facilities there.]{.underline} American warships
regularly sail provocatively within a few miles of those militarized
islands in what are termed "freedom of navigation operations," or
FRONOPS, while US air and naval forces periodically conduct large-scale
military exercises in the region. Such activities are, of course,
closely monitored by the Chinese. Sometimes, they even attempt to impede
FRONOPS operations, leading more than once to near-collisions. In May
2018, Admiral Davidson caused consternation at the Pentagon by
declaring, "China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in
all scenarios short of war with the United States"---a comment
presumably intended as a wake-up call, but also hinting at the kinds of
conflicts US strategists foresee arising in the future.

#### US militarizing globally now

**Sjursen '18** (Danny Sjursen, US Army strategist and former history
instructor at West Point, "The United States Is Militarizing the Globe",
The Nation, 11/21/18,
https://www.thenation.com/article/pentagon-united-states-military-worldwide-global-war/)

CHALLENGING THE DRAGON: THE FUTILE QUEST FOR HEGEMONY IN ASIA

The United States Navy has long treated the world's oceans as if they
were American lakes. Washington extends no such courtesy to other great
powers or nation-states. Only now, the US Navy finally faces some
challenges abroad---especially in the Western Pacific. [A rising China,
with a swiftly growing economy]{.underline} and carrying grievances from
a long history of European imperial domination, [has had the audacity to
assert itself in the South China Sea. In response, Washington has
reacted with panic and bellicosity.]{.underline}

Never mind that the South China Sea is Beijing's Caribbean (a place
where Washington long felt it had the right to do anything it wanted
militarily). Heck, the South China Sea has China in its name! The US
military now claims---with just enough truth to convince the
uninformed---[that China's growing navy is out for Pacific, if not
global, dominance. S]{.underline}ure, at the moment China has only two
aircraft carriers, one an old rehab (though it is building more)
compared to the US Navy's 11 full-sized and nine smaller carriers. [And
yes, China hasn't actually attacked any of its neighbors yet. Still, the
American people are told that their military must prepare for possible
future war with the most populous nation on the planet.]{.underline}

In that spirit, it has been forward deploying yet more ships, Marines,
and troops to the Pacific Rim surrounding China. Thousands of Marines
are now stationed in Northern Australia; US warships cruise the South
Pacific; and Washington has sent mixed signals regarding its military
commitments to Taiwan. Even the Indian Ocean has recently come to be
seen as a possible future battleground with China, as the [US Navy
increases its regional patrols there and Washington negotiates stronger
military ties with China's rising neighbor, India. In a symbolic
gesture, the military recently renamed its former Pacific Command
(PACOM) the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM).]{.underline}

Unsurprisingly, China's military high command has escalated accordingly.
They've advised their South China Sea Command to prepare for war, made
their own set of provocative gestures in the South China Sea, and also
threatened to invade Taiwan should the Trump administration change
America's longstanding "One China" policy.

From the Chinese point of view, all of this couldn't be more logical,
given that [President Trump has also unleashed a "trade war" on
Beijing's markets and intensified his anti-China rhetoric. And all of
this is, in turn, consistent with the Pentagon's increasing
militarization of the entire globe.]{.underline}

NO LAND TOO DISTANT

Would that it were only Africa, Asia, and Europe that Washington had
chosen to militarize. But as Dr. Seuss might have said: That is not all,
oh no, that is not all. In fact, more or less every square inch of our
spinning planet not already occupied by a rival state has been deemed a
militarized space to be contested. [The United States has long been
unique in the way it divided the entire surface of the globe into
geographical (combatant) commands]{.underline} presided over by generals
and admirals who functionally serve as regional Roman-style proconsuls.

And the Trump years are only accentuating this phenomenon. Take Latin
America, which might normally be considered a non-threatening space for
the United States, though it is already under the gaze of US Southern
Command (SOUTHCOM). Recently, however, having already threatened to
"invade" Venezuela, President Trump spent the election campaign rousing
his base on the claim that a desperate caravan of Central American
refugees---hailing from countries the United States had a significant
responsibility for destabilizing in the first place---was a literal
"invasion" and so yet another military problem. As such, he ordered more
than 5,000 troops (more than currently serve in Syria or Iraq) to the
US-Mexico border.

Though he is not the first to try to do so, he has also sought to
militarize space and so create a possible fifth branch of the US
military, tentatively known as the Space Force. It makes sense. War has
long been three dimensional, so why not bring US militarism into the
stratosphere, even as the US Army is evidently training and preparing
for a new cold war (no pun intended) with that ever-ready adversary,
Russia, around the Arctic Circle.

If the world as we know it is going to end, it will either be thanks to
the long-term threat of climate change or an absurd nuclear war. In both
cases, Washington has been upping the ante and doubling down. On climate
change, of course, the Trump administration seems intent on loading the
atmosphere with ever more greenhouse gases. When it comes to nukes,
rather than admit that they are unusable and seek to further downsize
the bloated US and Russian arsenals, that administration, like Obama's,
has committed itself to the investment of what could[, in the end, be at
least \$1.6 trillion over three decades for the full-scale
"modernization" of that arsenal]{.underline}. Any faintly rational set
of actors would long ago have accepted that nuclear war is unwinnable
and a formula for mass human extinction. As it happens, though, we're
not dealing with rational actors but with a defense establishment that
considers it a prudent move to withdraw from the Cold War era
Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia.

And that ends our tour of the US military's version of Planet Earth.

It is often said that, in an Orwellian sense, every nation needs an
enemy to unite and discipline its population. [Still, the United States
must stand alone in history as the only country to militarize the whole
globe (with space thrown in) in preparation for taking on just about
anyone. Now, that's exceptional.]{.underline}

#### US militarizing -- air, sea, land, water to prevent the fire nation from attacking

**Burns 3/16**/19 (Robert Burns, Associated Press for PBS News Hour,
"New U.S. military budget focused on China despite border talk", PBS
News Hour,
<https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/new-us-military-budget-focused-on-china-despite-border-talk>)

WASHINGTON --- Chinese bombers. Chinese hypersonic missiles. Chinese
cyberattacks. Chinese anti-satellite weapons.

[To a remarkable degree, the 2020 Pentagon budget proposal is shaped by
national security threats that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan
has summarized in three words: "China, China, China."]{.underline}

The U.S. is still fighting small wars against Islamic extremists, and
Russia remains a serious concern, but Shanahan seeks to shift the
military's main focus to what he considers the more pressing security
problem of a rapidly growing Chinese military.

This theme, which Shanahan outlined Thursday in presenting the
administration's proposed 2020 defense budget to the Senate Armed
Services Committee, is competing for attention with narrower, more
immediate problems such as President Donald Trump's effort to use the
military to build a border wall.

The hearing, for example, spent more time on the wall and prospects for
using military funds to build parts of it than on any aspect of foreign
policy, including the conflict in Syria or military competition with
China, Russia or North Korea.

Shanahan is hardly the first defense chief to worry about China. Several
predecessors pursued what the Obama administration called a "pivot" to
the Pacific, with China in mind. [But Shanahan sees it as an
increasingly urgent problem that exceeds traditional measures of
military strength and transcends partisan priorities.]{.underline}

"We've been ignoring the problem for too long," Shanahan told a senator.

["China is aggressively modernizing its military, systematically
stealing science and technology, and seeking military advantage through
a strategy of military-civil fusion," he wrote in prepared testimony to
the committee, which is considering a \$718 billion Pentagon budget
designed in part to counter China's momentum.]{.underline}

[The \$25 billion the Pentagon is proposing to spend on nuclear weapons
in 2020, for example, is meant in part to stay ahead of China's nuclear
arsenal, which is much smaller than America's but growing. Shanahan said
China is developing a nuclear-capable long-range bomber]{.underline}
that, if successful, would enable China to join the United States and
Russia as the only nations with air-, sea- and land-based nuclear
weapons.

[Shanahan ticked off a list of other Chinese advancements --- hypersonic
missiles against which the U.S. has limited defenses]{.underline};
[space launches and other space efforts that could enable it to fight
wars in space; "systematically stealing" of U.S. and allied technology,
and militarizing land features in the South China Sea.]{.underline}

Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, says the U.S. has been lacking
effective strategies for competing with China on a broad scale.

"It is overdue," she said of the Shanahan focus. "We have been somewhat
slow in catching up" in such areas as denying China its regional
ambitions, including efforts to fully control the South China Sea, which
is contested by several other countries.

Some defense analysts think Shanahan and the Pentagon have inflated the
China threat.

"I do think it's worth asking what exactly is threatening about China's
behavior," said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. He doesn't discount China
as a security issue, including in the South China Sea, but doubts the
U.S. military is the institution best suited to deal with such
non-military problems as cyber intrusions into American commercial
networks.

In Preble's view, competition with the Chinese is not mainly military.
"I still don't believe the nature of the threat is quite as grave as
we're led to believe" by the Pentagon, he said. "They tend to exaggerate
the nature of the threat today."

In his previous role as deputy defense secretary, Shanahan and President
Donald Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, crafted a national
defense strategy that put China at the top of the list of problems.

["As China continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting
power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to
pursue a military modernization program that seeks Indo-Pacific regional
hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to
achieve global pre-eminence in the future," that strategy document
says.]{.underline}

[That explains in part why the U.S. is spending billions more on space,
including means of defending satellites against potential Chinese
attack, and on building hypersonic missiles to stay ahead of Chinese and
Russian hypersonic weapons development.]{.underline}

It also explains some of the thinking behind preparing for an early
retirement of the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier, a strategy that
views carriers as a less relevant asset in a future armed conflict
involving China.

This concern about countering China has permeated the entire U.S.
military. Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, said last
month that dozens of African heads of state were invited to Beijing last
fall to consider billions in Chinese loans and grants, and that China is
building thousands of miles of railroads in Africa, mostly linked to
Chinese mineral extraction operations.

"They're heavily invested and heavily involved" in Africa, he said.

The top U.S. commander in Europe told Congress this week that China also
is making inroads in Europe.

"China is looking to secure access to strategic geographic locations and
economic sectors through financial stakes in ports, airlines, hotels,
and utility providers, while providing a source of capital for
struggling European economies," Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti said.

#### The US will always be militarily superior to China

**The Cipher Brief 7/19**/19 (The Cipher Brief, founded by former CNN
Intelliency Correspondent Suzanna Kelley with goal of delivering global
security news, written by experts in the field and minimizes biases,
"Chinese Military Modernization and Implications for Taiwan", The Soufan
Center,

Earlier this month, China tested the 'Guam Killer,' an
intermediate-range ballistic missile with the capability to strike U.S.
bases and vessels in the Pacific, immediately spurring debates about the
potential for a Sino-American military showdown.[China is spending an
increasing amount of resources on modernizing and enhancing the
capability of its military.]{.underline} Due to low levels of
transparency, estimating China's military spending proves hard, but
figures from the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database show that over the
last decade, China has increased its defense spending more than
five-fold. The goal, according to Chinese president Xi Jinping, is to
have a 'world-class force' by 2050.

Even with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) being down-sized to 2
million troops, [China still boasts the largest military in the world.
Xi's reforms are focused on transforming the Chinese military into a
modern force with an advanced degree of readiness, both on land and in
the maritime domain.]{.underline} China has taken significant steps in
realizing that goal, especially by ramping up its naval power. Examples
include: introducing the new J-20 stealth fighter jet, building its
first aircraft carrier, and establishing its first overseas military
base in Djibouti[. The military modernizations have been coupled with
increasing Chinese aggression abroad. In the South China Sea, Beijing
has claimed thousands of acres to construct artificial islands, several
of which now possess the capability of docking ships and providing a
landing area for airplanes]{.underline}. To ensure domination of these
strategic islands, Beijing has not shied away from making its intentions
clear, continuing territorial disputes with neighboring countries.
Building strategic port infrastructure abroad, such as the Port of Sri
Lanka and the Gwadar Port in Pakistan, breathes life into the
geopolitical theory of China's 'string of pearls' strategy---China's
military and commercial network in key strategic locations in the Indian
Ocean, spanning from China to the Horn of Africa.

[Such developments have spurred much debate and comparison]{.underline}
about Chinese military capability vis-à-vis the United States. While
China is working to close the gap[, the United States is still a far
more dominant military power than China according to nearly every
metric]{.underline}. U.S. maritime power still outrivals that of China,
and [although Beijing recently acquired an aircraft carrier, Washington
possesses twenty-four of them]{.underline}. The U.S. maintains an
offensive nuclear doctrine compared to China's, which is mostly
defensive[. Moreover, the U.S. arsenal features more than 30 times the
number of deployed nuclear warheads compared to China (1,350 compared to
45).]{.underline} Perhaps, most notably, the Chinese military has never
been deployed in a conventional war in the 21stCentury. The U.S.
military, on the other hand, has been battle tested with increasing
regularity since the end of the Cold War. While China is the largest
contributor to United Nations Peacekeeping forces, which offers some
operational experience for PLA troops, it cannot be compared to any of
[the United States' battlefield experiences over the last two decades.
Lastly, the U.S. has something China fundamentally lacks---a strong and
powerful alliance system that spans the globe.]{.underline}

[The most immediate threat that should concern U.S. policymakers and
defense officials, however, is the Chinese military's capability to
reunite Taiwan with the mainland by force.]{.underline} In past years,
Beijing's rhetoric and actions regarding the 'One China' policy and
reunification have grown increasingly assertive. In Xi Jinping's New
Year's address, he called for peaceful reunification, but warned: "We
make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of
taking all necessary means." In the last year, China dispatched its
Aircraft carrier to enter Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ) and held a military drill in the Taiwan Strait. Both actions can
be interpreted as threatening to Taiwan. Many believe the Belt and Road
Initiative will be President Xi's most important legacy when in reality
it is the reunification of Taiwan. If Xi would successfully reunite
Taiwan with the mainland---either peacefully or by force---he almost
certainly will achieve the same leadership status as Mao Zedong. Western
policymakers underestimate the importance of Taiwan to China, the CCP,
and Xi Jinping. Besides, the Trump administration has done little to
assuage American allies, including Taiwan, who have become concerned
about a reduced American role in Asia[. The U.S. military will always be
an effective deterrent, but questions over the political will to protect
longstanding allies have emerged during what many view as a foreign
policy of retrenchment.]{.underline} [Xi may find that the next few
years provide a window of opportunity to achieve reunification with
increasing uncertainty over how, or even whether, the U.S. would
respond.]{.underline}

Structural Economics (INSE) at Peaking University, "U.S.-China
Relations: The Way Forward", CATO Institute, Winter 2019,
<https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/winter-2019/us-china-relations-way-forward>)Q

What Are the Options?

[There is no doubt that the United States and China are in a state of
strengthening competition]{.underline}; denying the potential
repercussion is like not seeing an elephant in the room. However, is war
or decoupling the only option? Even those who normally advocate force to
compel compliance should think twice in this case about alternatives or
consequential outcomes. China is not Nazi Germany, certainly not the
Soviet Union, and has no place on the so-called Axis of Evil that
President George W. Bush used to describe North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and
other governments that sponsored terrorism. [No other label would
justify the hostility toward China, a competitor/partner in economics
and politics of more than 40 years. The outdated American framework of
thinking of countries as either adversaries or alliance partners no
longer fits, especially in the case of China.]{.underline} It is time to
heed Paulson's advice that the stakes for the world are higher than ever
before, therefore "we need to craft a new framework that works for
today's world, not the world of the past" (Paulson 2018).

The current state of U.S.-China relations weighs heavily on people from
all sectors, including politicians, businessmen, and ordinary consumers.
Most would define the current impasse as historical, with unpredictable
outcomes, as friction may lead to direct conflict.

[China and the United States are two nations with very different
ideologies, demographics, social structures, economic development
patterns, and power projections based on very distinct global outlooks.
It is inevitable that they would need to address clashes in viewpoints
with more intensity and deliberation.]{.underline} The outcome could
lead to either conflict or partnership between two distinctive
development models. [Contemplating conflict may ultimately lead to war,
with the current trade war only a reminder of a much graver
situation.]{.underline} Maneuvering the differences toward partnership
would ultimately require intelligent people, and it would lead to a
peaceful resolution given time.

China and the United States are in different stages of development, and
their ideological perspectives clash. [Unfortunately, President Trump
overlooks these key distinctions and focuses simply on the balance of
trade and the size of the bilateral deficit with China. He thinks in
terms of a zero-sum game, with one winner (China) and one loser
(America). Moreover, he sees the trade imbalance as a threat to U.S.
national security.]{.underline} Is this the proper path to examine trade
and the overall relationship of two major world powers? Clearly not!

China will soon become the world's largest economic power in terms of
GDP in manufacturing and trade, mainly due to the size of its
population. Is China then becoming a threat? Only if the American
leaders would like to blindly believe so, or worse, if politicians twist
China's image into the "evil empire." GDP or trade figures do not
accurately represent the actual size of wealth or even power, they
merely illustrate that there are many hard-working Chinese. As there are
four times more people to feed in China than in the United States,
intelligent people would notice the rather "unproductiveness" of the
Chinese people on a per capita basis.

Henry Kissinger (2011) has dedicated an entire book on China
appropriately named On China. However, in a previous book focused on
U.S. foreign policy published just before the 9/11 attacks, he mentioned
China only twice in passing (Kissinger 2001). I asked him then why he
left out China in summarizing America's world outlook. He brushed that
aside and simply noted that it might not have been the right time to do
so. Yet, if that was not the right time then, was it when President
Obama in his 2010 State of the Union address declared that he did not
"accept second place for the United States," or when he announced his
"Pivot to Asia" strategy and the establishment of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP)? Was it the right time when President Trump declared
his trade war on China after abandoning the TPP? The rise of China is
real, and it will not be stopped. Americans need to examine China's rise
positively and devise comprehensive strategies accordingly, in order to
manage the coming new world order.

[The rise of China does not necessarily mean the fall of the United
States. Indeed, to assume that China's rise will necessarily be
accompanied by America's decline is inaccurate, if not ignorant ---
especially by using simply trade and GDP figures for calculation and
analysis. Many Americans did not foresee the rise of China, but to
further that error by accusing China of intentional diversion would be
irresponsible. Even if Americans had become aware of China's rise
earlier, any attempt to repress it would have been futile, just as
America's rise was inevitable, even if the Japanese fantasized that an
attack on Pearl Harbor would hold off the United States from the war in
Asia.]{.underline}

China's Rise

China's economic rise will remain the greatest challenge to America for
coming generations. How should the United States prepare for it? I
believe it is essential to confront the challenges with honesty and
openness, and to manage the generational challenges with confidence,
strength and perseverance --- just as the Chinese did when they were
challenged, even humiliated and defeated, in the past two centuries. The
Chinese people complained about the West and Japan's invasion and
occupation. However, they also spent time and effort on introspection to
recognize their own mistakes and weaknesses and then sought to
strengthen their country's defense through military modernization. China
did not exploit others in the process of growing its economy. As the
Analects state: "The man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established
himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself,
he seeks also to enlarge others."1

The economic rise of China should not be perceived as a threat, just as
the rise of the United States at the turn of the 20th century was not a
threat to Great Britain, Europe, or anyone else. Only to those who would
compare China to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union would the future seem
perilous. Zbigniew Brzezinski saw China's aspiration to world power as
"neither revolutionary nor messianic nor Manichean" (Brzezinski 2012:
78-79). He believed that China saw "the rapid decline of America's
global primacy would produce a global crisis that would devastate
China's own well-being and damage its long-range prospects."

Trade with China should not be perceived as a threat. U.S. consumers of
final and intermediate goods have benefited from China's opening to the
outside world. Imports from China have widened the range of choices open
to U.S. citizens and motivated more efficient production at home.
Moreover, focusing on bilateral trade deficits diverts attention from
the underlying weaknesses of the U.S. policy regime, in particular the
unsustainable long-run fiscal deficits driven by rapid growth in
entitlement spending, the unnecessary rise in defense spending, and tax
cuts. The United States should seriously consider economic structural
reform instead of empty talk by politicians. The worst threat would be
to believe that there is nothing wrong in the U.S. economy or that
American problems are caused by unscrupulous foreigners.

The "Belt and Road Initiative" is an attempt to strengthen other
economies so that China can benefit economically and foster peace in the
greater region. I believe the fundamental premise of western economic
thinking is not a zero-sum theory, and trade serves as an important
lever. Any economically motivated region would have a better chance of
fostering peace among members that trade with each other than an
isolated country with a significant wealth gap with its neighbors.

The Only Path Forward

[Trade works in different ways at different times with different
products and among different traders. Either negotiations or war tactics
can be used to resolve trade conflicts. In a civilized world,
negotiations are the only path forward. The negotiations approach to
settle trade disputes between the United States and China has worked
well up to now and will likely prevail in the future.]{.underline}

[Many authorities argue that the United States is ideologically
committed to its liberal capitalist system]{.underline}. However, they
do not want to openly admit that the United States is also driven by
power, national interest, and world leadership. The obsession in
Washington to hold on to the solo superpower status and the fear of
losing absolute power have created this current zealous guardian of
American national interest. Yet it is counterproductive to hyperinflate
U.S. leadership via military and economic might or even the poorly
defined "soft power." [The fate of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and
even Imperial China should serve as warning to those who indulge in the
dreams of an American empire. Indeed, the size of an economy, dominant
position of its currency, industrial strength, supremacy of its
technology, military budgetary resources, or the size of a nuclear
arsenal have never bestowed the crown on a superpower.]{.underline} As
Brzezinski (2012: 2-3) once warned, America simply cannot "retreat into
an ignorant garrison-state mentality or wallow in self-righteous
cultural hedonism" just when the world needs guidance on how to engage
with the "new East."

The influence of North Korea and Israel are good cases for the United
States to reexamine its definition of power. They are both small nations
enclosed in a hostile environment. With political and strategic
shrewdness, they have become regional powers that maintain geopolitical
balance in the best interest of their own survival. If we look back in
history, the fragility of the Soviet Union seemed unfathomable, but its
strong military force was defeated in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, in 1969,
China, with a very weak economy, had a border clash with the Soviet
Union prior to President Nixon's first visit to Beijing in 1972, and the
United States sought out China to jointly counter the Soviet threat.
These historical events are clear illustrations that the notion of a
superpower needs to be reexamined if not redefined. The 2008 financial
crisis struck when the United States was the world's only superpower.
America's superpower status did not prevent the 9/11 attacks, nor did it
allow the United States to achieve an easy victory in Afghanistan and
Syria. Likewise, the United States did not successfully prevent North
Korea from developing its nuclear capability, nor prevent Crimea from
becoming a part of Russia. The superpower status conundrum needs to be
reexamined.

[The largest structural issue between China and the United States is the
American obsession with its superpower status and the size of China's
population. With President Trump and the many ideologues around him,
such obsession could intensify as they prepare to confront a large
population of 1.4 billion on the rise.]{.underline}

[Americans failed to recognize the economic rise of China when it was so
evident. Indeed, the United States gets blindsided often, such as with
the rise of India and Africa. China is only the first of a whole string
of emerging economies that the United States will likely have to cope
with in the coming decades.]{.underline} As early as 1997, Brzezinski
declared, "America is not only the first, as well as the only, truly
global superpower, but it is also likely to be the very last"
(Brzezinski (1997: 209). This realization represents an opportunity for
economic growth and possibly a more harmonious world, rather than the
end of something great. Power never represents greatness, even if we
would welcome the humbling of one nation with the emergence of many. A
wrong assessment could give rise to costly consequences and derail the
trajectory of a great nation.

Most Americans know about the Cold War and how it ended. Our world does
not need another one. China is not the Soviet Union, and the United
States is also not the same 30 years later. China-U.S. trade and
people-to-people relationships are in no way comparable to the Cold War.
Unfortunately, there are politicians on both sides who cultivate fear
for their short-term advantages. The populist movement in the West is
where concern should be focused, and the October 2018 speech by Vice
President Pence on China is unfortunately a highly debated illustration
(see Pence 2018). Americans should remember how the wrath of McCarthyism
harmed its country after WWII and recall the lessons learned from wars
fought based on ideology. After many years of instability in Muslim
nations caused by the Arab Spring and the continuing war in Syria, there
is clearly no victory in sight for American interest. Vietnam remains
governed by the communist party and is trading with the United States,
after so much money spent and so many Americans killed during the war.
North Korea remains after so many decades of conflict, and the U.S.
president is still working hard to contain its threat.

[No matter what happens to the current trade conflict, the United States
and China are going to thrive in the next few decades. They will witness
other powers emerge, and possibly challenge whatever dominant position
they hold by then]{.underline}. We should not see such rising powers as
a threat, but as an economic opportunity. Without such external
stimulus, we may become complacent; just like what happened to imperial
China two centuries earlier, when Great Britain used its gunboats to
open up the Chinese market for opium trade, Americans believe China is
overtaking them in terms of wealth. However, threat and challenge are
not easily differentiated. It is also important not to mistake economic
or containable geopolitical challenge as strategic threat and, in turn,
overreact in military terms --- the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the
Syrian Civil War are examples. Russia is clearly less a threat to the
world compared to the Soviet Union. Maybe American strategic thinkers
should devise an alternative framework with which to view its
relationship with President Putin instead of narrowly identifying him as
an expansionist.

In his latest book, titled World Order, Kissinger declared, "The
reconstruction of the international system is the ultimate challenge to
statesmanship in our time," and "the affirmation of America's
exceptional nature must be sustained" (Kissinger 2014: 371, 373). Hank
Paulson also spoke of the negative consequences if the United States and
China fail to find a consensus: failure would lead to "systemic risk of
monumental proportions --- not just to the global economy, as I dealt
with, but to international order as we know it and to world peace"
(Paulson 2018). Such risk could only be managed if Washington and
Beijing provide "strong and wise leadership."

#### China won't cooperate -- reuniting Taiwan is the main desire

**The Economist 1/24**/19 (The Economist, weekly magazine/newspaper,
"China's might is forcing Taiwan to rethink its military strategy",
<https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/01/26/chinas-might-is-forcing-taiwan-to-rethink-its-military-strategy>)

[[Taiwan "must and will" be reunited with the mainland, declared
Xi]{.mark} Jinping, China's president, on January 2nd.]{.underline}
Chinese leaders have been saying such things since the retreating
Nationalists separated the island from the rest of the country after
losing the civil war to the Communists in 1949. [But Mr Xi has done more
than just talk: [he has sent bombers and warships to circle the
island]{.mark}, held live-fire drills in the narrow Taiwan Strait and,
Taiwanese generals say, instructed the People's Liberation Army (pla) to
be capable of seizing Taiwan by force by next year.]{.underline} Back in
1996, the most recent cross-strait crisis, China's military spending was
barely twice Taiwan's. Now it is 15 times greater. That has left
Taiwanese leaders rushing to rethink their defences.

Taiwan already does a great deal to make itself indigestible to
invaders. The island is "honeycombed with bunkers", says Ian Easton of
the Project 2049 Institute, an American think-tank. Tanks are hidden
away in bustling neighbourhoods of Taipei. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial
Highway Number One was built to handle not only rush-hour traffic, but
also ten-tonne fighter jets, since the island's airfields would quickly
be destroyed by Chinese missiles should war break out.

[[America]{.mark}, Taiwan's closest military ally, [has urged the island
to move further towards a "porcupine strategy"]{.mark}. It wants Taiwan
to acquire smaller, cheaper and more mobile weapons that could wear down
Chinese forces close to Taiwan's shores, in the place of big, lumbering
and expensive kit such as warplanes and battleships, which are better
suited to projecting firepower onto China's mainland.]{.underline}

Taiwanese planners have taken note. In 2017 the country's top military
officer launched the "Overall Defence Concept". That strategy, endorsed
by Tsai Ing-wen, the president, embraces the porcupine ethos. [One
priority is [intelligent sea mines]{.mark}, which can scoot around and
so evade sweeping]{.underline}. Some are more advanced than anything in
America's arsenal. Another focus is unmanned platforms, [such as
[remote-controlled sentry]{.mark} guns to guard outlying islands
[and]{.mark} armed drones to patrol the coastline]{.underline}. Third is
an [emphasis on [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taiwan is churning out
Hsiung Feng cruise missiles by the hundreds. [These can be placed not
only on small, zippy speedboats rather than bulky destroyers, but also
in unmarked lorries. Such rocket-laden vehicles are hidden "in places
you cannot imagine", says one official, and could continue to operate
from anywhere on the road network long after invaders had obliterated
Taiwan's fighter jets.]{.underline} Better yet, they are far cheaper
than warplanes.

Yet not everyone is willing to jettison traditional ways of war. The new
defence policy appeals to the president and her staff not only for its
military virtues, but also because it favours the smaller systems that
Taiwan can build itself. But the top brass has reasons beyond vanity to
defend their shiny objects.

They concede that heavy tanks, big ships and fancy warplanes may not
survive a head-to-head conflict with China. But they act as a deterrent
and boost morale. Missiles cannot fend off prowling Chinese bombers nor
speedboats patrol stormy oceans. "Parades are a form of deterrence,
certainly in Asia," notes Drew Thompson, who used to help shape policy
on Taiwan at America's Department of Defence. "Big-ticket items parade
well."

They also let Taiwan take the fight to China. Taiwan's American-made
frigates would eventually be blown out of the water, but not before
their potent torpedoes might inflict serious damage on Chinese ships.
That would not only boost the morale of islanders facing a hailstorm of
missiles, it might also induce caution in Mr Xi.

The problem is that showcase weapons are expensive. Even domestically
built submarines---Taiwan hopes to make eight---cost more than \$1bn
apiece; the entire annual defence budget is just \$11bn. Money is even
tighter because Taiwan is scrapping conscription and shifting to an
all-volunteer force. And since salaried soldiers are pricier, their
numbers are fewer. Taiwan's armed forces have shed more than 150,000
people since China's cross-strait muscle-flexing in 1996, leaving
215,000. The country's reserve force, its second line of defence, will
also shrink with every passing year. Even so, any return to compulsory
enlistment would be electoral suicide, politicians say.

American arms, even big, expensive ones at odds with the porcupine
philosophy, also serve a diplomatic purpose[. [America's involvement in
a war could be the difference between Taiwan's survival and
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Just eight American submarines could
sink 40% of China's amphibious fleet in the first week of fighting,
according to computer simulations by the rand Corporation, a
think-tank.]{.underline}

Although America does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it
maintains close ties. Some 3,500-4,000 Pentagon officials travel to
Taiwan every year, an average of more than ten per day. [[Arms sales
have totalled more than \$15bn since 2010. The relationship is
deepening]{.mark} in some respects.]{.underline} Arms transfers were
previously bundled into big packages that reliably aroused Chinese
anger; they are now growing more routine.

The administration of Donald Trump is stacked with senior officials who
know Taiwan well and sympathise with its plight. [Mr Trump delighted
Taiwan's leaders by holding a taboo-busting phone call with Ms Tsai when
he was president-elect. Last year he also signed the Taiwan Travel Act,
which encourages senior American officials to visit the island and vice
versa. [If arms sales help bolster America's commitment to Taiwan, so
much the better.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Though Mr Xi clearly feels obliged to continue to hound Taiwan about
reunification, he has thus far avoided laying down a firm timeline. The
relatively slow growth of China's amphibious fleet casts doubt on the
idea that the pla is working flat out to be ready to invade. Nor has it
been conducting big amphibious exercises. There is still time for Taiwan
to sharpen its quills.

#### China rise and US hyper-nationalism spur global powers' disputes. 

**Swaine 1/16** (Michael D. Swaine, 1-16-2019, Swaine is a senior fellow
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and one of the most
prominent American analysts in Chinese security studies \"A Relationship
Under Extreme Duress: U.S.-China Relations at a Crossroads,\" Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/16/relationship-under-extreme-duress-u.s.-china-relations-at-crossroads-pub-78159>)

The first trend emerged in the 1990s and 2000s and produced two serious
negative outcomes: severe damage to Beijing's reputation in the West,
which undermined expectations of China's continued reform and opening,
and [a [deepening of Chinese suspicions of the United States and other
democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}. These developments [stemmed from
Beijing's response to three major challenges to CCP rule: the collapse
of communist and authoritarian states, caused in part by the explosion
of rapid, internet-based forms of communication with freer societies;
the emergence of unprecedented levels of corruption and socioeconomic
disorder in China]{.underline} in the 2000s, largely as a result of
decades of market-led, rapid economic growth and the failure to develop
an effective legal system; and more dangerous forms of domestic
terrorism and unrest, occurring primarily in the ethnic minority areas
of Tibet and Xinjiang.

This [triple threat to CCP rule greatly heightened the insecurities of
China's leaders, prompting efforts to purge the party ranks, strengthen
overall party controls throughout Chinese society, and increase the
economic role of the state.]{.underline} Those changes began during the
Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao eras but have [intensified greatly under Xi
Jinping.]{.underline} Most recently, such perceived threats to the
Party's leadership have caused Xi to build up his personal position
within the party, thus undermining the gradual evolution of the Chinese
political system toward a more predictable, collective, and
institutionalized pattern of rule.

As a result of Beijing's actions, China's image among democratic states,
already damaged by the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, [declined much
further]{.underline}, as did [Western confidence in China's commitment
to pursue continued growth through greater opening, marketization, and
support for the rule of law.]{.underline} To compound this blow to the
relationship, [Chinese leaders have become more deeply suspicious of
Western (and especially U.S.) views and policies toward
China]{.underline}. Indeed, by the mid-1990s, the CCP leadership
concluded that Washington and other democratic nations had contributed
decisively to the collapse or weakening of one-party systems elsewhere
and might be seeking similar ends for the PRC regime. Such fears and
suspicions were magnified by the long-standing, deeply rooted sense of
resentment toward the West many Chinese feel as a result of China's
so-called "Century of Humiliation."

A second set of highly negative trends that emerged in the 2000s
involved domestic developments in the U.S. and the West, adding more
suspicions on both sides while also emboldening China's leaders in
potentially dangerous ways. Specifically, the 2008 global recession, the
deepening polarization of American society, and the resulting
near-paralysis of the U.S. political system in dealing with critical
domestic issues such as ballooning health care and entitlement costs and
huge government deficits created two negative consequences for the
U.S.-China relationship.

One is that many Chinese leaders somewhat tentatively concluded that the
United States had likely entered a period of systemic decline in which
America's ability to challenge or "contain" China's rise would drop
significantly, and the American model of pluralist democracy and
market-led economic growth would gradually lose its lustre.

This dual perception has strengthened the outlook of those within the
Chinese leadership, including Xi, who support a more confident use of
China's growing economic and military capabilities to push back against
Washington's supposed containment efforts and more vigorously defend or
advance Beijing's expanding interests overseas. This approach has
largely eclipsed the long-standing emphasis of the Deng Xiaoping era on
maintaining a relatively low international profile. [It has given
greater license to]{.underline} those within China [who prefer to give
vent more vigorously to long-held resentments against the
West,]{.underline} or against so-called "hostile Western forces,"
[usually referring to the United States.]{.underline}

[In the United States, such hyper-nationalism is reflected most
distinctively in the extremist views of President Trump.]{.underline} He
has criticized U.S. politicians and global corporations for selling out
U.S. workers, and the national interest in general, by their support for
unfair multilateral trade agreements and by moving manufacturing
facilities to foreign countries. Most notably for U.S.-China relations,
Trump and his supporters have singled out China for special denunciation
when they blast a range of other countries as economic predators or
cheaters that aim to enrich themselves at America's expense.

A third [major factor contributing to the overwhelming negative dynamics
emerging in U.S.-China relations is China's very rapid
growth]{.underline}, which has passed certain key thresholds. Over the
last eighteen years, [China has become the largest trading power in the
world]{.underline}, surpassed the Japanese economy to become the second
largest economic power overall, become a major source of innovation in
key high-tech sectors, accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves,
and transformed its military from a defense-oriented force focused
mainly on the homeland and Taiwan to a more expansive, sophisticated
force capable of operating at significant distances from China.

While contributing to global growth and the rise of living standards in
many countries, the systemic changes arising from these developments
have enhanced Chinese confidence abroad while greatly stoking American
fears. By some measures, China is now poised to equal America's military
footprint in the Western Pacific, which would effectively end seventy
years of U.S. maritime dominance in that critical region. In addition,
[Beijing is using its economic resources to create what it hopes will
become a vast network of interlinked economic structures and
relationships extending from China to Europe and Africa via both land
and maritime routes, the so-called Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI).]{.underline} It is also supporting or leading a variety of other
multilateral and bilateral economic and security initiatives\-\--such as
new investment banks, Asian economic associations, and strategic
partnerships with U.S. friends and adversaries alike\-\--that could
significantly shape the contours of the international system in new
directions. [Further, as mentioned above, China is more assertively
advancing, by economic, political, and military means, its claims to
disputed areas along its maritime periphery from Northeast to Southeast
Asia, thus alarming many nearby states.]{.underline}

#### Multitude of other threats to US-China relations, Taiwan not solely key.

**Swaine 1/16** (Michael D. Swaine, 1-16-2019, Swaine is a senior fellow
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and one of the most
prominent American analysts in Chinese security studies \"A Relationship
Under Extreme Duress: U.S.-China Relations at a Crossroads,\" Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/16/relationship-under-extreme-duress-u.s.-china-relations-at-crossroads-pub-78159>)

First: Areas of relations between the two countries: US--- Chinese
relations retained a reasonable degree of harmony and stability since
the Nixon policy--- Kissinger in the seventies of the last century, and
expressed clearly what is it called the \"Statement of Shanghai\", which
provides for the support of Washington to the presence of one country to
China, and considering Taiwan as an inalienable part of China,
Motherland, which helped to stabilize their relations, in addition to
that the dispute between China and the former Soviet Union, and until
the late eighties of the same century. With the start of shifts within
the Eastern bloc, and the beginning of the disintegration of the
security and economic structures of the Soviet camp, Washington has
become more liberal in its relationship with China, and less willing to
induce it which resulted the emerge of the [numerous points of
contention, that were clearly demonstrated in a number of
areas:]{.underline}

[1. The Two Koreas:]{.underline} The situation between the two Koreas,
[known as Korean crisis]{.underline} (where its roots are referred to
the fifties of the last century) and [still represents one of the most
prominent differences between the two countries]{.underline}, in light
of the increasing Beijing fears the aspirations and Washington\'s future
strategy and projects in regional areas of China, and at the level of
the Asian continent as a whole, in the light The new approach that was
adopted by the US President, Barack Obama, to be known as the principle
of Obama in US foreign policy, and of orientation to the east in order
to rebuild its power and influence in East Asia and the Pacific, which
[Beijing sees as a threat to its interests of regional influence in
addition to the fear of China of any US action regarding the
reunification of the Korean peninsula crisis to become one state loyal
to it, in light of the rapprochement between Washington and
Seoul.]{.underline} [Beijing is also worried about the serious negative
consequences that will affect it, as a result of any kind of escalation
against Pyongyang, especially since China\'s border with North
Korea]{.underline} extending 1415 km and parts of distance from rivers
that freeze in the winter that may turn it into a corridor for hundreds
of thousands of refugees North Koreans flooding it, including in turn
increases the turbulence faced by China. It is also difficult in this
context as well as the Chinese ignore public opinion and could exert
pressure on the government, that demands immediate and decisive response
to any challenge or threat to Chinese interests, or violation of the
sovereignty of Beijing in its beaches. Despite Washington\'s realization
that those fears are not observed it in directions about the recent
crisis in the Korean peninsula, where Washington has refused Beijing
diplomatic initiatives to contract a new round of negotiations between
the parties to calm the situation, without escalation punitive measures
against Pyongyang, in an attempt to briquetting pressure on Beijing, in
order to compel it to reduce its economic and military cooperation with
Pyongyang to tighten the isolation, recognizing that the real North
Korea isolation key remains in the hands of China[.]{.underline}

[2. Human Rights: Human rights record in China is one of the contentious
issues between the two countries]{.underline}, as US organizations
concerned with reports that revealed a significant deterioration in the
record, makes it adheres to the need to respect China to the values of
Western and international concepts prevailing for Human Rights, which
[opposes China for two main reasons from its point of view]{.underline},
The first is that [human rights is an internal affair]{.underline}, and
each country regulates its relationship to its nationals according to
what it sees[, and that the US goals of provoking such issues are
interfering in the internal affairs of States.]{.underline} The other
that [each independent privacy that stem from cultural specificity
state, historical, and cultural, and then it is not necessarily to meet
its concept of human rights and the Western concept or the US in this
regard, but that each country seeks to achieve progress in this area in
its own way]{.underline}, and according to circumstances. This issue has
seen a significant unit in the positions of the two countries,
especially since the last report on the Pentagon on \"the deterioration
of religious freedom in China\" in 2012, calling for the need to put it
on the list of countries of particular concern, which was met with
Chinese rejection of the view that intervention in its internal affairs,
calling on the US side to read the report of its record in the field of
human rights during the same year, and published by the Information
Office of China\'s State Council, where these reports represent an
aspect of the media war between the two sides and mutual
criticism[.]{.underline}

[3. Trade Issues:]{.underline} The trade relations between the two
countries were developed in a stable manner, and witnessed a progress at
a steady pace, despite what has been hampered by obstacles and
difficulties. The graph of the size of trade exchange between them is on
the rise has remained, where the size of trade has been doubled six
times in the period between 1990 and 2000, and reached the total foreign
trade volume of China in 2001 to more than US \$ 372 billion, of which
\$ 74.4 billion with the United States of America, any 20% added to that
the volume of transit trade with Hong Kong occupies 30%, of the United
States to become the first commercial partner of Chinaaccording to the
American side - where Chinese exports to the US amounted it to 21% of
the total Chinese exports statistics. According to the latest statistics
announced by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the total size of
commercial exchange between the two in 2012 reached to more than five
hundred billion US dollars. However, there is controversial issues in
this area were concentrated in three aspects, namely[: (A) Chinese
monetary policy, and the depreciation of the local currency exchange
rate, in an attempt to address the trade imbalance between the two
countries.]{.underline} US officials have attributed this imbalance to
the monetary policies pursued by the Chinese government to keep the
price of its currency low against the dollar, which led to the decline
in US exports, which in turn led to higher deficit in the trade balance,
to the extent that some members of the US Congress called for the
adoption of Project trade sanctions law aimed at countries that do not
fit its exchange rate with the fair value, in a clear reference to the
Chinese position. This has been rejected by the Chinese side,
considering this imbalance to several factors, notably: The
international division of labor, and economic globalization, and US
restrictions on high-tech exports to China, and the problems experienced
by the US economy that is carried at the savings rate of a high debt
ratio because of consumption, and high unemployment rate. [(B) US trade
protectionism against the US accusations of Chinese monetary policy,
where Beijing has accused Washington of following protectionist economic
policies against US imports from China, through the adoption of a
package of restrictive measures on Chinese trade]{.underline}, and in
particular the rising of customs value on the Chinese iron, which in
turn led to the loss of billions of dollars of Chinese exports, and
damage to the conditions of many of the companies operating in China,
and reflected on the escape of the capital investment[. (C) Intellectual
piracy practiced by Chinese companies and Chinese products of US
origin,]{.underline} and copying from the computer programs, and works
of art video and audio, books, and trademarks. Although the two
countries signed an agreement in March 1995 on the fight against piracy
of intellectual property, it is still frequently asked on a regular
basis[.]{.underline}

[4. Middle East: A new axis of the differences:]{.underline}
Historically, the China International attitudes and its vote pattern in
the United Nations, especially the UN Security Council, were close to
the Arab issues and contradictory with the pro-US foreign policy which
always goes with Israel. But in the past few years, substantial
convergence between the Jewish state and the China event, which limited
the political contradiction with the United States on the Palestinian
issue in particular. But, despite this convergence, it is still there as
of differentiation in their positions on other issues, mainly[: (A)
Sudan crisis:]{.underline} Where China\'s interest in the Black
Continent [is mainly due to the urgent need for China to secure reserves
of oil, far from the control of the United States.]{.underline}
Therefore, China has sought to forge closer ties with the ruling regime
in Khartoum, through its financing and construction of many
infrastructure projects in Sudan, and in return obtaining concessions
for the exploitation of the oil fields. It is noteworthy that China has
provided an international cover for Khartoum in the Security Council,
which has had the effect of tension in the relationship with the United
States. [(B) The Syrian crisis]{.underline}: It appears that is evident
contrast in the attitudes of the two countries with the start of the
Syrian Revolution, where China and Russia blocked making any decisions
to condemn the regime of Bashar Assad, or the imposition of any
effective sanctions against him, so opposing the American---western
orientation, despite the keenness of the two parties not to disturb this
differentiation the essence of relations. But, [if you understood the US
position against the Syrian regime, it is important to clarify China\'s
position, which could be interpreted in the light of three factors: 1.
Beijing fears that the regime in Syria comes along with the United
States]{.underline}, what weakens the Chinese presence in the region[.
2. The special nature of relations between them, the two capitals stand
out in support of each other\'s in important international
issues]{.underline} such as the occupied high Golan for Syria, the
issues of Taiwan, Tibet and human rights in the case of China on the
other hand[. 3. Maintain at the level reached by the economic relations
between them, which was strengthened in the past few years, as China is
currently one of the largest trade partners of Syria]{.underline}, the
second largest non-Arab investor in Syria. From the above, we can say
that China\'s effective role in the heart of the Middle East has been
formed as a new variable over the past two decades, and important part
of the special events of the region variables. Therefore, any analysis
of regional variables, under the current circumstances, it has become an
important turning point in the nature, size and the extent of China\'s
role in the Middle East[.]{.underline}

[5. USA cooperation with Taiwan]{.underline}: Taiwan\'s represents one
of the major themes that arose disagreement between both of them, due to
the feet of the United States on a new quality of dealings with the
government of Taiwan, which Beijing interprets as bearing fundamental
violation, a full giving up from the agreement between the two countries
in connection with the Taiwan issue since the seventies, where China
held that Such transactions from devoting the status of Taiwan\'s
secession. While recognizing the United States to the seriousness of
this issue to Beijing, they made sure to have a direct presence with
Taiwan through the conclusion of several agreements and treaties in
various fields, most recently on military cooperation between the two
parties agreement valued at \$ 5.6 billion, which included the US United
processing Taiwan helicopter model \"Block hook\", and Patriot missiles,
as well as other equipment relating to command and control of the
special, which angered Beijing and objection to the point of doing
summoned the US ambassador to inform him of its position, with the
suspension of military ties with Washington, warning of the impact on
any agreement for a regional solution to any conflict in the region. But
Washington was keen to calm the situation, confirming that this
equipment is purely defensive, and the lack of offensive elements,
emphasizing the words \"Philip Kavli,\" Assistant US Secretary of State,
that this step is not inconsistent with the \"Standard China policy\"
and that the United States is still committed of the previous
understandings between it and China in this regard[.]{.underline}

[6. Climate change: The US-Chinese disagreement on the fight against
global warming resulting from the manufacturing processes, and the
burning of fuel, and the escalation of toxic gases in the
air]{.underline}. While China sees as the need for the developed
countries bear the burden of the global pollution of the environment,
because it is the main cause of global warming, without having a
negative impact on the requirements of developing countries to achieve
comprehensive development, Western countries receive, and led by the
United States, the responsibility on everyone, the need to claim their
participation in carrying the results of these changes and response.

#### US escalation over China's human rights abuses

**Klein 3/14**/19 (Jodi Xu Klein, award-winning business journalist with
20 years of experience, has spent decade based in the US reporting for
The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, part of the Time Magazine team
that won the Henry R. Luce Award, breaking the China SARS story, "US
calls China one of the worst regimes for human rights in 2018 due to
'abuse and torture of Uygur Muslims in Xinjiang'", South China Morning
Post,
https://www.scmp.com/print/news/china/society/article/3001594/us-calls-china-one-worst-regimes-human-rights-2018)Q

[The United States identified China Wednesday as one of the worst
countries on the planet last year in terms of respecting the basic human
rights of its citizens.]{.underline}

The State Department's annual human rights report, released on
Wednesday, spotlighted [the Chinese government's systematic internment
and possible abuse and torture of as many as two million Uygur
Muslims]{.underline} in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
region in 2018.

The department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, published
for the 43rd year, aims to promote human rights globally, including
freedoms of religion or belief, expression, peaceful assembly and
association.

[The US has typically scored China in these reports for restricting
freedom of speech and assembly and for allowing or committing violence
against religious and ethnic groups.]{.underline} Last year, the report
called China, along with Russia, Iran and North Korea, "forces of
instability".

But on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing was "in
a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations".

"Official repression of the freedoms of speech, religion, movement,
association, and assembly of Tibetans in the Tibet autonomous region
(TAR) and other Tibetan areas and of Uygurs and other ethnic and
religious minorities in Xinjiang worsened and was more severe than in
other areas of the country," according to the 2018 report.

The report found that during 2018 the Chinese government "significantly
intensified its campaign of mass detention of members of Muslim minority
groups in Xinjiang".

[The authorities, it said, "have arbitrarily detained 800,000 to
possibly more than two million Uygurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims
in internment camps designed to erase religious and ethnic
identities".]{.underline}

News accounts have earlier reported that more than a million ethnic
Uygurs and other largely Muslim ethnic groups had been detained in
extrajudicial internment camps in the Xinjiang region since a crackdown
began in early 2017.

Last month, China was said to be lobbying to keep the issue off the
agenda of the main annual session of the United Nations' Human Rights
Council.

Chinese government officials claim that the camps are educational and
feature "training centres", and are needed to combat terrorism,
separatist movements and extremist activities.

[Also on Wednesday, the US co-hosted an event at the UN in Geneva,
Switzerland -- alongside Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Britain
-- calling for international organisations to make it a priority to put
to an end of the abuses in Xinjiang, the State Department
said.]{.underline}

At the event, according to the department, government officials and
survivors described the severity of the violations of human rights in
the northern Chinese region.

[In January, as part of a continuing effort to pressure China to stop
its crackdown, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers nominated the
imprisoned Uygur academic Ilham Tohti for the 2019 Nobel Peace
Prize.]{.underline}

["International media, human rights organisations, and former detainees
reported security officials in the camps abused, tortured, and killed
some detainees," the State Department report said.]{.underline}

Wednesday's report added that "members of the minority Uygur ethnic
group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment by law
enforcement officers".

The report cited the case of Abdulreshit Seley Hajim, a Uygur
businessman, who died in May or June while held in an internment camp.
According to those interviewed by Radio Free Asia, he died from strikes
to the head with a blunt object, according to the report.

"Survivors stated authorities subjected individuals in custody to
electrocution, waterboarding, beatings, stress positions, injection of
unknown substances, and cold cells."

According to Human Rights Watch, these camps focused on "military-style
discipline and pervasive political indoctrination of the detainees".

Available information was limited, but some reports described the
withholding of food as punishment for those who could not learn Chinese
phrases and songs, the report said.

The report also cited Beijing's violations and abuses of other human
rights including unlawful killings by the government, forced
disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, harsh and life-threatening
prison and detention conditions.

Authorities harassed, detained, and arrested citizens who promoted
independent efforts to combat abuses of power, it said.

In November award-winning Chinese documentary photographer Lu Guang
disappeared after travelling to Xinjiang to lead a photography workshop.

A month later, Lu's wife Xu Xiaoli, who lives in the United States, told
the South China Morning Post that her husband had been arrested by the
police. She wasn't told what Lu was charged with.

#### South Korea is escalating in SCS

America's Indo-Pacific strategy", South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3017509/south-koreas-us-china-dilemma-deepens-support-americas-indo)Q

[South Korea's plan to take part in the United States' Indo-Pacific
strategy has deepened its dilemma as it tries to maintain a balance
between its security ally]{.underline}, the US, and top trading partner,
China, analysts said.

Seoul's intention to get involved in the strategy -- as announced by
South Korean President Moon Jae-in this week in a joint press conference
with US President Donald Trump -- is expected to increase the capacity
of the US and its allies for operations in the disputed South China Sea
\[1\].

Moon's remarks at the presidential Blue House -- the first of their kind
for the South Korean leader elected in 2017 -- had special significance
given that the Indo-Pacific strategy is seen in Beijing as an initiative
to contain China.

Moon said that "under the regional cooperation principles of openness,
inclusiveness and transparency, we have agreed to put forth harmonious
cooperation between Korea's new Southern policy and the United States'
Indo-Pacific strategy".

Seoul's "new Southern policy" was announced in 2017 after Beijing
instituted unofficial sanctions on the nation -- including a boycott of
South Korean tourism -- in response to Seoul's decision to allow the US
to deploy an anti-missile system in the country.

Beijing had protested the US' move, saying it would allow the American
government to look deep into the mainland and monitor China's military
facilities.

[The new South Korean policy was widely viewed as an extension of its
effort to lessen its reliance on a single country -- China -- and
diversify its economic market by building deeper ties with Southeast and
Southwest Asian countries.]{.underline}

South Korean firms had been exiting China to avoid the political and
economic challenges that complicated the countries' relationship amid
the US-China trade war and the American military's deployment of the
anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South
Korea.

[But Seoul had played down its China-exit strategy and until this week
had never explicitly linked it to the US' Indo-Pacific game plan --
possibly involving South Korea's military presence in the South China
Sea.]{.underline}

Seoul has actively responded to Washington's calls to support global
security operations in Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, East Timor,
Afghanistan, Iraq, the Gulf of Aden, Lebanon, South Sudan and the UAE.

But in the South China Sea, it has maintained an ambiguous presence.

Since Seoul needs Beijing's support for its effort to reunite with North
Korea and end the countries' seven-decade estrangement, it has tried to
avoid getting involved in military conflicts that could provoke
Beijing's ire.

But it has faced "tremendous pressure" from Washington, as it strives to
keep up relations with both the US and China, according to multiple
South Korean and US diplomatic sources.

Timothy Heath, senior international defence researcher at Rand
Corporation, a California-based think tank, said Seoul's decision to
throw its support behind the Indo-Pacific strategy may have been
"influenced in part by pressure by the White House for burden sharing".

"With Trump taking steps to ease tensions by meeting with North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un, Washington may have asked Seoul to do more to
support US efforts to promote stability and balance in the region,"
Heath said.

"Seoul may have also calculated that Beijing is in a weak position to
retaliate, due to the ongoing trade war with the US."

Analysts said Seoul's participation in the strategy would significantly
increase the operational capability of the US and its allies in the
region, especially in the South China Sea.

[The US and its allies have been sending military vessels to the South
China Sea to counterbalance China's deployment of troops and weaponry in
the contested waters and blunt its enhancing of radar systems and
building up piers to house navy vessels, among other military
activity.]{.underline}

According to the 2019 Global Firepower Index, a ranking of world
military strength by country, South Korea is the world's seventh
strongest military power after the US, Russia, China, India, France and
Japan.

[The South Korean navy has about 70,000 regular personnel and 150
commissioned ships.]{.underline}

The naval aviation force consists of about 70 fixed-wing and rotary-wing
aircraft, while the marine corps has about 300 tracked vehicles,
including assault amphibious vehicles.

Seoul announced in October a plan to expand its maritime forces into a
"blue-water" navy -- capable of operating globally, across oceans -- to
safeguard its strategic interests amid China's expansion in the South
China Sea.

[The plan would "expand the navy's operational area into far seas, to
secure maritime traffic routes, and ensure the free maritime activities
and the safety of our citizens", the South Korean navy reported to
parliament.]{.underline}

Bruce Bennett, a senior defence researcher at the Rand Corporation, said
it was important to remember that the defence treaty between the US and
South Korea was "a mutual defence treaty -- it is not just about
defending South Korea".

For decades, Bennett said, the US had "provided forces and made
commitments to defend the South against North Korean hostility".

China, he continued, "will not be happy with the South if it defies
China's claims in the South China Sea ... \[But\] it appears that over
time, China wants to establish a position of dominance over its
neighbours, hoping to be able to dictate how its neighbours act".

If the South wished to maintain independence from Chinese control,
Bennett said, "it must be prepared to stand up to Chinese assertions of
dominance.

"Otherwise, at some point China will likely insist that South Korea pay
China for the right to transit the South China Sea and assert other
forms of control."

Zhao Tong, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy,
said South Korea has increasingly got caught in the middle of the
Washington-Beijing power competition.

When South Korea deployed THAAD, Beijing retaliated with its unofficial
sanctions, including halting the Chinese expansion plans of the South
Korean conglomerate Lotte Corporation, he said. China also banned South
Korean TV shows and boycotted South Korean tourism.

Zhao said Seoul's "rhetorical support for the Indo-Pacific strategy"
showed that South Korea can be expected to rely on the US for security
support for the foreseeable future.

"But at the same time, South Korea cannot afford to antagonise China
under whose shadow it has to live," he said. "So far, South Korea has
taken care not to deliberately provoke China in the South China Sea and
it may continue to do so in the future."

After Seoul announced it would support the US Indo-Pacific strategy,
Washington released a statement welcoming the move, further cementing
South Korea's involvement.

The US urged Seoul to engage in "meaningful cooperation" in "maritime"
affairs.

"Both sides reaffirmed that the strong US-ROK alliance is the linchpin
of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific," the US State Department said
on Tuesday.

But experts said South Korea's South China Sea presence was unlikely to
be large in the short term, and its involvement would be mainly
symbolic.

Rand Corporation's Heath said "the US is mainly interested in the
political and symbolic importance of South Korea's support for
international freedoms in the South China Sea".

"Occasional South Korean participation in patrols could help serve that
goal," the defence researcher said.

["South Korea may also carry out diplomatic and political statements and
activities in support of a free and open South China Sea," giving the US
a "symbolic victory", Heath said.]{.underline}

["China may protest diplomatically, but it has a strong incentive to
treat South Korean Navy ships gently.]{.underline}

"Missteps that resulted in a crisis or dangerous situation would only
drive South Korea and Japan closer together and encourage a stronger
US-Japan-ROK cooperation," he said.

#### Tariffs/Trade War causes major tensions

**Lee 5/31**/19 (Don Lee, covers the US and global economy out of
Washington, D.C., has served as the Shanghai bureau chief and in various
editing and reporting roles in California, "For the U.S. and China, it's
not a trade war anymore --- it's something worse", Los Angeles Times,
https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-us-china-trade-stalemate-20190531-story.html)Q

Reporting from Washington --- What started out two years ago as an
effort by President Trump to wring better terms from China on the nuts
and bolts of foreign trade now threatens to become a far wider and more
ominous confrontation.

[The conflict continues to be framed as a "trade war" between the
world's two biggest economies --- as Washington and Beijing pursue an
escalating series of tariff hikes and other retaliatory
measures.]{.underline}

Even as Trump moved Thursday to open a new, potentially damaging trade
war with Mexico, however, the conflict with China has widened beyond the
original trade-based issues.

Beneath the surface, a new tone has begun to emerge since trade talks
broke down in early May and Trump ratcheted up tariffs on imported goods
from China, an action met with retaliatory duties from Beijing.
Officials on both sides of the Pacific have begun to portray the
U.S.-China relationship in nationalistic and emotion-charged terms that
suggest a much deeper conflict.

Recently, for example, a private group of American economists and trade
experts with long-standing experience in China traveled to Beijing,
expecting their usual technical give-and-take with Chinese government
officials.

Instead, a member of the Chinese Politburo harangued them for almost an
hour, describing the U.S.-China relationship as a "clash of
civilizations" and boasting that China's government-controlled system
was far superior to the "Mediterranean culture" of the West, with its
internal divisions and aggressive foreign policy.

On the U.S. side, a senior State Department official, during a forum
last month in Washington, warned of a deepening confrontation with China
that she cast in something close to racial terms.

In the Cold War with the Soviet Union, said Kiron Skinner, the State
Department's director of policy planning, Washington at least faced
fellow Caucasians, whereas with Beijing, Washington faces a nonwhite
culture.

["In China we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological
competitor, one that really does seek a kind of global reach, that many
of us didn't expect a couple of decades ago," Skinner said. "And I think
it's also striking that this is the first time that we will have a
great-power competitor that is not Caucasian."]{.underline}

On the trade issues themselves, the two sides may still be able to reach
a truce, with the best chance coming with the economic summit of major
nations at the end of June in Osaka, Japan. Trump and Chinese President
Xi Jinping are scheduled to attend the meeting of Group of 20 leaders.

Nothing short of a deal struck directly by the two leaders is likely to
avert new rounds of punches and counter-punches over economic and
financial ties, analysts say.

But whether either leader is interested in a stand-down is unclear.

[The conflict, however, now goes beyond just the escalation of tariffs.
Attitudes have hardened in recent days after the Trump administration
blacklisted the telecom firm Huawei, essentially blocking one of China's
most successful global companies from buying crucial components and
software from U.S. firms. (Huawei later got a temporary reprieve on some
of the Commerce Department restrictions.)]{.underline}

[The White House is preparing similar actions against other Chinese
high-tech firms, according to news reports.]{.underline}

"All of that would sap most of the remaining interest the Chinese have
in negotiating with the Trump administration on trade," said Scott
Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. China, he added, will probably "hunker down and try to get by
until either the second term of the Trump administration or the incoming
new administration."

On Sunday, China's State Council issued an 8,300-word white paper
blaming the U.S. government for escalating the trade war but expressing
a desire for continued talks.

Addressing a rare news conference, Vice Minister of Commerce Wang
Shouwen said that the goal of trade negotiations should be the
cancellation of tariffs by both sides, but that talks must proceed on
the basis of equality.

The U.S. should take "full responsibility" for instigating and
accelerating the trade war, said Guo Weimin, vice minister of the State
Council Information Office. "China doesn't want to fight, is not afraid
of fighting, but will fight if it has no choice," Guo said.

The widening friction has not yet had a big impact on financial markets
or the broader economy. But the domestic politics, for now, seem to
favor conflict, not compromise.

At home Trump mostly gets cheers for going after an adversary many
Americans believe is an unfair trading partner that has stolen valuable
U.S. intellectual property in its rise to superpower status. The
political risk for Trump from potential Democratic opponents in 2020
isn't from hitting China too hard, but treading too softly or coming
away with a weak deal.

In China, the party's propaganda organ has dusted off old patriotic
films of the Korean War --- when the Chinese army pushed back American
forces advancing northward --- and Xi's recent countryside tour conveyed
a message of girding up for a new "Long March" to resist a foreign
bully.

At this point, many experts on U.S.-China relations say, the best one
might hope for is a temporary truce, and even that will be hard to come
by if Trump keeps piling on the pressure.

By the time the G-20 summit starts on June 28, the U.S. trade
representative will have wrapped up public hearings on a proposed new
tranche of tariffs, meaning it could at any time impose taxes on the
remaining \$300 billion of imports from China, [including many ordinary
consumer goods. Earlier rounds have imposed hefty 25% duties on about
\$250 billion of Chinese products.]{.underline}

[China's retaliatory tariffs, at first dollar for dollar, have been more
limited in recent rounds, for the simple reason that its imports of
American merchandise, about \$120 billion last year, are less than
one-fourth of what it sends to the United States. China has added
tariffs on about \$110 billion of U.S. products.]{.underline}

Beijing could hit back in other ways, however. Already 1 in 5 U.S. firms
operating in China say they face increased inspections and slower
customs clearances, according to a recent survey by the American
Chambers of Commerce in Shanghai and Beijing.

China has reportedly suspended purchases of billions of dollars of U.S.
soybeans, and officials have begun to signal they could restrict
supplies of so-called rare-earth elements that are important for
manufacturing electric cars and other high-tech products.

China is the world's dominant producer of rare earths.

Beijing also could spur boycotts of popular American products such as
Apple iPhones or curtail tourism to the United States, which would be
particularly painful for states such as California. And American
universities already are fretting about a potential drop-off in
full-tuition-paying Chinese students.

Then there's Boeing, the single biggest American exporter to China.
Sales to China last year accounted for more than 20% of the company's
commercial aircraft revenue.

Boeing has been embattled in recent weeks by the grounding of its 737
Max fleet after two fatal crashes. The company faces several
governmental investigations related to the jet as it is working with
federal authorities on software fixes in the hopes of resuming service
soon.

Beijing could withhold its own certificate of airworthiness, which would
keep the 737 Max from flying in and through China, with almost certain
spillover effects to other countries.

"It strikes me as a logical sort of retaliation ... and obvious where
China has at least potential for some leverage with what's going on with
Huawei," said David Bachman, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the
University of Washington in Seattle.

If no progress takes place on trade at the G-20 summit and a new round
of tariffs and counter-tariffs takes effect, the next escalation could
come in mid-August. That's when the Commerce Department's 90-day
reprieve for Huawei runs out and the Chinese start to find out how long
and well Huawei can manage without key Android software updates from
Google, as well as crucial chips and other hardware from American
suppliers.

For those and other reasons, including rising risks to financial markets
and potentially shifting political calculus, Damien Ma, a fellow at the
Paulson Institute think tank in Chicago, still sees the possibility of a
limited trade deal by fall. But even then, Ma said, there'll be no
agreement unless the two presidents get personally involved and talk
with each other.

["At the end of the day, they'll need to reset the tone a little bit and
try to manage a deescalation" of the trade war, he said.]{.underline}

### 1nc -- at -- china invasion

#### No Chinese invasion 

**Pinto 2/5**/19 (Diane Pinto, Public Policy Coordinator at SIIA, "No,
China Isn't Going to Invade Taiwan Any Time Soon", Georgetown Security
Studies Review,
<http://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/02/05/no-china-isnt-going-to-invade-taiwan-any-time-soon/>)

A few weeks ago, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) released a
report titled, China's Military Power.\[i\] [The report gives an
overview of the communist People's Republic of China's (PRC) current
military power, changing threat perceptions, and describes the potential
for armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait through aggressive action by the
PRC.]{.underline} The DIA report brought to light many of the PRC's
military developments, and raised concerns\[ii\] of a renewed threat
that the PRC is planning to conduct an invasion of the island of Taiwan,
controlled by the Republic of China (ROC), in the near future.\[iii\]
Controlling Taiwan has long had important geopolitical value to the PRC.
It would officially end the civil conflict between the Communist Party
of China and the ROC's Kuomintang nationalists that dates back several
decades. It would also enable the PRC to, per the UN Convention of the
Law of the Sea,\[iv\] legitimize its claim to waters surrounding Taiwan
as an Exclusive Economic Zone, strengthening its position in territorial
disputes in the South and East China Seas.\[v\] [However, even [though
the reclamation of Taiwan]{.mark} is one of the PRC's top
priorities,]{.underline} [it [is unlikel]{.mark}y that it will attempt
to do so in the near future, [due to geopolitical, operational, and
economic reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

First and foremost, any analysis of a PRC-ROC conflict scenario would be
remiss without mentioning the role of the United States if the PRC
attempted to invade Taiwan. Historically, each time the PRC was
provocative towards Taiwan, the U.S. intervened in some way to deter
further aggression.\[vi\] Though the U.S. scrapped its mutual defense
treaty with the ROC when it recognized the PRC as the official governing
body of China[, [the Taiwan Relations Act]{.underline}]{.mark} [of 1979
(TRA) still [provides for a strategic partnership between the U.S. and
the ROC]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\[]{.mark}vii\] [Since the implementation
of the TRA, the U.S. has expressed its support through considerable arms
sales to the ROC]{.underline}, much to the chagrin of the PRC.\[viii\]
Therefore, it can be assumed that both due to the TRA and due to U.S.
strategic interests in the region that any attack on Taiwan would be met
with swift repercussions from the U.S. which maintains a sizeable
presence in the area. [An attack could then, [in turn, involve U.S.
regional partners]{.mark} like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and
others who would likely take actions either through military or economic
means [in response to PRC attempts to expand its
control]{.mark}.]{.underline} For these reasons, as long as the U.S.
continues to maintain its support and a presence in the region, risking
engagement in a conflict among great powers would be a poor calculation
for the PRC in the near future.

Operationally, the PRC's military[, [the People's Liberation
Army]{.underline}]{.mark} [(PLA) still has several challenges to
overcome before being capable of invading Taiwan]{.underline}. Outside
of the Korean War (referred to as the People's Volunteer Army), Vietnam
War, and subsequent Sino-Vietnam conflict, the PLA's only practical
[combat experience has been limited to low-intensity
conflicts]{.underline}. These engagements were mainly ground operations.
Invading an island, like Taiwan, would require the PLA to coordinate
joint operations among some or all of its services, something it is
still in the process of both figuring out how to do effectively and also
developing the appropriate technical capabilities to do so.\[ix\] [Since
about 70 percent of the PLA is composed of the PLA Army,\[x\] [it does
not at this time]{.mark} have sufficient naval, air, or amphibious
operational capability or know-how to utilize one or two services in
lieu of [a fully joint force in a large island
invasion]{.mark}.\[xi\]]{.underline}

Though the DIA report recognizes measures taken by past PRC presidents
and current President Xi Jinping to improve the PLA's organization and
joint capabilities, the PLA still has a long way to go. It continues to
undergo a massive reorganization that President Xi implemented in
2015.\[xii\] Also, it has not had the opportunity to test its joint
readiness against a real opponent. Even testing its joint operability
against either a less capable state or engaging a rival on a smaller
scale would not likely go uncontested. [Virtually [any aggressive
acts]{.mark} [from the PRC]{.mark} against its neighbors would likely be
met with a coalition force in opposition, and it [would have almost no
allies in support]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Finally, the ROC's economic situation makes it unlikely for the PRC to
attempt to invade Taiwan.]{.underline} The ROC's liberalized and
well-performing economy enables it to be taken seriously on the global
stage. It acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001 and is a
member of a variety of other international trade organizations and
bilateral trade agreements. Even the PRC has increased its trade
relations with the ROC and economic cooperation.\[[xiii\] [Because the
ROC is a significant]{.mark} enough [contributor to the global
economy]{.mark} and the PRC and ROC are increasingly intertwined, [an
invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan [would probably cause significant economic
downturn]{.mark} not just for both the PRC and ROC, but also [for the
region if not the world.\[]{.mark}xiv\]]{.underline}

In sum, concerns surrounding a PRC invasion of Taiwan in the near-term
future are fairly overblown. [Even though the reclamation of Taiwan is
one of the top priorities of the PRC, it is unlikely that it will occur
in the next few years. Each time there was a crisis in the Taiwan
Strait, the crisis ended due to U.S. support and the unwillingness of
the PRC to escalate force.]{.underline} As long as the U.S. continues to
find ways to support Taiwan and maintain a military presence in the
South and East China Seas, this threat potential is significantly
diminished. These elements are compounded with the lack of operational
capability by the PRC to conduct an invasion and the adverse economic
effects such an invasion would have on the global economy, showing that
the best-case scenario for the PRC in the short-term future is to
refrain from invading Taiwan.

### 2nc -- at -- china invasion

#### Not happening now despite build up -- next decade

**Stowell '18** (Joshua Stowell, Editor of Global Security Review, MA
from the School of International Relations at the University of
St.Andrews and is a member of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, "Expect Rising Tensions Between China and Taiwan for the
Foreseeable Future", Global Security Review, 8/15/18,

[Beijing could attempt to reunify China by force within the next
decade.]{.underline}

The issue of reunification between mainland China and the island of
Taiwan is one of the most significant obstacles to Chinese President Xi
Jinping's drive for "national rejuvenation," a campaign to restore
China's position as a global power by 2049.

Since the end of the Chinese Civil War, Taiwan has been de facto
independent, and Beijing has not made forcible attempts to recapture
what the Chinese Communist Party considers a wayward province. However,
China has made attempts to lure Taiwan closer while preventing it from
formally declaring independence.

[The Taiwanese independence movement has steadily grown in influence
over the past few decades, while the United States has signaled its
willingness to provide a greater degree of support]{.underline} for the
democratically-ruled island, factors which have contributed to the
highest cross-straight tensions in over ten years. [The Trump
Administration will likely lay the groundwork for a closer relationship
with Taiwan as it ratchets up pressure on China.]{.underline}

[The Chinese government has shifted between threatening of military
force to economic incentives in its campaign to draw Taiwan into
Beijing's sphere of influence. Throughout 2017 and 2018, the growing
military strength of mainland China alongside its aggressive
reunification rhetoric and coercive diplomacy has led the U.S. to
increase arms sales to Taiwan, increase official-level communications
between Taipei and Washington, and improve U.S.-Taiwan defense
cooperation.]{.underline}

Strengthened Taiwan-U.S. Ties

[The growing cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwan has, in turn,
aggravated tensions between the U.S. and China]{.underline}, as the
latter regards the former as challenging the "One China" principle that
states that mainland China holds sovereignty over the island of Taiwan.
While the Trump Administration is by no means the first to draw China's
ire in this arena, strengthened ties between the U.S. and Taiwan are
accompanied by a shifting geopolitical landscape in the Indo-Pacific.

China's rising economic, political, and military power has greatly
changed the Indo-Pacific balance of power. [China is more willing to use
force to achieve its aims---one of which is reuniting Taiwan with the
mainland. Reunification would be of both symbolic and strategic
significance---Xi Jinping has declared reunification a key facet of his
"national rejuvenation" by 2049 initiative, and establishing control
over Taiwan would allow China to project power unimpeded into the
Pacific.]{.underline}

Taiwan's location, and de facto independence, currently present an
impediment to Beijing's global ambitions. Furthermore, China sees the
island as a potential national security threat, as an independent Taiwan
could be utilized by the U.S. as a jumping-off point for sorties against
mainland China in any U.S.-China conflict.

Growing Urgency in China

Reunification is an increasingly urgent issue for Beijing---which has
historically employed patience---due to Xi Jinping's self-imposed
deadline for reunification by 2049. Simultaneously, perceived growing
U.S. support for an independent Taiwan, and the failure of the
mainland's previous efforts at reunification through economic incentives
is raising the pressure on China.

[Increased U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation would likely be met with
condemnation by Beijing, however, it may be the most effective means of
deterring a mainland invasion of the island. Increased cooperation
between the U.S. and Taiwan could take the form of the U.S. taking a
visible and active presence on the island.]{.underline} This would
ensure that China would find itself at war with the U.S. in the event of
any attempt at reunification by force.

[Regardless, it's unlikely that China will attempt to reunify the
mainland with Taiwan within the next decade. Taiwan maintains a strong
conventional military, and the risk of a U.S. intervention remains high.
However, China is steadily increasing its hard power capabilities and is
projected to have a military capable of true power projection on a
global scale by 2030. For the foreseeable future, reunifying China will
remain a key strategic objective of Beijing.]{.underline}

#### Home field advantage and American assistance -- deters any possible Chinese attack

**Sands '18** (Gary Sands, Senior Analyst at Wikistrat, a crowdsourced
consultancy, and a Director at Highway West Capital Advisors, a venture
capital, project finance and political risk advisory. A former diplomat
with the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, he has
contributed a number of op-eds for Forbes, U.S. News and World Report,

Taiwan Won\'t Be Easy", National Interest, 5/3/18,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-chinese-invasion-taiwan-wont-be-easy-25682)Q>

If an invasion of Taiwan were attempted today, it would probably turn
into a debacle.

A recent poll revealed nearly two-thirds of Taiwanese believe their
military is not capable of preventing an invasion by China\'s armed
forces. Only 27 percent of those polled were confident Taiwan forces
could deter an invasion. The poll was conducted by the Taiwanese Public
Opinion Foundation just days before a live-fire military exercise was
held by China in the Taiwan Strait on April 18.

[Despite a lack of confidence in their military, nearly 70 percent of
Taiwanese would either join the army or put up resistance should China
launch an attack]{.underline}, according to another survey conducted by
the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. A lesser number (55 percent) would
fight if war was instigated by a declaration of independence from
Taipei.

[Home field advantage]{.underline}

A local population fighting for the survival of its values and lifestyle
is not to be taken lightly, as made clear by Ian Easton. In his 2017
book, The Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwan\'s Defense and American
Strategy in Asia, Easton believes the cohesive spirit of [2.5 million
registered men of military age, fighting on difficult yet familiar
terrain, gives Taiwan the advantage]{.underline}. Moreover, Easton
contradicts the views of those Taiwanese recently polled who believe
their military is not up to the task of defending the nation, arguing
"There are few nations on the planet more resilient and ready for an
enemy first strike than Taiwan." He points to [Taiwanese fighter
jets]{.underline}, which could [inflict a loss ratio of two or three to
one against inferior Chinese pilots]{.underline}, and the possibility
Taiwan's military could force the Chinese to de-escalate without
American military support.

[U.S. military assistance]{.underline}

The poll also asked Taiwanese their views on whether or not the United
States would send troops to help defend Taiwan. While 47.4 percent of
Taiwanese were confident of support, some 41 percent of those polled
expressed doubts America would come to the rescue.

The high turnover within the Trump administration, along with the U.S.
President's still evolving foreign policy stances (e.g. Taiwan's flag
was deleted on off all government websites in January), may have played
into the doubts of those Taiwanese polled. And for those familiar with
the history and language of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (TRA), its
origins and ambiguous wording may have added to their doubt.

Prior to 1979, Taiwanese could rely on the protection of the
Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, enacted after Chinese mainland
forces began shelling Kinmen and Matsu in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis
of 1954. The treaty was in effect until 1979, when U.S. President Jimmy
Carter formally recognized the communist People's Republic of China
(PRC) and severed official relations with Taiwan.

With the loss of a formal defense treaty, the TRA was a unique effort by
Congress to limit the damage to U.S.-Taiwan relations by President
Carter, and reassure Taipei of continued relations and U.S. military
assistance. A domestic law passed by Congress, [the TRA made it the
policy of the United States "to maintain the capacity of the United
States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that
would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the
people on Taiwan."]{.underline}

While the Act [calls for the United States to be prepared to deter an
invasion]{.underline}, it leaves the question of whether or not to
respond, and how to respond, to the President and Congress, who "shall
determine, in accordance with constitutional processes[, appropriate
action by the United States in response to any such
danger]{.underline}." In this respect, however, the language of the Act
is similar to that found in many U.S. mutual defense treaties, and
leaves any decision to respond militarily more dependent on political
will than law.

The threat of invasion

While the Taiwanese may not be confident of their military's ability to
fend off such an attack, or are skeptical over U.S. military support,
many are not losing sleep over fear of an invasion. Some 64.5 percent do
not believe China\'s military will invade Taiwan, while only 25.7
percent think an attack is likely.

The poll did not ask Taiwanese why they thought an attack may or may not
occur, or provide varying time frames for an invasion, so we can only
speculate as to their reasoning. One possible reason is those polled
concur with Easton's view that Beijing is ready yet---despite China's
much-heralded military prowess and the threat it brings. Easton calls
China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is a "dangerous fighting force,"
though adding it "is not a finely honed instrument of war." [According
to Easton, "if the invasion was attempted today, it would probably turn
into a debacle" adding further, "no invasion of Taiwan is going to be
seriously contemplated as a viable option for many years to
come."]{.underline}

So despite recent heated rhetoric from Beijing and live-fire drills in
the Taiwan Strait, it would appear from the polling that Taiwanese are
taking the threats in stride, and will continue to carry on their daily
lives without too much worry.

#### China won't take over -- economic ties and US defense

- \+ solvency for more arm sales cp

**Pomfret '18** (John Pomfret, former Washington Post bureau chief in
Beijing, "Can China really take over Taiwan?", The Washington Post,
1/5/18,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/01/05/can-china-really-take-over-taiwan/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cd0960bbb073)Q

Chinese air force fighters have begun escorting bombers around Taiwan in
"encirclement drills" and spokesmen for the Communist government have
warned Taiwan to get used to it . On Wednesday, China's president Xi
Jinping, dressed in military fatigues, convened a military mobilization
meeting--- the first ever for the entire Chinese armed forces and
commanded China's military to become "battle ready." Chinese officials
are threatening that relations with Taiwan will turn "grave" because
Taiwan's government refuses to acknowledge that the island is part of
China. A leading Chinese analyst predicts that China has accelerated its
timetable to 2020 for taking over the island by military means.

Meanwhile, the [Trump administration has vowed to strengthen the United
States' relations with Taiwan and has floated the idea of U.S. naval
visits to the islands]{.underline}, prompting Li Kexin, a minister at
the Chinese Embassy in Washington, to threaten that "the day a U.S. navy
vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People's Liberation Army
(PLA) unifies Taiwan with military force."

[The ratcheting up of tension across the Taiwan Strait is a reminder
that the island democracy]{.underline}, which Beijing claims is a
province of China, remains a center of gravity in East Asia. But it also
raises a question: can China really take over Taiwan?

For years, most analysts in the United States generally accepted the
idea that Taiwan's status as a de facto independent democracy was
unsustainable as China's economy and military rose to dominate Asia.
Statesmen such as the late Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew and Henry
Kissinger both predicted that Taiwan's unification with China --- under
Chinese terms --- was inevitable. Hastening this trend was the sense
among many senior U.S. officials that Taiwan was more a roadblock to
Washington's smooth relations with Communist China than an asset in
their ideological competition with an authoritarian Beijing. One senior
U.S. naval officer even referred to the island as "the turd in the
punchbowl," befouling closer ties with China.

However, in recent years, U.S. analysts and officials, bucking the view
that China's rise will never end, have begun to question the assumption
that China is going to absorb the island. Two recent scholarly articles
are indicative of this new trend. Both Denny Roy , a senior fellow at
the East-West Center in Honolulu, and Michael Beckley, a professor of
political science at Tufts University, doubt whether China has the
capacity and even the will to take over Taiwan.

When it comes to wooing Taiwan, [both scholars note that Chinese policy
has failed]{.underline}. [Beijing's contradictory mix of
threats]{.underline}, such as [deploying hundreds of missiles directly
opposite the island]{.underline} on mainland China and jailing Taiwanese
human rights campaigners who visit China, and blandishments, such as
encouraging Chinese tourism to the island, have only [hardened Taiwan's
opposition to unification]{.underline}. A poll last year revealed that
three quarters of people in Taiwan think that the island and China are
two separate countries, with only 14 percent believing that they are
parts of one nation. That's a significant change from two decades ago
when more than half of Taiwan's population said they considered
themselves Chinese. In elections in January 2016, the Democratic
Progressive Party, which favors independence from China, won its
first-ever majority in Taiwan's legislature. The party's candidate, Tsai
Ing-wen, won the presidency as well.

If making nice with Taiwan has failed, could China use its economic
leverage to bring the island to heal? China is Taiwan's largest trading
partner and China is Taiwan's main destination for outbound investment;
[40 percent of Taiwan's exports flow to China and a fifth of Taiwan's
gross domestic product derives from its economic ties to the
mainland]{.underline}. But Roy and Beckley both believe that [Beijing
would have a hard time translating these ties into hard
power]{.underline}. If China seized Taiwan's investments, Roy noted, [it
would surely be painful for Taiwan. But it would probably backfire and
cause more resentment]{.underline}.

If China went a step further and blockaded Taiwan, that would constitute
an act of war. And when it comes to war both scholars question China's
ability to see it through. First, [the risks of failure are
extraordinarily high]{.underline}. Roy notes that [military measures
against Taiwan would hurt China's economy]{.underline} and its standing
in Asia, justifying fears that China was intent on bullying its
neighbors. In addition, [while China possibly could win the war, Roy
thinks it could also lose the peace]{.underline}. [China only needs to
look at what faced the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq to see what
an occupying force might deal with]{.underline} in Taiwan. Sure, there
are those who argue that no one in Taiwan is willing to fight. Taiwan's
young have been branded "caomeizu" or the strawberry generation, pretty
to look at but easily bruised. But that ignores their political
activism. They spearheaded the 2014 Sunflower Movement that opposed
closer economic ties with China.

In his article, Beckley bores down on the details of a Chinese attack.
[His conclusion is that neither a blockade, nor an invasion, nor a
strategic bombing campaign has much hope for success]{.underline}.
Beckley notes that in 200 years of warfare no blockade has coerced a
country into surrendering its sovereignty. In the 1940s, Operation
Starvation, the U.S. blockade of Japan, cut imports by 97 percent and
still it took two atomic weapons to end the war. As for strategic
bombing, Beckley reports that none of 14 previous campaigns succeeded in
decisively affecting the outcome of a war.

[As for an invasion, he is similarly pessimistic about China's
chances.]{.underline} By his calculation, China's ability to put boots
on Taiwan's ground is limited to about 26,000 troops on the first day of
battle and 15,000 a day after that, assuming China's soldiers survive
the eight-hour trip across the 100-mile wide Taiwan Strait. That's a big
assumption given that Taiwan has an advanced early warning system, along
with coastal artillery, state-of-the-art mines and anti-ship missile
batteries. Taiwan also has the capacity to rapidly move its force of
150,000 and only 10 percent of Taiwan's shoreline is suitable for
amphibious landings. [Should the United States get involved in defending
Taiwan, Beckley cites a study that predicts that 8 U.S. submarines could
sink 40 percent of the PLA's amphibious invasion force while losing
perhaps one submarine.]{.underline}

Clearly, China's military modernization is progressing. It is estimated
that currently China devotes one-third of its military budget to
preparing for a war to take Taiwan. To that end, both Roy and Beckley
argue that it is incumbent on the governments of the United States and
Taiwan to continue to work together to ensure Taiwan's security.

[Taiwan needs to increase its defense spending
considerably.]{.underline} In July, President Tsai Ing-wen said the
budget could increase by as much as 3 percent a year , but that's not
enough. [Trump administration officials have told me that the United
States wants Taiwan to double its defense expenditures
soon.]{.underline}

[The Trump administration also needs to continue efforts to bolster
Taiwan's defenses.]{.underline} The administration's National Security
Strategy, issued in December, commits the United States to maintaining
"our strong ties with Taiwan." U.S. Marines will now guard the American
Institute in Taiwan, the mission there, making it more like a typical
embassy. For the first time, legislators from Taiwan were welcomed as a
group to the State Department in February. [And in June, the Trump
administration announced a \$1.4 billion arms package for
Taiwan.]{.underline} But a lot more can be done. As Roy concludes, "the
outcome of the game \[between China and Taiwan\] is undecided."

(CCP) has established Socialism with Chinese characteristics, or, less
euphemistically, state capitalism, that necessitates state powers using
markets to create wealth, while ensuring political survival of the
ruling class]{.underline}**.** As a government that now presides over
the second largest (soon to be the largest) economy in the world [---
and one that depends intimately on flows of international goods and
capital --- the CCP no longer simply practices state capitalism at home:
it applies it globally.]{.underline} Although the West has long played
mercantilist games, it has gradually migrated toward the belief that
liberalization of international markets is mutually beneficial for all
countries. But [China continues to see international economics as a zero
sum game]{.underline}. It finds its developing status a convenient cloak
and justification for the application of global state capitalism. [It
engages in beggar-thy-neighbor policies it deems advantageous, and
distorts the world's markets according to the dictates of its political
demands, while dismissing criticism of such behavior as unfair to a
developing country.]{.underline} Similarly, on political issues**, China
portrays naked self interest as the reasonable demands of a developing
country, and displays this behavior in nearly every arena in which it
interacts with the world, from foreign aid and investment to
multilateral institutions to international relations. The deliberate
undervaluation of the yuan in the last decade pointed to further
distortions of international markets by China's state capitalism. The
Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that the yuan
was undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent, amounting to a massive
export subsidy. However, the yuan's undervaluation was just the tip of
the iceberg. As importantly, Chinese banks receive a hidden subsidy: a
wide spread between the rates paid on household deposits and the rates
banks charge for loans. Bankers, who are in effect state employees ---
given that the banking system is largely government run --- funnel the
artificially cheap money to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Since
households have no investment alternative to domestic banks, they in
effect provide a huge subsidy to Chinese industry. The CCP's state
capitalism mandates growth and employment through exports and investment
at all costs in order to ensure its political supremacy. Even as China
increases its economic presence through investment and greater influence
in multilateral institutions, it continues to reap benefits intended to
accrue to the world's truly needy nations. By all rights, China should
be a donor nation in multilateral development banks, not a recipient of
aid. That China is the Asian Development Bank's largest recipient of
Bank funds really is scandalous, and comes at the cost of countries like
Bangladesh and Nepal, the poorest of the poor, which truly need the
resources. As of 2007, China was ranked in the top 15 of development aid
recipients worldwide. By 2010, China had increased its number of voting
shares in the World Bank to become the third-largest stakeholder, behind
the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. and Japan do not receive development
assistance from organizations like the World Bank - at what point does
China's absolute strength count for more than its per capita
development? And why should donor countries like the U.S. and Japan
allow this double standard to occur? Politically, China is an
irredentist power that arguably has done more to advance global nuclear
proliferation than any other state save Pakistan, while routinely doing
business with some of the world's worst governments. Apart from the
issues of Taiwan and the Spratly Islands, China lays claim to much of
India's state of Arunachal Pradesh, and caused major jitters in 2009
with incursions into the territory combined with strident rhetoric.** It
has blocked Asian Development Bank projects approved for India over the
issue. It helped Pakistan develop its nuclear arsenal and ballistic
missile technology**.** [The largest recipients of Chinese military aid
have in the past been India's neighbors, including Myanmar, Pakistan,
Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka in addition to Pakistan; India fears
that]{.underline} [China is engaged in a concerted campaign to undermine
and contain it. In addition, China continues developing its "string of
pearls" strategy in the Indian Ocean, investing significant resources to
develop deep water ports in the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the Seychelles.]{.underline} These appear to be
a basis for the projection of a powerful naval presence into what India
considers its backyard. Meanwhile, China blocks action against or
actively supports a rogue's gallery of nations, among them Iran, North
Korea, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. It claims it has no influence over their
actions, based on its policy of non-interference, but China's support
clearly requires a quid pro quo, be it natural resource wealth, business
ties, or a geopolitically strategic use. [China has avoided sanctions
from the international community, partly due to the image it has
cultivated of itself as a non-interfering developing
country.]{.underline} While the West has also projected its power and
dealt with equally noxious states, domestic political constraints make
such "deals with the devil" increasingly difficult to sell to
electorates attuned to human rights, ethics, and governance, and who are
provided with the freedom of speech to object to their governments'
actions. No such freedom exists in China[. As long as the CCP continues
to govern, China will not change. It will continue to comport itself
according to its zero-sum vision of the world. At best, the West can
hope the CCP's interests converge toward those of the larger globalized
world.]{.underline} Even as China speaks of a peaceful rise within the
existing international structure, its behavior, which at times may be
described as impertinent, belies the West's desire to have faith in its
words. Indeed, many nations around the world appear to be running out of
patience at China's uncompromising approach to the promotion of its own
self-interest. President Obama has attempted to engage China on a
variety of global issues, and for the most part found that his proffered
hand was met with a clenched fist. With either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton
in the White House starting in January, the U.S. is likely to soon
discard the illusion that China is gradually transitioning to become a
responsible global power.

The use of military force by the PLA in East Asian waters is unlikely to
pose an existential threat of the same magnitude. Washington can instead
rely on its not insignificant conventional forces in a limited war at
sea against China in East Asia. It has not developed any strategy akin
to "massive retaliation" to deter China and the PLA. U.S. military
superiority in the maritime domain and the stopping power of water
prevent China from launching an all-out conventional attack on U.S.
forces. [Although China might use nuclear weapons if invaded and Beijing
occupied, it is much less likely, almost inconceivable, that Chinese
leaders would risk a nuclear war with the United States because some of
its naval ships had been sunk. Similarly, it is not likely that the
United States would use nuclear weapons in a confrontation with China.
Even should it lose multiple ships, it could remain confident that the
Chinese navy could not control East Asian waters and become a regional
hegemon within the next decade. In contrast, if the Soviet Red Army
attacked and destroyed U.S. forces in Western Europe, the United States
was much less confident in its ability to prevent the Soviet Union from
gaining the throne as regional hegemon in Europe.]{.underline}

[Until recently, many dismissed the view that the United States and
China could go to war as outlandish.]{.underline} Many people pointed to
the fact that the two countries maintain robust economic ties. Others
contended that China would never be powerful enough to truly challenge
America's primacy. Still others argued that a great power war is simply
unimaginable in the modern era of globalization.

I never subscribed to this view point.

While not completely without merit, the arguments put forward to dismiss
the possibility of a war are not overly persuasive. For instance, while
it is true that China and the United States have a strong economic
relationship, Germany and Britain were each other\'s largest trading
partners before World War I. Similarly, even if China grows old before
it grows rich, that doesn't mean it can't challenge America militarily.
In the run-up to both world wars, Germany was poorer than Great Britain
(and roughly equal to France) yet it nearly conquered Europe on two
separate occasions. This was in large part because Germany had a larger
population than Britain and France, which translated into a larger
economy. China has a population four times the size of the United States
today, meaning its GDP can be twice the size of America's even if it's
citizens are half as rich. And the idea that the human race has outgrown
great power war was famously in vogue in the years prior to World War I
for nearly identical reasons as one hears today.

In recent years, many observers have woken up to the fact that a war
between the United States and China is not unthinkable. Although this is
true, there are still strong pacifying forces. Two factors strike me as
the most important.

[The first, and most obvious one, is that both sides maintain secure
nuclear arsenals]{.underline}. As Thomas Schelling and others have
pointed out, [nuclear weapons are not a game-changer simply because of
their massive destructive capabilities]{.underline}. The speed and
certainty of nuclear retaliation is just as important. These two
characteristics simply aren't present with conventional weapons. Leaders
can delude themselves into thinking their conventional forces, however
improbably, will end up victorious in battle. In any case, the
consequences of being wrong are far in the future.

For instance, Imperial Japanese leaders knew it was a tremendous gamble
to take on the United States. Isoroku Yamamoto, the Japanese admiral who
planned Pearl Harbor, warned his civilian leadership beforehand: "In the
first six to twelve months of a war with the United States and Great
Britain I will run wild and win victory upon victory. But then, if the
war continues after that, I have no expectation of success." After the
American economic embargo, however, Japanese leaders were only faced
with bad options: capitulating in the face of American pressure or
fighting a more powerful enemy in a likely futile effort. In these
circumstances, Tokyo decided to gamble. After all, it was conceivable
that America would be so exhausted from fighting Nazi Germany in Europe
that it would ultimately sue for peace in Asia, especially in the face
of fierce Japanese resistance.

[While the outcome of conventional wars hinges on a number of unknowable
factors, nuclear retaliation is certain.]{.underline} And, unlike with
conventional weapons---especially before airplanes and missiles---one
doesn't have to defeat the other side's military to wreak havoc on its
cities. Nuclear weapons can do so immediately. Moreover, as Robert
Jervis points out, when two countries with secure, thermonuclear
arsenals go to war[, "the side that is 'losing' the war as judged by
various measures of military capability can inflict as much destruction
on the side that is 'winning' as the 'winner' can on the 'loser.'" This
changes the calculation of leaders, and makes it inconceivable that
rational leaders would opt for total war. This is not foolproof of
course--- there is still the possibility that miscalculations, gradual
escalation, or the "threats that leave something to chance" will produce
an outcome neither side wanted--- but it is a strong incentive for
peace.]{.underline}

While it is widely recognized that nuclear weapons make a U.S.-China
conflict less likely, the pacifying effect of geography is often
overlooked. [Geography works to attenuate tensions in two interrelated
ways. First, both China and the United States are massive countries that
would be extremely difficult to conquer and occupy. Second, both are
separated by the largest ocean on earth, and it is extremely difficult
to project power over large bodies of water.]{.underline} As John
Mearsheimer has written: "When great powers are separated by large
bodies of water, [they usually do not have much offensive capability
against each other, regardless of the relative size of their
armies]{.underline}. Large bodies of water are formidable obstacles that
cause significant power-projection problems for attacking armies."

These two geographical factors reduce the intensity of the so-called
security dilemma. [Despite all their disputes over issues like Taiwan
and the East and South China Seas, China and the United States generally
do not have to fear that the other side will seek to invade and conquer
them. This has usually not been the case for rising and ruling powers
that went to war. In many of these instances, the rivals were located on
the same continent or even shared a border, which generated significant
insecurity and led to conflict.]{.underline} As Mearsheimer again
explains, "Great powers located on the same landmass are in a much
better position to attack and conquer each other. That is especially
true of states that share a common border. Therefore, great powers
separated by water are likely to fear each other less than great powers
that can get at each other over land."

Just like nuclear weapons, these geographical factors are not an
absolute guarantee against conflict. Japan and the United States went to
war despite being separated by the Pacific Ocean, and so did Spain and
the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Still, China and
America's large land size and separation are both conducive to peace,
and---combined with nuclear weapons---provide hope that they can avoid
conflict.

The nature of the strategic triangle among Taiwan, the United States,
and China has changed dramatically during the course of the postwar era
from a strong alliance between Washington and Taipei against Beijing
during the 1950s and 1960s to a much more complex situation since then
in which the United States has sought to have fairly good relations with
both the ROC and PRC with the overall nature of the triangle being
generally determined by the degree of hostility between Taipei and
Beijing. One constant, however, has been the much weaker power position
of Taiwan vis-à-vis the other two nations. This has made Taiwan
justifiably cautious in dealing with China and, during periods of
tension between Taipei and Beijing, made American support for the ROC
very important. Figure 2 summarizes the different eras that have
occurred in this strategic triangle. For over 20 years after the
Republic of China re-established itself on Taiwan following Chiang
Kai-shek\'s defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Taiwan and the
United States had a strong alliance (stable marriage) cen- tered on
their Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954, reflecting the Manichean di- vide
of the Cold War. This alliance appeared quite stable, but the changing
dynamics in the Great Power triangle of the US, USSR, and PRC challenged
Taiwan\'s cozy relationship with America in the 1970s. The hostility
between China and the Soviet Union led President Richard Nixon and his
National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to see an advantage in a
rapproachment with the PRC that would allow the US to become the pivot
in the superpower strategic triangle. This led to the intricate
diplomatic dance that culminated in Nixon\'s dramatic visit to Beijing
and the signing of the Shanghai Commu- niqué in February 1972.

This radically switched the nature of the Washington-Taipei-Beijing
strate- gic triangle. Instead of an ROC-US alliance (marriage) against
the PRC, America now became the pivot in a romantic triangle as it
sought to have good relations with both Taiwan and China. Instead of
trying to use its un- doubted leverage to extract concessions from the
two sides, though, [America\'s primary objective appeared to be
maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area. The primary
component of this policy was the continued deterrence of Chinese
threats, especially military ones to Taiwan.]{.underline}

However, as summarized in Figure 3, the nature of the US\'s deterrence
pol- icy shifted fundamentally from what it had been for the preceding
two de- cades. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States used
conventional military deterrence against threats from its enemy China to
its friend Taiwan based on the US-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954[.
The rapprochement with China created a more indirect \"diplomatic
deterrence\" in which China\'s desire to maintain good relations with
America supplanted the threats of US military force (which still
remained a significant background factor) as the primary deterrent
against pushing its claims to Taiwan.]{.underline}

Even [certain active military space technology can be a force for
stability in international relation]{.underline}s,
[especially]{.underline} in regard to ballistic missile defence (BMD).
[BMD]{.underline} is "based on target-detection, recognition, tracking
and destruction systems," and is becoming more advanced with the use of
outer space to support this technology.45 Although [many states accepted
the international norms that accompanied the non-proliferation treaty
and the greater nonproliferation regime,]{.underline} certain states had
intentions not aligned with these principles. These are defined as rogue
states and, at present, are best understood as Iran and North Korea. The
latter of these two has a confirmed nuclear capability, and is in
pursuit of a deliverance system that will fundamentally be a threat to
the United States, South Korea, Japan, and overall international
stability if acquired. A nuclear North Korea, accompanied by the rise of
global terrorist organizations, which have openly expressed their desire
to acquire nuclear weapons, means that there could well be a number of
rogue actors that threaten the use of nuclear weapons in a limited
capacity. Certain states are currently pursuing the development of more
advanced missile defense capabilities that will employ space-based
interceptor components to compliment sea- and ground-based missile
defense systems as part of a layered defense designed to intercept
missiles at three separate points of their flight trajectory. The use of
this military space technology is purported to be a stabilizing force in
international relations, as sustained by Goodlad, who argues, "[missile
defense plays an important role in providing protection against the
possibility of a rogue strike, offering reassurance to the population
that some sort of cover is in place]{.underline}." 46 "Missile defense
[serves the purpose of countering the threat of a limited
strike]{.underline}," also expressed as "nuclear blackmail," which is "a
belligerent state launching or threatening the launch of either a single
or very small number of missiles, having judged that such action would
not provoke a full-scale response." [47 BMD acts as an important
deterrent in a state's decision to launch a limited strike, as it would
"prompt the aggressor state to launch more missiles in order to ensure
an effective strike, to the point where a response would be
inevitable]{.underline}." 48 Since a limited strike is out of the
question, and mutually assured destruction (MAD) accompanies a full
strike, [BMD has the power of "limiting the ability of states to use
their ballistic missiles as a diplomatic tool to gain greater influence
and power]{.underline}." 49

Scientists, part of a project conducted by the program on U.S.-Korea

https://www.cfr.org/blog/can-north-korea-be-deterred)

Each time the world witnesses cycles of North Korean provocations or
nuclear diplomacy, or both, Korea watchers and specialists question
whether deterrence is possible or feasible. [The answer to this question
has become more complex over the past several decades because the object
of deterrence---the number of undesirable North Korean actions---has
grown in tandem with Pyongyang's growing military
capabilities.]{.underline} The expanding scale, scope, and number of
North Korean actions the United States and South Korea wish to deter
has, in turn, naturally caused confusion in the international discourse,
resulting in frequent use of the term "deterrence" without clarifying
the target(s) of deterrence and by conflating the definitions of
deterrence, compellence, and other foreign policy tools. Any answer to
the fundamental question of whether deterrence is possible vis-à-vis
North Korea depends on the target(s) of deterrence, which necessitates a
clear definition of deterrence and clarification of the target
behavior(s) for deterrence. Based on this clarification, the policy
objective can then be defined, followed by an identification of the
appropriate foreign policy tools to use to achieve the designated
objective.

Deterrence is a strategy aimed at discouraging an adversary from taking
an unwanted action (usually military in nature) by raising the cost of
that action and instilling credible fear of the consequences. Nuclear
deterrence discourages an adversary from using nuclear weapons for fear
of retaliation. Once an adversary has already taken an unwanted action,
however, deterrence has failed and the question becomes one of
compellence---persuading or forcing an adversary to give up something it
already possesses or to terminate an ongoing action(s)---or the use of
other policy tools. Compellence is harder to execute than deterrence
because it requires persuading an adversary to change its existing
behavior (e.g., taking an action it otherwise would not take) and a
credible commitment to act against the adversary by imposing costs
(e.g., threat to inflict punishment) in the event the adversary refuses
to comply, or actually executing a costly action (e.g., following
through on the threat), both with a deadline. Deterrence, on the other
hand, is not associated with a deadline to act against an adversary.

In the case of North Korea, one objective of deterrence was to
discourage North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons, but after
Pyongyang crossed that threshold, the question turned into one of
compellence: how to compel the regime to relinquish its nuclear weapons
while simultaneously deterring it from using those weapons. However, due
to the risks involved, to this day no American administration has
considered the use of a compellence strategy. Potential risks of
compellence include reputational consequences, undermined credibility,
and military escalation. Opposition by Northeast Asian countries and
North Korea's ability to retaliate would also deter the United States
from lodging compellent threats against Pyongyang. Though President
Donald J. Trump's "fire and fury" rhetoric in 2017 resembled compellent
threats, they were largely viewed as bluster that lacked credibility and
pandered to his domestic audience. Nevertheless, Trump's rhetoric was
dangerous because of the possibility that it could have spiraled into
inadvertent conflict. Since the 1990s, the United States has used
diplomacy, rather than compellance, as the preferred foreign policy tool
to attempt to denuclearize North Korea.

From Deterrence to Complexity

The United States' deterrence record is spotty vis-à-vis North Korea,
and a judgement of its success or failure hinges on the definition of
deterrence's ultimate target behavior(s) or action(s). There have been
some clear failures and the jury is still out on whether the United
States' two areas of success---preventing armed conflict and North
Korea's use of a nuclear weapon---will remain successes going forward.
Meanwhile, the current summitry to denuclearize the regime could result
in success, failure, modest progress, or maintenance of the status quo.

[The target of U.S. deterrence has evolved and expanded over time with
Pyongyang's development of its military capabilities.]{.underline} After
the 1950-1953 Korean War, the objective of deterrence was to discourage
North Korea from invading the South again and from engaging in acts of
terrorism. The main deterrent against North Korean aggression was (and
remains) the U.S.-South Korea alliance, operationalized by the
stationing of U.S. troops on and around the peninsula, maintenance of
American nuclear weapons on South Korean territory until 1991, provision
of the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent (or nuclear umbrella) over South
Korea, and the conducting of combined defensive military exercises every
year. These components constitute a deterrence strategy by providing the
capability to impose costs in the event North Korea acts aggressively
(e.g., invades or attacks the South), and they demonstrate America's
resolve and political will to act (e.g. threat of retaliation) in the
event of North Korean aggression. Deterrence, however, has failed to
prevent Pyongyang from engaging in numerous provocations (limited,
calculated acts of aggression beyond nuclear and missile tests) and acts
of terrorism over the past fifty years that have resulted in the deaths
of American and South Korean civilians and soldiers.

In the early 1990s during the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton
administrations, the objective of deterrence continued to lie in
preventing another war, but with an additional target: deterring North
Korea's acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability. Deterrence
continued to succeed in preventing another armed military invasion of
the South, but failed to prevent North Korea's acquisition of nuclear
technology for military purposes. As such, the policy question was no
longer one of deterrence because Pyongyang eventually obtained nuclear
technology and capability. However, compellence was not a politically
feasible or a credible course of action either. In 1993, President Bill
Clinton lodged a deterrent threat, not a compellent threat: "We would
overwhelmingly retaliate if \[the North Koreans\] were to ever use, to
develop and use nuclear weapons. It would mean the end of their country
as they know it.\" His administration even prepared military strike
operations targeting the Yongbyon nuclear complex, but was deterred from
executing them ecause of Seoul's opposition (e.g., fear of escalating
into another war) and former President Jimmy Carter's trip to Pyongyang.
The Clinton administration quickly pivoted to a focus on diplomatic
negotiations to roll back North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

In the early 2000s during the George W. Bush administration, the number
of North Korean actions the United States sought to deter expanded
because North Korean military capabilities and "bad behavior" increased.
These targets included deterring Pyongyang from further advancing its
nuclear weapons arsenal (through vertical proliferation, nuclear tests,
and missile flight tests), to waging a range of provocations beyond
nuclear and missile tests, and engaging in horizontal proliferation (the
transfer of WMD parts and technology) and illicit activities. Deterrence
has yet to succeed in these areas, and many Korea watchers would argue
that it has already failed. Still, although U.S. policy through the Six
Party Talks (2003--2008) failed to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear
programs, deterrence continued to prevent a North Korean invasion and
the use of a nuclear weapon during the Bush administration.

[During the Barack Obama administration from 2009 to 2017, the targets
of deterrence expanded even further due to reports that Pyongyang had
the ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on a
missile. The prevention of malicious cyber operations emerged as another
target of deterrence.]{.underline} During this time, deterrence failed
to prevent provocative acts such as North Korea's shelling of South
Korea's Yeonpyeong Island and the sinking of the Cheonan corvette in
2010, while the United States dissuaded Seoul from retaliating due to
concerns over potential escalation. Instead, in response to Pyongyang's
ongoing nuclear and missile testing, Washington and Seoul increased
their deterrence capabilities by incorporating U.S. strategic assets
(such as B-52 bombers flying over the Korean Peninsula) and including
decapitation exercises in their combined military drills. These measures
were intended to assure South Korea of the United States' security
commitment and to send a deterrence message to the North. [But
Pyongyang's provocations and continued advancements in its nuclear
weapons capability elicited increasing debate and anxiety in Seoul about
Washington's commitment to its extended deterrent and the effectiveness
of the alliance's deterrence posture and capabilities. Stronger
deterrence posture and capabilities also stoked fears among some circles
in Seoul and Washington that Pyongyang could misperceive measures
intended to assure U.S. allies as offensive actions aimed at the
North.]{.underline}

[Deterrence, meanwhile, continued to succeed in preventing North Korea
from using its nuclear weapons or attempting to invade the South during
the Obama administration]{.underline}, but failed to discourage
Pyongyang from conducting more nuclear and missile tests, enhancing its
nuclear arsenal, and engaging in other asymmetric provocations such as
cyberattacks on Sony and South Korean banks and government sites. U.S.
diplomacy also failed to terminate Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs.

Deterrence Challenges During Summitry and Beyond

Today, the overall targets of deterrence continue to be preventing North
Korea from starting another war, using nuclear weapons, and waging
provocations outside the realm of nuclear tests and long-range ballistic
missile launches. The aim of U.S. policy, meanwhile, remains to
dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear weapons capability through the ongoing,
yet uncertain, summit process.

The United States should continue to use diplomatic negotiations as its
main foreign policy tool to denuclearize North Korea while maintaining a
robust deterrence posture. However, in this uncertain period of détente
the United States and its allies face challenges in deterring North
Korea from taking a wide range of undesirable actions. First, Trump has
identified the testing of nuclear devices and long-range ballistic
missiles as red lines, suggesting that his target of deterrence is the
suspension of these tests only, without publicly articulating any costs
he will impose if Pyongyang resumes testing. This perception provides
Pyongyang with a free pass to wage other forms of provocations, such as
the testing of short-range ballistic missiles in May, which threatens
South Koreans and Americans living in the South and confounds U.S.-South
Korea missile defenses. It also allows the regime to continue
mass-producing and advancing nuclear weapons without restrictions or
consequences.

Second, [Trump's unilateral cancellation of U.S.-South Korean combined
military exercises, abruptly announced at the June 2018 Singapore
summit, weakens the allies' military readiness and
inter-operability]{.underline}, which are critical for maintaining the
capabilities that are the linchpin in the U.S.-South Korea deterrence
posture. The move satisfied Pyongyang's demands for an end to these
drills, which it claims are rehearsals for war, but many Korea watchers
worry that the cancellation of combined exercises weakens the allies'
readiness against North Korean aggression and is a stepping stone to
eventually ridding U.S. troops from the peninsula and breaking the
U.S.-South Korean alliance. While these large-scale drills were replaced
with smaller-scale command post exercises and revised field training
programs to provide space for diplomacy, [they have not led to material
changes to North Korea's military posture or readiness, or incentivized
Pyongyang to take meaningful denuclearization measures]{.underline}.
General Robert Abrams, commander of the U.S.-South Korea Combined Forces
Command, testified in February that North Korea's military continued its
winter training exercise with the same size, scope, and timing as
previous years.

Third, progressive South Korean administrations are more reluctant than
their conservative counterparts to take any measures that could
aggravate the North. This makes it more difficult to respond, even
proportionately, to North Korean provocations during periods of
engagement. Pyongyang has further complicated matters with its
exploitation of the gray zone between war and peace by engaging in
aggressive and coercive actions that narrowly skirt the border between
provocation of escalation and conflict. [Most recently, North Korea
launched two rounds of short-range solid-fuel ballistic missiles in May
and reportedly waged cyberattacks on the United States, South Korea, and
ally nations after Trump and Kim met in Singapore last June and during
the February Hanoi summit this year. Proportionate reactions using
diplomatic, economic, and information tools do not need to trigger
escalation or sever dialogue channels. However, turning a blind eye to
lower-level provocations only enables North Korea to continue these
offenses and sends the wrong message that it can still seek considerable
advantage, influence, and damage without crossing Trump's red
lines.]{.underline}

If the target of deterrence is to prevent another war and the use of a
nuclear weapon, then the United States should maintain a robust
deterrence posture and capabilities, which have so far proven to achieve
this objective. But if the object of deterrence is to dissuade all bad
behavior by North Korea---including but not limited to further nuclear
and missile testing, a military attack or invasion of South Korea,
disruptive cyber operations, illicit financial activities, acts of
terrorism, production and use of chemical and biological weapons, and
conventional military provocations short of war---then the United States
should employ a comprehensive policy that incorporates a spectrum of
tools spanning diplomacy, modern and tailored deterrence, and gray-zone
tactics. [As North Korea's military arsenal expands and becomes more
sophisticated with the incorporation of new technologies, America's
toolkit and policy must also evolve.]{.underline}

International Relations at the Powell School, City College of New York,

Lead Us Straight Into Nuclear Disaster", The Nation, 6/5/17,
https://www.thenation.com/article/trumps-handling-north-korea-going-lead-us-straight-nuclear-disaster/)

Defense Secretary James Mattis remarked recently that a war with North
Korea would be "tragic on an unbelievable scale." No kidding. "Tragic"
doesn't even begin to describe the horrors that would flow from such a
conflict.

The Korean peninsula, all 85,270 square miles of it, is about the size
of Idaho. It contains more soldiers (2.8 million, not counting reserves)
and armaments (nearly 6,000 tanks, 31,000 artillery pieces, and 1,134
combat aircraft) than any other place on the planet. The armies of North
and South Korea face each other across the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ,
and Seoul, South Korea's capital, is a mere 35 miles away as the
artillery shell flies. More than 25 million people inhabit that city's
greater metropolitan area, home to about half of South Korea's
population. Unsurprisingly, untold numbers of North Korean missiles and
artillery pieces are trained on that city. Once the guns started firing,
thousands of its denizens would undoubtedly die within hours. Of course,
North Koreans, too, would be caught in an almost instant maelstrom of
death.

And the war wouldn't be a bilateral affair. South Korea hosts 28,500
American troops. In addition, there are some 200,000 American civilians
in the country, most of them in Seoul. Many in both categories could be
killed by North Korean attacks and the United States would, in turn, hit
multiple targets in that country. Pyongyang might retaliate by firing
missiles at Japan, where 39,000 American troops are stationed,
concentrating on the network of American bases and command centers
there, especially the US Services Headquarters at Yokota Air Base near
Tokyo.

And that's without even considering the possible use of nuclear weapons.
If anything, Mattis's description is an understatement. And don't assume
that the danger of a Korean conflagration has passed now that President
Trump has become trapped in the latest set of political scandals to
plague his administration. Quite the opposite: A clash between North
Korea and the United States might have become more probable precisely
because the president is politically besieged.

Trump wouldn't be the first leader, confronted with trouble at home, to
trigger a crisis abroad and then appeal for unity and paint critics as
unpatriotic. Keep in mind, after all, that this is the man who has
already warned of "a major, major war" with North Korea.

TRUMP VS. KIM

[So far the coercive tactics Trump has used to compel North Korea to
dismantle its nuclear weapons program and cease testing ballistic
missiles have included sanctions and asset freezes, military
threats,]{.underline} and shows of force---both serious, as in the
recent Key Resolve and Operation Max Thunder joint military exercises
with South Korea, and farcical, as with a supposedly northward-bound
naval "armada" that [actually sailed in the opposite
direction]{.underline}.

Such moves all involve the same presidential bet: that economic and
military pressure can bend Pyongyang to his will. Other American
presidents have, of course, taken the same approach and failed for
decades now, which seems to matter little to Trump, even though he
presents himself as a break-the-mold maverick ready to negotiate
unprecedented deals with foreign leaders.

By now, this much ought to be clear, even to Trump: [North Korea hasn't
been cowed into compliance by Washington's warnings and military muscle
flexing.]{.underline} In 2003, after multilateral diplomatic efforts to
denuclearize North Korea ran aground, Pyongyang ditched the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and two years later declared that it
possessed nuclear weapons. In October 2006, it detonated its first
nuclear device, a one-kiloton bomb. Four other tests in May 2009,
February 2013, January 2016, and September 2016, ranging in explosive
yield from four to 10 kilotons, followed. Three of them occurred after
the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, came to power in April
2012.

A similar pattern holds for ballistic missiles, which North Korea has
been testing since 1993. The numbers have risen steadily under Kim
Jong-un, from four tests in 2012 to 25 in 2016.

Clearly, the North's leaders reject the proposition that American
approval is required for them to build nuclear bombs and ballistic
missiles. Like his father, Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, Kim
Il-sung, the founder of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or
DPRK, North Korea's official name), [Kim]{.underline} [Jong-un is an
ardent nationalist who regularly responds to threats by upping the
ant]{.underline}e. Trump's national security adviser, General H.R.
McMaster, characterized Kim as "unpredictable." In reality, the Korean
leader, like his father and grandfather before him, has been remarkably
consistent: He has steadfastly refused to stop testing either nuclear
weapons or their possible delivery systems, let alone "denuclearize" the
Korean peninsula, as McMaster demanded.

[Indeed, from Pyongyang's perspective Trump may be the unpredictable
one]{.underline}. On one day, amid press reports that the Pentagon was
considering a preventive strike using means ranging from Tomahawk cruise
missiles to cyber attacks, the president declared ominously that North
Korea "is a problem, a problem that will be taken care of." He followed
up by warning Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he was then hosting at
his Mar-a-Lago estate, that if China wouldn't rein in Kim, the United
States would act alone. Not so long after, Trump suddenly praised Kim,
calling him a "pretty smart cookie," presumably impressed that the North
Korean leader wasn't even 30 years old when he succeeded his father. On
yet another day, the president announced that he would be "honored" to
meet Kim under the right circumstances and would do so "absolutely."

[The roller-coaster ride otherwise known as the presidency of Donald
Trump has many people perplexed. Trump's boosters believe that the
president's unpredictability gives him leverage against adversaries. But
in the event of a military crisis on the Korean peninsula, Trump's
pendulum-like behavior could lead North Korea's leaders to conclude that
they had best prepare for the worst---and so strike first. That prospect
makes the Kim-Trump combination not just dangerous but quite possibly
deadly.]{.underline}

OLD CLAIMS, NEW POSSIBILITIES

Standing in the way of a fresh policy toward North Korea are a set of
assumptions beloved within the Washington Beltway and by the foreign
policy establishment beyond it---and rarely challenged in the mainstream
media.

Perhaps the most common of them is that diplomacy and conciliation
toward North Korea won't work because its leaders only respond to
pressure. So pervasive and deeply rooted is this view that it makes
fresh thinking about Pyongyang next to impossible.

[Given the failure of both sanctions and saber rattling, however, a new
approach would have to involve diplomacy (in case you've forgotten that
word) and serious negotiations with the North. Here's one possible way
to go that might, in fact, make a difference.]{.underline}

North Korea would agree, in principle, to dismantle its nuclear weapons
installations, rejoin the NPT, and allow comprehensive inspections by
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify its compliance.
Concurrently, the United States would pledge not to attack North Korea
or topple its regime and to move toward normalization of political
relations.

Major steps taken by North Korea on the path to denuclearization would
be matched by cuts in American military forces in South Korea. Once
Pyongyang delivered completely, the United States would remove all its
forces and fully lift economic sanctions on the North.

The United States, South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia would undertake
to fund and, for some of its future energy needs, build new Light-Water
Reactors (LWRs), which reduce the risk of bomb-grade plutonium
production. These would be subject to regular inspections and electronic
surveillance by the IAEA and all spent fuel would be transported out of
North Korea. The dismantling of the North's nuclear facilities, verified
by intermittent inspections and continuous electronic monitoring,
would---as in the nuclear deal with Iran---prevent the production of
weapons-grade plutonium (PU-239) or uranium (UR-235)

Once these steps were completed, both Koreas would begin to pull back
their troops massed along the Demilitarized Zone and so create an even
wider region free of weapons and troops between the two countries. They
would agree not to reintroduce troops and armaments into the vacated
areas and to allow monitoring by international observers. Over perhaps a
10-year span the two states would commit to additional military
pullbacks plus reductions in the number of weapons each possessed,
focusing on retiring those most suited to offensive warfare.

If Trump is indeed prepared to meet with Kim, it should be to do a deal
along these lines, not to deliver in person the sort of ultimatums that
the North has rejected for years.

THE DIPLOMACY-WON'T-WORK TROPE

Typically, proposals like these are dismissed on the grounds that they
combine the worst of all worlds: the appeasement of a despotic regime
and reckless naïveté.

Let's start with the appeasement charge, the gist of which seems to be
that Pyongyang's cruelties bar diplomatic engagement with it. This claim
amounts to sanctimonious puffery and historical amnesia. The United
States has, in various forms, supported a vast array of despotic
regimes, including Greece during the brutal "regime of the colonels"
(1967-74); Indonesia under Suharto (who presided over the slaughter of
half a million people in 1965-1966); and Iraq under Saddam Hussein
during the 1980s, when his government was gassing Kurds and razing their
villages. And of course in South Korea there was the US-backed
government of President Syngman Rhee (1948-1960), whose security forces
killed more than 100,000 people, 30,000 to 60,000 in the infamous 1948
Cheju massacre alone, as part of an effort to decimate any left-wing
opposition in the country.

[Counting on China, Pyongyang's principal benefactor, or Russia to
squeeze North Korea so that it undertakes far-reaching reforms amounts
to wishful thinking. Neither country wants to trigger instability there
for fear that the country might collapse, creating mayhem on its borders
and releasing a floodtide of refugees that they would have to deal with.
In addition, China views the North as a buffer with South Korea, an
American ally and a forward base for US military power.]{.underline}
From Beijing's vantage point, if changes in North Korea careened out of
control, the eventual result could be a unified Korean state allied with
Washington. For the Chinese, the status quo on the peninsula, while
anything but ideal, beats such a roll of the dice. [Beijing has been
willing to impose sanctions on Pyongyang and sees it as mercurial and
reckless, but it is not about to strangle it economically.]{.underline}

As for the charge of naïveté when it comes to a proposal to begin the
partial demilitarization of the peninsula, that's part and parcel of
prevailing Washington orthodoxy, a deep conviction that North Korea will
never surrender its nuclear weapons as part of a grand bargain. In fact,
progress toward just such a denuclearization was made during Bill
Clinton's presidency, when the sticks were briefly put aside and the
carrots brought out. In October 1994, negotiations led to what was
called the Agreed Framework.

Its details are complicated, so brace yourself for a barebones summary:
North Korea agreed to shut down its reactor at Yongbyon, place the
plant's spent fuel in sealed containers for shipment out of the country,
stop construction on two larger reactors (at Yongbyon and Taechon),
remain a party to the NPT, and permit the IAEA to inspect its nuclear
sites to verify the agreement's implementation. In exchange, the United
States, Japan, and South Korea undertook, through a consortium, to build
two light-water reactors (LWRs) suitable for generating electricity but
not for producing weapons-grade plutonium and to provide Pyongyang with
500,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil pending the completion of the
reactors.

Eventually the Agreed Framework fell apart, a development for which all
the parties share blame. North Korea's ongoing missile tests, while not
banned by the deal, bolstered the accord's critics in Washington. It
also faced resistance in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives, which in 1994 were, for the first time in four decades,
in Republican hands, while the Clinton administration proved inept in
defending the agreement. Having stopped producing plutonium at Yongbyon,
North Korea complained about the delay in building the LWRs. (Work on
the first reactor didn't start until August 2002.) The South Korean
government, stuck with partially funding those plants, was
unenthusiastic, too.

The Bush administration arrived in office in 2001 ready to shred the
Agreed Framework. Soon enough, however, it sought to resurrect a version
of that deal during the "Six-Party Talks," which began in 2003 and
included both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China, and Japan.

Here again the details are labyrinthine, but the basic formula that
emerged did indeed resemble the Agreed Framework: North Korea was to
receive both those LWRs and economic aid in exchange for freezing and
then dismantling its nuclear program. The North Koreans even allowed
American and other technical experts to observe it shutting down the
Yongbyon reactor. It also provided reams---18,000 pages to be exact---of
documentation on its nuclear program. Most importantly, having frozen
plutonium production in 1994, it continued to do so until 2003.

For its part, the Bush administration removed North Korea from the State
Department's list of countries accused of sponsoring terrorism and
exempted it from the Trading with the Enemy Act.

There were also threats, theatrics, and setbacks aplenty. In the end,
the Six-Party Talks failed for reasons similar to those that killed the
Agreed Framework: quarrels over the nature and scope of verification
procedures, North Korea's missile tests and confirmation of reports that
it had embarked on efforts to build uranium-based nuclear weapons, and
UN sanctions. President George W. Bush, of course, included that
country, along with Iran and Iraq, in what he infamously termed the
"axis of evil," which he called a "grave and growing danger" in his
January 2002 State of the Union address. His administration also listed
North Korea in the 2002 Nuclear Posture Review as one of the states that
might become the target of a preventive strike.

The lessons to be drawn from this grim record are not that North Korea
will not negotiate, let alone that it won't ever agree to freeze, or
even terminate, its nuclear program. Instead, the history of these
failed deals should be looked to for ideas on better ways to reach a
consensus-based solution.

This much remains clear: The more Pyongyang suspects that Washington's
real goal is regime change, the less likely it will be to relinquish its
nuclear weapons for fear of suffering the fate of Moammar Gadhafi, who
shut down his nuclear program only to be toppled in what began as a US
and NATO humanitarian intervention to protect civilians but morphed
quickly into a campaign to take him out.

NORTH KOREA AND THE LEGACY OF WAR

The notion that North Korea couldn't possibly fear an American attack
and that its claims to the contrary amount to paranoia reflects a
stunning ignorance of history. Between 1950 and 1953, North Korea
experienced firsthand the devastation the American military machine was
capable of inflicting. As Charles Armstrong, a historian of Korea, has
written, in those years "American planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs
on Korea---that is, essentially North Korea---including 32,557 tons of
napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific
theater of World War II." Armstrong estimates that 12 percent--15
percent of the North Korean population might have died, "a figure close
to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War
II."

As happened during the Anglo-American terror bombing of Germany and
Japan, the distinction between civilians and soldiers, so central to
International Humanitarian Law and Just War Theory, was defenestrated.
Many Americans know about the bombing of Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg,
Hiroshima, and Nagasaki and the deliberate targeting of civilians in an
attempt to break their morale. But few know what happened to North Korea
in the early 1950s. In his haunting book, On the Natural History of
Destruction, W.G. Sebald writes that Germans did not discuss the wartime
bombings because Nazi crimes made them hesitant to cast moral judgments
on other states, no matter what they had done to Germany. There has been
no such repression of memory or reticence by the state or the citizenry
of North Korea.

As a result, the usual dismissals of Pyongyang's apprehension about what
the United States might do to a denuclearized country are both callous
and foolish. [Successful negotiations would mean taking its security
concerns seriously, not rejecting them as paranoid demands, especially
given that American military power remains so close, that Washington has
threatened to attack the North more than once, and that the American
president only recently boasted to the president of the Philippines (in
a conversation leaked online) of the two US nuclear submarines that were
evidently somewhere off the North Korean coast at that
moment.]{.underline}

### 2nc -- alt cause -- nk proliferation

#### Multiple reasons why NK proliferates -- retaining regime, domestic legacy, reunification, leverage

**Kilinger '18** (Bruce Kilinger, senior research fellow on Northeast
Asia at The Heritage Foundation, "Why Does North Korea Want Nukes?", The
Heritage Foundation, 8/13/18,
https://www.heritage.org/insider/summer-2018-insider/why-does-north-korea-want-nukes)Q

[Pyongyang's Multiple Objectives]{.underline}

For decades, debate has raged over North Korea's motivations for
developing nuclear weapons. Initially, the dispute was whether Pyongyang
was building a military capability or merely a negotiating chip to be
bargained away for economic and diplomatic benefits. Today, some experts
assess North Korea seeks only a nuclear arsenal sufficient to deter a
U.S. attack. Conversely, others perceive a desire to use nuclear weapons
to achieve unification of the Korean Peninsula on the North's terms or
to attack the United States.

The U.S. Intelligence Community has "long assessed that Pyongyang's
nuclear capabilities are intended for deterrence, international
prestige, and coercive diplomacy." From Pyongyang's perspective, having
nuclear weapons makes eminent sense since it concurrently fulfills
several long-standing foreign policy objectives:

[Regime survival, by deterring allied attacks or
retaliations]{.underline} in response to North Korean provocations;

[Source of national pride]{.underline}, by achieving equal status with
the United States;

[Domestic legitimacy and international prestige for the
leadership]{.underline};

[Tremendous military power, overcoming deficiencies in conventional
forces to achieve reunification;]{.underline}

Formidable leverage for coercive diplomacy, to wrest concessions and
benefits;

Undermining of the U.S.-South Korean alliance, by sowing doubt that
Washington would come to Seoul's defense once the American homeland is
under nuclear threat.

[Regime Survival. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un claims his nuclear
force constitutes" a powerful deterrent that prevents \[the United
States\] from starting an adventurous war." Pyongyang justifies its
nuclear weapons as guaranteed protection against the U.S. "hostile
policy" of intimidation, military attacks, and regime change against
authoritarian regimes.]{.underline} The North Korean military supreme
command declared: "This land is neither the Balkans nor Iraq and Libya."

Pyongyang's military threats, including the colorful taunt to turn
Washington and Seoul into a "sea of fire," are usually issued in a
conditional context, depicting them as a response to any U.S. attack. In
his 2018 New Year's Day speech, Kim Jong-un declared: "As a responsible
nuclear weapons state, our Republic will not use a nuclear weapon unless
its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with
nukes."

North Korea Stands Alone. Contrary to widespread misperception of a
close Chinese-North Korean political relationship, Pyongyang feels
threatened by its neighbor to the north as well as by the United States
since Beijing has acquiesced to joining in sanctions against North
Korea. All three generations of North Korean leadership have warned of
the dangers of Chinese intimidation. A traditional Korean adage depicts
the peninsula as a "shrimp amongst whales."

The North Korean nuclear program was born in the 1960s due to the
perception that the regime couldn't rely on either of its superpower
allies---the Soviet Union and China---for its defense. Moscow was seen
as having abandoned Havana during the Cuban missile crisis, and Beijing
refused to share information from its nuclear tests.

[North Korea sees nuclear weapons as a means of gaining equal status
with the United States.]{.underline} Pyongyang has long sought formal
recognition as a nuclear weapons state in order to deal with Washington
from a position of equity. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told
the UN General Assembly that Pyongyang's ultimate goal is to "establish
the balance of power with the U.S."

[Leadership Legitimacy. Even more than his father and grandfather, Kim
Jong-un has linked his personal prestige to the country's nuclear and
ICBM programs.]{.underline} Lacking the revolutionary credentials or
lengthy government tenure of his predecessors, Kim embraces the programs
and the breakthroughs in recent years as his exclusive contribution to
fulfilling long-standing regime objectives and defending the country.

North Korean official media frequently release photos of Kim attending
missile launches, lauding him as the visionary and driving force. Kim is
thus able to convey an image of infallibility and invincibility which
helps secure his control of power. By declaring that the nuclear button
is on his desk, Kim portrays himself as uniquely qualified to defend the
country.

Military Capability. Nuclear devices are the ultimate weapon and give
North Korea the power to wreak havoc on its neighbors and the United
States. Pyongyang already has the ability to target South Korea and
Japan with nuclear weapons and is nearing completion of longer-range
missiles to hit U.S. bases in Guam and the American homeland. Last year,
the regime successfully tested two ICBM variants and an H-bomb with at
least 10 times the explosive power of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic
bombs.

[North Korea is developing several means to ensure greater survivability
of its missile forces, enhancing both a preemptive first-strike and
retaliatory second-strike capability.]{.underline} Pyongyang is testing
several different solid-fueled missiles which require less fueling time,
along with mobile ground-based launchers and submarine-launched
ballistic missiles. The regime has also practiced missile launches under
wartime conditions by firing them from diverse locations throughout the
country and conducting salvo launches of several missiles
simultaneously.

Enhancing Coercive Diplomacy. Attaining an unambiguous nuclear ICBM
capability could lead Pyongyang to perceive it has immunity from any
international response. This might tempt the regime to act even more
belligerently, trying to intimidate the United States and its allies
into accepting North Korean diktats. The regime could also use rising
international fear of its nuclear prowess to pressure other Six-Party
Talks participants to abandon denuclearization as their goal and instead
accept limitations on North Korea's nuclear programs in return for
diplomatic and economic concessions.

Decoupling the Alliances. North Korea has long sought to drive a wedge
between the United States and its partners by depicting Seoul's alliance
with Washington as the impediment to improved inter-Korean relations and
eventual reunification. Characteristically, Kim Jong-un declared in his
2018 New Year's Day speech: "the North and the South improve the
relations between themselves and take decisive measures for achieving a
breakthrough for independent reunification" without U.S. interference.
Doing so, however, requires South Korea to "discontinue all the nuclear
war drills they stage with outside forces \[and\] refrain from any acts
of bringing in nuclear armaments and aggressive forces from the United
States."

Pyongyang's approaching ability to target the continental United States
with nuclear weapons has aggravated allied concerns about U.S.
capability, resolve, and willingness to defend their countries. This
trend is most prevalent in South Korea, which fears the United States
"wouldn't trade Los Angeles for Seoul." This, coupled with growing
anxiety that the United States is contemplating a preventive attack on
North Korea, has led some in South Korea to advocate a more independent
policy from Washington.

How Does North Korea Achieve Its Objectives?

For decades, North Korea was able to keep the world at bay as it pursued
nuclear weapons and ICBM programs, first in secret and then in open
defiance of UN resolutions. The regime was able to do so through a
comprehensive multi-faceted strategy of "deny, deceive, and delay."

Preparing the Battlefield---Demanding a Price for Attending
Negotiations. North Korea often achieved several objectives prior to
even entering the negotiating venue. Pyongyang would fortify its
bargaining position by conditioning its return on receiving preliminary
concessions from its opponents as well as determining the agenda so that
it reflected North Korean policy priorities.

By holding out the promise of returning to the talks rather than issuing
an outright rejection, North Korea sought to portray itself as a
reasonable negotiating partner. Pyongyang would signal it was interested
in resuming negotiations while concurrently rejecting U.S. preconditions
by characterizing them as insufficient. Doing so put Washington on the
defensive and susceptible to additional pressure from China (and from
South Korea, when it had Left-leaning governments) to provide greater
U.S. "flexibility."

"Good Cop, Bad Cop"---Creating the Illusion of Factionalism. North Korea
long cultivated the image of factional infighting between "engagers" and
"hardliners" as a negotiating tool. In fact, the ministries of foreign
affairs and defense were simply playing the roles of good cop and bad
cop in order to gain maximum diplomatic and economic benefits. In the
words of a Korean adage, "the same animal has sharp claws and soft fur."

Raising Brinksmanship to an Art Form. Pyongyang escalated tensions to
define negotiating parameters and extract maximum benefits for minimal
concessions. North Korean brinksmanship raised the price of an eventual
deal, slowed down the negotiating process until opponents were willing
to meet North Korean terms, and created a parallel crisis to divert
attention from a negotiating impasse.

[North Korea's escalation is opportunistic rather than reactive to U.S.
actions. By moving up the escalatory ladder, North Korea retains the
initiative and controls the pace of the game, forcing the United States
and others to respond. Raising tensions may gain Pyongyang what it
desires or at least expose fault lines in a coalition that North Korea
can then exploit. Pyongyang believes it can force the United States to
negotiate either by applying leverage directly on Washington or
indirectly through its allies.]{.underline}

Two-track Diplomatic Strategy. [Pyongyang often used a combination of
threats and assurances to garner diplomatic and economic support from
China, Russia, and South Korea by raising the specter of a deteriorating
security situation.]{.underline}

Pyongyang's two-track strategy complicated U.S. attempts to gain Chinese
and Russian support for imposing sanctions. North Korea's seeming
reasonableness encouraged Beijing and Moscow to resist tough enforcement
of the trade sanctions, let alone U.S. demands for additional sanctions
beyond those mandated by the UN.

Inching Across the Redline. Pyongyang used the years of negotiating
foot-dragging and delays to augment its stockpile from an estimated one
to two nuclear weapons at the end of the 1990s to enough fissile
material for approximately 30 or more weapons today.

Under Kim Jong-il, North Korea's strategy had been to build slowly
toward an escalatory act, thereby allowing the United States and its
allies sufficient time to offer new diplomatic or economic inducements.
On those occasions when North Korea carried out the act, it followed
with several months of calm to allow all countries to become accustomed
to the new elevated status quo prior to initiating the next lengthy
provocation process.

Unlike his father, Kim Jong-un has eschewed engagement, maneuvering for
negotiations, and charm offensives. Kim fils preferred an all-out sprint
to cross the finish line of a viable nuclear weapons and ICBM
capability. He lost an opportunity to induce liberal Presidents Obama
and Moon Jae-in to offer benefits and move away from pressure tactics.
Kim's hardline strategy drove the international community into greater
consensus on the need to punish and pressure the recalcitrant regime.

But Kim's 2018 New Year Day speech may have marked a turning point. In
it, he [extended an olive branch to Seoul which was quickly grasped by
President Moon in order to lower tensions on the peninsula. Bilateral
discussions led to an agreement for a North Korean team to join the
Olympics in South Korea. Skepticism abounds as to how sincere or
effective Kim Jong-un's charm offensive will be, since all previous
Korean reconciliation efforts collapsed.]{.underline}

[Too High a Cost. If Kim shows a willingness to return to nuclear
negotiations, it would come with a price. Pyongyang has always coupled
diplomatic outreach with an ambitious list of demands,
including:]{.underline}

Military: the end of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, removal of
U.S. troops from South Korea, abrogation of the bilateral defense
alliance between the United States and South Korea, cancellation of the
U.S. extended-deterrence guarantee, and worldwide dismantlement of all
U.S. nuclear weapons;

Political: establishment of formal diplomatic relations with the United
States, signing of a peace treaty to end the Korean War, and no action
on the U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on North Korean human rights
abuses;

Law enforcement: removal of all U.N. sanctions, U.S. sanctions, EU
sanctions, and targeted financial measures; and

Societal: restrictions on South Korean constitutionally protected
freedoms of speech and assembly, including suppressing the publication
of "insulting" articles by South Korean media and forbidding anti-North
Korean public demonstrations in Seoul.

Conclusion

How one interprets the motivations driving North Korea's nuclear weapons
program influences one's views on the appropriate U.S. policy response.
A belief that the primary purpose is defensive leads to advocacy for
pursuing a negotiated freeze on the regime's nuclear program.
Theoretically, a freeze could lead to denuclearization.

At the other end of the spectrum, an assessment that [Pyongyang's
dominant reason for a nuclear arsenal is to invade South Korea and
achieve Korean unification leads to advocacy for a U.S. preventive
attack before Pyongyang achieves an ICBM capability. A middle viewpoint
is that the North's nuclear weapons are more than a benign defense
mechanism, but that the regime is unlikely to initiate an invasion as
long as the U.S.-South Korean alliance remains strong. As such, the best
policy for the U.S. is a comprehensive strategy of deterrence,
containment, pressure, and eventual regime change.]{.underline}

NORTH KOREA is nothing but trouble for China, its main international
backer. The day before Xi Jinping, China's president, was to due to meet
his American counterpart for their first summit, Kim Jong Un, North
Korea's leader, ordered yet another ballistic-missile test, thumbing his
nose at both presidents and putting on full display his country's
capacity and willingness to cause trouble[. Officially, China wants the
Korean peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons. Yet the North has
dramatically stepped up its weapons programme. The trial of a
medium-range missile on April 5th brought to seven the number of
missiles tested this year, one of which failed.]{.underline} It has also
tested the first-stage rocket of an intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM) capable of hitting America. Last year it conducted two nuclear
tests, put a satellite into orbit and experimented with a
submarine-launched missile for the first time. [China can hardly benefit
from having an aggressive, nuclear-armed and extremely unpredictable
neighbour.]{.underline} Why doesn't it do more to rein Mr Kim in?

[China has done something. It agreed to abide by the most recent round
of United Nations economic sanctions on the North and in February
suspended its purchases of North Korean coal for the rest of the
year.]{.underline} Coal is the largest source of foreign exchange for
the isolated country. Mr Xi is widely thought to be furious at Mr Kim,
blaming him for the assassination in February of his own half-brother,
Kim Jong Nam, who had close ties to China and had lived in Macau under
Chinese protection. [The trouble is that while Chinese policy has
changed a little, American policy seems to be changing a lot. "If China
is not going to solve North Korea, we will,"]{.underline} Donald Trump
recently told the Financial Times. "The policy of strategic patience has
ended," his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said in March, adding,
"All options are on the table." For the Americans, the threat of a North
Korean ICBM capable of hitting California is proving a game-changer.

[Yet even though China fears unilateral American action, it seems
unlikely to make radical policy changes to forestall it.]{.underline}
[Two old reasons for backing the regime in the North have as much force
as ever: China does not want the reunification of the Korean peninsula
if it creates a single, larger American ally]{.underline} on its border.
And [millions of North Koreans might flee from the collapse of their
country into China]{.underline}, exporting instability into China's
three north-eastern provinces, which are among the most economically
depressed in the country. There are also three newer reasons[. First,
the North's missiles are not, for the moment, pointed at
China.]{.underline} But they could be if China turns on its protégé.
[Second, China does not perceive a North Korean ICBM as a profound
threat in the way that the Americans do.]{.underline} [Lastly, China is
worried about South Korea's plans to deploy an American anti-missile
system, called Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence, or THAAD, which it
claims is really aimed at its own missiles.]{.underline} So it continues
to align itself with the North against the South. China, it seems, cares
more about other countries' reaction to North Korea's belligerence than
the belligerence itself.

#### China doesn't control North Korea -- NK independent movements proves 

**Chang '14** (Gordon G. Chang, author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea
Takes On the World", Professor of American History Olive H. Palmer
Professor in Humanities, Director for Center For East Asian Studies, "Be
Afraid: China Can\'t Control North Korea", 4/25/14,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/be-afraid-china-cant-control-north-korea-10310)Q

This month in Beijing, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel asked China's
leader Xi Jinping to do more to disarm North Korea. In February,
Secretary of State John Kerry, when he was in the Chinese capital,
goaded his counterparts on the same topic. President Obama, while
meeting Xi in The Hague during the Nuclear Security Summit in March,
discussed the denuclearization of the North.

The Chinese are getting a little peeved by all this recent attention.
Beijing's ambassador to the United States in the middle of this month
was unhappy about Washington leaning on his country. "You are giving us
a mission impossible," Cui Tiankai said to an audience in the American
capital.

A decade ago, China chose not to use its considerable influence on the
North. Now, from all appearances, it doesn't have much of it. That's
probably why Ambassador Cui complains about receiving impossible
missions from Americans.

Cui certainly remembers what happened in December. Then, Kim Jong-un,
the young North Korean ruler, had his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, executed.
[China not only lost its most influential contact in Pyongyang when Jang
died in a hail of large-caliber rounds, but it also found itself
demonized by the regime as it explained the harsh sentence.]{.underline}

In detailing Jang's crimes, the official Korean Central News Agency on
December 13 made two references to the People's Republic of China: his
selling of "coal and other precious underground resources at random" and
his "selling off the land of the Rason economic and trade zone to a
foreign country for a period of five decades." And the charge of Jang
being "bribed by enemies" is undoubtedly a reference to the Chinese as
well.

[Chinese officials genuinely appeared surprised by Jang's purge and
execution, and that is an indication of how much access and influence
they have lost in Pyongyang in recent years. When Kim Il-sung and Mao
Zedong both ruled, the two states professed to be---and often
were---lips-and-teeth close.]{.underline} Then, both leaders were
communist, Confucian, Chinese-speaking, and chubby. No wonder diplomacy
was conducted on a leader-to-leader basis.

Subsequent generations of rulers on both sides of the border have
drifted apart, however, and the execution of Jang signals a rupture. Kim
Jong-un had given Jang Song Thaek nearly free rein to handle relations
with Beijing. This almost-complete delegation meant that in late 2013,
Kim essentially cut himself off from his biggest benefactor when he
killed his uncle.

[If he had stopped there, relations with Beijing could have been easily
repaired. Kim, however, continued his "reign of terror" and is now
systematically rooting out Jang's nationwide patronage network. As the
young leader does so, he is eliminating underlings who had handled China
matters for Uncle Jang.]{.underline}

While Kim takes down Jang's friends, he is trying to rebuild his
lifeline to the Chinese capital. For instance, he sent Kim Ki-sok to
Beijing and Shenzhen in February looking for Chinese money. The young
leader even seems to have begun rehabilitating some of Jang's allies
because of their China expertise or knowledge. There are reports that
Kim has reinstated two such officials. For instance, the cloud over Ji
Jae-ryong, considered a "linking pin" between Jang and China, has been
lifted, apparently because he is needed to represent the Kim regime in
Beijing.

It is no secret why the North Koreans need China. Chinese cash---in the
form of outright grants as well as the proceeds of trade and
investment---keep the regime afloat. [Yet Kim Jong-un's actions hardly
reflect the growing dependency. The young dictator, after all, felt
confident enough to eliminate most of his officials dealing with China
and he undertook actions---long-range missile tests, a third nuclear
detonation, an abrogation of the Korean War armistice, to name just a
few of them---that appeared to have genuinely upset
Beijing.]{.underline}

Chinese officials have to be asking themselves why their policies,
despite everything, have apparently failed to command the obedience and
respect of their destitute neighbor. Since the death of Kim Jong-il in
December 2011, the balance of power has been tipping in favor of the
weaker party. There are several reasons explaining the seemingly
paradoxical loss of China's clout at a time when the North increasingly
depends on Chinese money.

[First, Chinese authorities, as a practical matter, do not control cash
flowing to the North. Many of China's investments are large-scale and
need formal approval from Pyongyang, giving North Korean officials a
high degree of control over them.]{.underline} Moreover, the North
Koreans have figured out that China is making many of its investments
for strategic purposes, like those at the port of Rason, where the Tumen
River empties into the Sea of Japan---what Koreans call the East
Sea---and where China has no direct access. The North Koreans, knowing
that Beijing must have what only they possess, call the tune. [Finally,
Beijing has lost control of many of the investment flows into the North
because now much of the Chinese money is small-scale and so exits China
under the noses of its regulators.]{.underline}

The Chinese have apparently made a decision to support the Kimist state
with trade and investment, whatever it does or doesn't do to displease
them. Despite Pyongyang's especially provocative behavior in 2013, for
example, the Chinese continued aid, trade, and investment, and the Kim
regime certainly took notice, realizing that Beijing had essentially
delinked economic relations from diplomacy. So China's patience---what
some may call an indulgent attitude---works against Chinese influence.

The [second reason China is losing pull is that pro--North Korean
elements are gaining power in Beijing]{.underline}. By now it is almost
certain that Kim has realized that in recent years the Chinese military
has gained sway in Beijing and that this trend means he need not worry
too much about China's civilian officials, many of whom detest him and
his family.

The apparent ascendance of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA)
profoundly affects ties between Beijing and Pyongyang because the PLA is
given deference on matters involving the Korean peninsula due to the
heavy losses suffered in the Korean War. Chinese military officers are
known to have views favoring the regime in Pyongyang, and it is no
surprise that they do. The ties between Chinese and North Korean
officers are forged in blood, held together by shared perceptions, and
reinforced by business dealings.

It appears, therefore, the ascension of the military in Communist Party
political circles, especially during the recent leadership transition to
Xi Jinping, has given Kim Jong-un immunity---or stronger immunity---in
China. This immunity tends to reduce Beijing's influence. It means, for
one thing, that Kim has the initiative and that Chinese foreign policy
has taken on a more passive tone, a tone of acquiescence even.
Acquiescence, by its nature, represents a loss of influence.

Third, a frustrated Washington is taking China out of the game. At the
beginning of this century, Beijing was becoming the center of peninsular
diplomacy with the start of the six-party talks, which took place in the
Chinese capital. China's diplomats at first assumed that prominent role
with gusto, mediating, cajoling, and at times threatening the five other
parties, especially North Korea and the United States. That, of course,
gave China's diplomats great leverage in their dealings with, among
others, their Pyongyang counterparts.

The special role for the Chinese did not last, however, because Beijing
did not produce results. So the six-party process essentially
disappeared. The Obama foreign policy team, faced with the failure of
China to broker an enduring solution, essentially cut out the Chinese by
directly negotiating the Leap Day deal of 2012. The arrangement did not
survive two months, but China did not regain its position at the center
of global efforts to deal with Pyongyang.

It is true that American officials still troop to Beijing to talk about
North Korea, as Secretaries Hagel and Kerry did this year, but their
efforts are going nowhere. So China's influence is not recovering. It is
natural for Beijing to try to restart the discussions that would restore
its prominence---and its leverage over Pyongyang---but its efforts look
half-hearted, perhaps because Chinese diplomats understand that they
have missed the moment to put their stamp on the peninsula. In China's
case, repeated failure to move the Kim regime toward disarmament has led
to a general loss of influence.

[Fourth, the rise of Korean nationalism diminishes the standing of
outsiders. Nationalism seems on the upswing in the North as the regime
seeks to bolster faltering legitimacy.]{.underline} In the South, it may
not be as evident today as it was during the administrations of Kim
Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, but it remains the dominant force on the
peninsula, always present and always strong. How could it be otherwise
in a land colonized for four decades and then divided into two to this
day?

#### North Korea doesn't pose great risk to existence.

**Reiter 18** (Dan Reiter, 5-24-2018, \"Analysis,\" Washington Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/11/should-you-worry-about-a-u-s-war-with-north-korea-not-really/?noredirect=on>)

Though the powder keg image is powerful, in reality very few wars start
this way. [It's rare to see a minor incident like a border clash
escalating or a preemptive war break out because one side attacks out of
fear that the other side is about to attack.]{.underline}

About 20 years ago, I wrote that since 1816, [preemptive wars have
almost never
happened](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539227?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
Further, many dangerous international crises --- like the [Berlin
Crisis](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/berlin-crises) in
1958-1961 or the October 1962 [Cuban missile
crisis](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/cuban-missile-crisis) ---
did not escalate into preemptive wars.

More recently, the 1994 scare over a second Iraqi invasion of Kuwait did
not prompt U.S. preemption. Chinese missile tests off the coast of
Taiwan in 1996 did not spark war. And Russia's recent [provocative
aerial and naval actions against other
nations](https://www.iiss.org/en/about%20us/press%20room/press/archive/2014-9797/november-5cb2/russias-provocative-actions-at-cold-war-levels-28cf) have
not frightened the targets of such actions into preemption.

Why don't preemptive wars happen? Simply, [preemptive wars just aren't
that tempting. Leaders usually subscribe to [Otto von Bismarck's
observation](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/preventive-wars-the-antithesis-realpolitik-13367) that
such wars amount to committing suicide out of fear of
death.]{.underline} Why cause the very thing you hope to avoid?

**Is a preemptive war over North Korea likely? Not really.**

[Strategic theory suggests that if you really think the adversary is
about to attack, and you really think there is an advantage to attacking
first, then preemptive war becomes more attractive. Happily, neither
condition exists between the United States and North Korea. Most
importantly, neither side is likely to preempt because neither side
really thinks the other will attack first.]{.underline}

[The U.S.-North Korean relationship is actually far more stable than
most people think]{.underline}. [Both sides understand]{.underline} that
there is a very wide, [bright line]{.underline} separating begrudgingly
acceptable behavior from truly unacceptable behavior --- the type of
actions that might justify escalation to war:

**Acceptable (if undesirable):** North Korean missile and nuclear tests,
U.S.-South Korean war games, espionage, minor military actions against
South Korea, limited naval clashes, tourist abuse, cyberattacks,
belligerent rhetoric and economic sanctions.

Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, "Nuclear Weapons Don't Matter But
Nuclear Hysteria Does", Foreign Affairs, Vol. 97, No. 6, 10/15/19,

HOW ABOUT PROLIFERATION AND TERRORISM?

Great powers are one thing, some might say, but rogue states or
terrorist groups are another. If they go nuclear, it's game over---which
is why any further proliferation must be prevented by all possible
measures, up to and including war.

That logic might seem plausible at first, but it breaks down on close
examination. Not only has the world already survived the acquisition of
nuclear weapons by some of the craziest mass murderers in history
(Stalin and Mao), but [proliferation has slowed down rather than sped up
over time]{.underline}. Dozens of technologically sophisticated
countries have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, but very few have
done so. This is because [nuclear weapons turn out to be difficult and
expensive to acquire and strategically provocative to
possess]{.underline}.

They have not even proved to enhance status much, as many expected they
would. Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today than they
would without nukes, but would Japan's prestige be increased if it
became nuclear? Did China's status improve when it went nuclear---or
when its economy grew? And would anybody really care (or even notice) if
the current British or French nuclear arsenal was doubled or halved?

[Alarmists have misjudged not only the pace of proliferation but also
its effects. Proliferation is incredibly dangerous and necessary to
prevent, we are told, because going nuclear would supposedly empower
rogue states and lead them to dominate their region.]{.underline} The
details of how this domination would happen are rarely discussed, but
the general idea seems to be that once a country has nuclear weapons, it
can use them to threaten others and get its way, with nonnuclear
countries deferring or paying ransom to the local bully out of fear.

Except, of course, that in three-quarters of a century, the United
States has never been able to get anything close to that obedience from
anybody, even when it had a nuclear monopoly. So why should it be true
for, say, Iran or North Korea? It is far more likely that a nuclear
rogue's threats would cause its rivals to join together against the
provocateur---just as countries around the Persian Gulf responded to
Saddam's invasion of Kuwait by closing ranks to oppose, rather than
acquiescing in, his effort at domination.

If the consequences of proliferation have so far proved largely benign,
however, the same cannot be said for efforts to control it. During the
2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois
repeatedly proclaimed his commitment to "do everything in \[his\] power
to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon--- everything," and his
opponent, the Republican senator from Arizona John McCain, insisted that
Iran must be kept from obtaining a nuclear weapon "at all costs."
Neither bothered to tally up what "everything" entailed or what the
eventual price tag of "all costs" would be. All they needed to do was
consider the fate of one country to understand the potentially
disastrous consequences of such thinking. [The Iraq war had been sold as
an act of preventive counterproliferation, with President George W. Bush
pointedly warning that "the United States of America will not permit the
world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most
destructive weapons." A nuclear Iraq was considered unacceptable because
it would "hold \[its\] neighbors hostage." Put aside for a moment the
fact that Saddam had actually mothballed his covert weapons of mass
destruction programs years earlier, so that the war turned out to be
unnecessary by its own rationale.]{.underline} Imagine that Saddam, with
his resentful population and unreliable army, had managed to acquire a
modest nuclear capability. What would have happened then? What could and
would he have done with the weapons? Something worse than launching the
war to prevent Iraq from going nuclear, which, along with its aftermath,
has killed hundreds of thousands of people and destabilized an entire
region?

[As for nuclear terrorism]{.underline}, [ever since al Qaeda operatives
used box cutters so effectively to hijack commercial airplanes,
alarmists have warned that radical Islamist terrorists would soon apply
equal talents in science and engineering to make and deliver nuclear
weapons so as to destroy various socalled infidels]{.underline}. In
practice, however, terrorist groups have exhibited only a limited desire
to go nuclear and even less progress in doing so. Why? Probably because
developing one's own bomb from scratch requires a series of risky
actions, all of which have to go right for the scheme to work. This
includes trusting foreign collaborators and other criminals; acquiring
and transporting highly guarded fissile material; establishing a
sophisticated, professional machine shop; and moving a cumbersome,
untested weapon into position for detonation. And all of this has to be
done while hiding from a vast global surveillance net looking for and
trying to disrupt such activities.

[Terrorists are unlikely to get a bomb from a generous, like-minded
nuclear patron, because no country wants to run the risk of being blamed
(and punished) for a terrorist's nuclear crimes.]{.underline} Nor are
they likely to be able to steal one. Notes Stephen Younger, the former
head of nuclear weapons research and development at Los Alamos National
Laboratory: "All nuclear nations take the security of their weapons very
seriously."

The grand mistake of the Cold War was to infer desperate intent from
apparent capacity. For the war on terrorism, it has been to infer
desperate capacity from apparent intent.

DON'T DO STUPID STUFF

For nearly three-quarters of century, the world has been told it is
perched precariously on Rube Goldberg's precipice, perennially at risk
of plunging into apocalyptic devastation. But oddly enough, both we and
the weapons are still here. Understanding their actual impact and
putting them into the proper context would enable policymakers to view
nuclear matters more sensibly.

In practice, that would mean retaining the capabilities needed to
respond to the wildly unlikely nightmare scenario of having to deter a
possible future Hitler while pruning nuclear arsenals and stepping back
from dangerous strategies and postures. It would mean working with North
Korea to establish a normal condition in the region and worrying about
reducing its nuclear capabilities later. There is nothing wrong with
making nonproliferation a high priority---indeed, it would do a favor to
countries dissuaded from pursuing nuclear weapons by saving them a lot
of money and pointless effort. However, that priority should be topped
by a somewhat higher one: avoiding policies that can lead to massive
numbers of deaths under the obsessive sway of worst-case fantasies.∂

BREMEN, Germany --- [The administrator of NASA and his Chinese
counterpart have both expressed interest in working together despite the
current constraints in U.S. law regarding bilateral
cooperation.]{.underline}

During a panel discussion at the 69th International Astronautical
Conference here Oct. 1 featuring the leaders of several space agencies,
Zhang Kejian, administrator of the China National Space Administration
(CNSA), said China was open to working with a wide range of
international partners on projects ranging from lunar exploration to its
future space station.

"CNSA is willing to join our hands with other international partners for
the benefit of human civilization and progress of human society," Zhang
said, speaking through a translator.

Asked later if that included working with NASA, he said China was "very
open" to working with a variety of international partners on lunar
exploration. He noted he met with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine
earlier in the day. "I had a very good discussion with NASA
Administrator Mr. Bridenstine for bilateral cooperation in this
particular area," he said. "I think the response was very positive."

[Bridenstine]{.underline}, appearing on the same panel, [noted that
there is some cooperation with China today in areas such as aeronautics
and Earth science. That cooperation takes place despite the presence of
language in appropriations laws colloquially known as the Wolf
Amendment]{.underline}, after former Rep. Frank Wolf, who first included
it in spending bills several years ago. That provision prohibits
bilateral cooperation between NASA and Chinese agencies without prior
congressional approval.

["We do cooperate in a lot of ways,]{.underline} but that doesn't mean
our interests are always aligned," he said. "Some of these decisions are
going to be made above the pay grade of the NASA administrator."

["To the extent that agencies and countries from around the world can
cooperate on space, it is absolutely in our interest to do so," he
added. "I look forward to exploring more opportunities to do
that."]{.underline}

"I believe that the working teams of both sides can start preparation of
a cooperation list," Zhang responded. "We can dash out those that cannot
be implemented now, or are above our pay grade, and then we can start
cooperating on the substantial part." That included, he added, exchange
of scientific data and space situational awareness information.

At a press conference held after the panel, [Bridenstine agreed that a
greater sharing of data was one area of potential enhanced cooperation
with China. "They're doing some amazing scientific experiments," he
said, citing as an example China's upcoming Chang'e-4
mission]{.underline} that will attempt the first landing on the far side
of the moon. "[We can share data and collaborate that way so that each
country can learn more about science."]{.underline}

[He also agreed that sharing space situational awareness and space
traffic management information may be another area of
cooperation.]{.underline} "There is no issue related to space more
important to for all of us to get right than that issue," he said. "[We
need to preserve the space environment for generations to come. The only
way we're going to be able to do that internationally is to
collaborate."]{.underline}

Those initiatives, he suggested, [could open the door to more ambitious
joint efforts. "This could be the first confidence-building measure that
is necessary to establish the kind of relationship that is necessary to
go to the next step,"]{.underline} he said.

Bridenstine added, though, that was unlikely that the Wolf Amendment,
renewed on an annual basis through new spending bills, would go away in
the near future, thus creating barriers to closer cooperation. "If there
comes a day when we can cooperate, that provision would simply expire
and we would be able to cooperate," he said.

And when could that happen? "That would be up to the United States
Congress based on the information they're seeing and the intelligence
that they receive."

#### US- China co-op in space possible---Russia proves.

"There is not a lot of dialogue between the U.S. and China,\" Weeden
said.

But other space experts say [China is a greater threat to the United
States than most people realize]{.underline} --- and even an "imminent
threat," independent analyst Namrata Goswami said.

"If anything, \[the threat from China\] is under-appreciated and
underplayed in the U.S.," she said. "I suspect that is because the U.S.
military might not want to call attention to its own vulnerabilities
regarding its space assets."

[Qiao said China is not seeking a space war. But he said it is preparing
to counter any nation, including the U.S., that seeks to pose a threat
to China\'s national security.]{.underline}

Qiao said China's economic prowess leaves it well positioned to prevail
in an expensive contest with the U.S.

\"When the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in the Cold War
and the arms race, the United States was the largest manufacturing
country, and the Soviet Union was not even the second," he said. \"But
today it is China who is the world\'s top manufacturer.\"

Recent reports from U.S. spy agencies and think tanks indicate that
[China\'s efforts are advancing quickly]{.underline}. [Those include
estimates that China will soon be able to field high-powered lasers
designed to attack objects in low-Earth orbit --- and evidence that
Chinese weapons can already attack targets much farther from the Earth
than the United States can.]{.underline}

[China's reliance on space assets is also expanding: It has more than
120 intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites of its own
--- a number second only to the United State]{.underline}s. About half
of those assets owned and operated by the Chinese military and could be
used to track and target U.S. forces around the world, the report warns.

[The threat getting the most attention is the danger China's orbiting
weapons might pose to the satellites the United States]{.underline}
relies on for communications, navigation and surveillance --- for both
military operations and economic well-being.

[China is heavily investing in so-called counterspace technology,
including the development of at least three antisatellite missile
systems,]{.underline} according to an April report from the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. It is also developing satellites
that touch other satellites in orbit, the report said. While that
technology can be used for repairs in orbit, it can also be used to
disable a satellite or tear off a solar array to affect a satellite's
power source.

The Pentagon's China Military Power report found that China is also
pursuing new jamming and "directed energy" weapons that can interfere
with satellites. In a conflict[, that technology would probably be used
to "blind and deafen the enemy]{.underline}," the report said.

China also reorganized the People's Liberation Army in 2015 to create a
Strategic Support Force, a military branch dedicated entirely to space,
electronic and cyber warfare. The new branch was designed to bring space
assets from across the Chinese military under one organization, similar
to the goal of the U.S. Space Force.

The space-centric branch, which reports directly to the Central Military
Commission, is focused primarily on satellite launches and intelligence,
navigation and communication operations, but also conducts research and
development on new counterspace capabilities, according to a Defense
Intelligence agency report published in February.

Chinese military units are also training with missiles that could damage
or destroy satellites, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported in
February. And they will probably have a ground-based laser that can
blind optical sensors on satellites in low-Earth orbit by 2020.

[Unlike the United States or Russia, China is also believed to have the
capacity to use missiles to attack satellites in the more distant
geosynchronous orbit, or 22,000 miles above Earth.]{.underline}

If any country were to launch a kinetic strike in geosynchronous orbit,
the debris field would make the area, which is today used for critical
missions like early missile warning and weather observations, unusable.

"We have much more to lose in GEO than any other country," said Kaitlyn
Johnson, an associate fellow who specializes in space security at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. "We wouldn't want to
have a first strike capability."

Military experts also worry that China could try to seize areas of the
moon that contain strategic resources including ice that could be used
for rocket fuel or life support.

But they say it's much more likely China would want to use dominance in
space to influence conflicts on Earth. Being able to threaten the
military's GPS or communications satellites might deter the U.S. from
getting involved in a conflict in the South China Sea, Weeden said.

The U.S. Space Force is intended to close some of those gaps by grouping
space troops together to build expertise and giving the new service
autonomy over its budget requests. One of the biggest goals of the new
branch is to speed up space acquisition, allowing new technology to be
fielded faster, and to develop a space "doctrine" that would oversee how
the U.S. fights conflicts when space platforms are at stake.

[The Chinese government insists that it is]{.underline} merely
[responding to aggressive U.S. moves to dominate space militarily. And
Qiao called it "bullying and hegemonic" for the United States to insist
that other countries can't follow suit.]{.underline}

\"The U.S. space troops have long existed,\" Qiao said. \"They just did
not become an independent force. \... Moreover, the U.S. possessed
anti-satellite capabilities as early as the 1970s and 1980s. China only
developed anti-satellite capabilities by the end of the 1990s and even
in the first decade of this century.\"

He insisted that China has little choice but to enhance its own
capabilities.

\"China's purpose to develop space capabilities, firstly, is we do not
want to be blackmailed by others,\" Qiao maintained in the interview.
\"Second, we hope to use space peacefully. But if others want to oppress
us by occupying the heights of space and opening up a \'fourth
battlefield\' China will certainly not accept it.\"

Still, [China remains far from overcoming American
dominance]{.underline}, Qiao said. \"We [cannot surpass the U.S. in the
next decade or two]{.underline}, but we will narrow the gap in a
comprehensive way," he said. "And it is possible to we may take the lead
in some individual areas."

Weeden agreed.

"China is developing many of the same space capabilities the U.S. did
decades ago, while the U.S. is focused on sustaining its capabilities
and making them more resilient," he said. "On the whole, the U.S. is
still far more capable than China is but the relative advantage is
narrowing."

The two nations have some diplomatic channels through which they could
cooperate in space, including the United Nations' Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, of which both the U.S. and China are
members. In 2015, the Obama administration also established a dialogue
with China on space safety, which is quietly continuing under Trump,
although the meetings are mostly high-level talks, Weeden said.

[But the Wolf Amendment, which was first passed in an appropriations
bill in 2011, forbids the U.S. government from working with China and
prohibits any bilateral cooperation between the China National Space
Administration and NASA on national security grounds. And there's
virtually no collaboration between the militaries of the two nations
today.]{.underline}

[To open the door for conversations that could ease tensions and avoid
miscommunication, the U.S. and China must "crawl before we
walk,"]{.underline} Audrey Schaffer, the director of space strategy and
plans at the Defense Department, said at a March event on U.S.-China
space relations hosted by the Secure World Foundation.

[Some potential first steps include the two countries sharing
information like their national defense strategies, providing launch
notifications of space vehicles or opening routine, secure
communications channels between U.S. and Chinese diplomats. Each step
would help build trust and transparency, Schaffer said, and pointed to
the strong relationship between the U.S. and Russia in space as evidence
that it can be done.]{.underline}

"[Even then when the relationship was just as strained, if not more so,
we did manage to work bilaterally and multilaterally with the Soviets to
really create mechanisms that would help reduce the risks of conflict
and enhance stability," Schaffer said]{.underline}

Military Strategy [When it comes to mutual strategic distrust, the
military/security sphere is both important and pernicious]{.underline}.
We [therefore focus]{.underline} especially [on ideas to reduce distrust
in this realm]{.underline}. Strategic postures The United States and
China are now making significant decisions regarding both doctrine and
investments in military capability. Broadly, the U.S. is reducing
anticipated military expenditures and at the same time reconfiguring
forces to assure that American goals in the Asia-Pacific can be met.
China is in the midst of a significant buildup of its military
capabilities to be commensurate with its increasing regional and global
activities and interests. Their respective efforts are likely to
contribute to increased strategic mistrust unless the two sides address
a central question: what array of military deployments and normal
operations will permit China to defend its core security interests and
at the same time allow America to continue to meet fully its obligations
to its allies and friends in the region? The answer will not be
completely comfortable for either side---China's military is already
developing capabilities to force changes in American platforms and
plans, and Beijing cannot realistically hope to achieve the capacity to
dominate the surrounding seas out to the first island chain against
determined American efforts to prevent that domination. As of now, [each
side is developing doctrines that are ill-understood by the
other]{.underline}---China talks about securing the near seas and the
U.S. talks in terms of an Air-Sea Battle doctrine that is now evolving
into a Joint Operational Access Concept (JOAC). [These doctrines both
reflect and shape threat perceptions]{.underline}. Almost unique to the
military sphere, moreover, is that decisions are made in anticipation of
requirements 10-20 years from now, as it generally takes that long to
move from initial agreement to develop a major new weapons system to
integration of the actual system into combat capability and doctrine.
Each side, in addition, as best it can monitors the decisions the other
side is making about this long-term future and reacts accordingly. While
the specific concerns and operational assumptions behind each doctrine
are opaque, each is increasingly being couched in terms that can easily
justify escalating military expenditures as both militaries attempt to
achieve basically unattainable levels of certainty. U.S. analysis
regards China as having adopted an anti-access and area denial strategy,
but many details about Chinese aspirations are very unclear. The Chinese
side is anxious over its lack of understanding of either the Air Sea
Battle Concept or the new JOAC. There is, therefore, now a pressing need
for a serious discussion of the respective doctrines and their
relationship to various decisions about deployment of military
capabilities as pertains to Asia. This cries out for top political
leaders to step in and, along with their militaries, discuss principles
and accommodations that give each side reasonable certainty about its
core interests through a set of understandings and agreements that
include steps embodying mutual restraint on development and deployment
of particularly destabilizing weapons systems and platforms. Such
discussions also need to probe each side's goals and expectations on
such sensitive issues as the Korean peninsula and Taiwan in order to
improve mutual understanding and build greater trust. Specifically, such
discussions might fruitfully address: [Mutual restraint on new
capabilities:]{.underline} This is a particularly important topic
[because many capabilities are being developed in direct response to
what the other side is doing. Demonstration of the viability of
commitments to mutual restraint may in turn increase mutual
trust]{.underline}. The history of international arms control agreements
highlights that this is an area worth pursuing. [Anticipating future
possibilities in Korea:]{.underline} Mutual discussion [of potential
long-term futures for the Korean peninsula can elucidate each others'
goals and possibly engender new ideas about how to achieve mutually
agreed upon outcomes. Even the process of holding such discussions may
create better mutual understanding and reduce the bases for strategic
distrust.]{.underline} This is not a suggestion to try to develop a
U.S.-China agreement that can be used to dictate to the governments in
North and South Korea or to impinge upon their sovereign rights, which
is not a feasible or desirable objective. [Reducing distrust over
Taiwan]{.underline}: Both sides want to work toward a peaceful
resolution of existing differences between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait. U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan are viewed in Washington and Taipei
as a necessary ingredient for sustaining the confidence of U.S. support
in Taipei necessary for Taipei to continue to develop wide ranging
cross-Strait relations. Those same sales in Beijing are viewed as
confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere in China's
domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from occurring,
thereby harming a clearly-articulated interest. Washington and Beijing
should engage in serious discussion of the overall security situation
surrounding the Taiwan Strait. [Lack of such discussion has contributed
to having each side make worst case assumptions in their acquisition and
deployment of military resources, enhancing mutual distrust]{.underline}
and ultimately potentially reducing the chances of maintaining the peace
in the Taiwan Strait that both sides desire. Maritime security:
[Maritime security discussions already take place and have produced a
U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, but there remains
significant room for expansion and enhancement of those
discussion]{.underline}s.8 It is worth considering whether [there are
steps that might address U.S. security concerns in a way that reduces
Washington's perceived need to conduct reconnaissance and intelligence
activities]{.underline} just beyond China's territorial waters and air
space. [Nuclear modernization and militarization of outer
spac]{.underline}e: Each of these spheres [exhibits all of the
characteristics of a classic security dilemma, where measures taken to
enhance defensive capabilities by one side are seen as threatening and
requiring commensurate measures by the other. These are spheres in which
greater mutual transparency, potential agreements on specific areas of
mutual restraint, and deeper understanding of respective concerns and
doctrines can potentially reduce the chances of destabilizing changes
occurring in these technologically dynamic realms.]{.underline}

### 2nc -- at -- wolf amendment key

#### Wolf Amendment useless\-\--US to cooperate instead of compete with China.

**Foust 6/3** (Jeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space,
and related topics for *SpaceNews*. He earned a Ph.D. in planetary
sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor's
degree with honors in geophysics and planetary science from the
California Institute of Technology.,, 6-3-2019, \"The Space Review:
Defanging the Wolf Amendment,\" No Publication,
<http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3725>)

There's also the question of whether the Wolf Amendment has been
effective at all in changing Chinese behavior, either in space or on
Earth. That was the point raised by Todd Harrison, director of the
Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, during [an April 25 hearing on China's space
activities](https://www.uscc.gov/Hearings/china-space-strategic-competition) by
the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.

"[Our policy of excluding China]{.underline} from human spaceflight and
exploration missions to the Moon and beyond [has not slowed its rise as
a space power,"]{.underline} he said. ["Worse, it may create an
incentive for China to build an alternative coalition for space
exploration that could undermine our traditional leadership role in this
arena."]{.underline}

He specifically brought up the Wolf Amendment later in the hearing.
"[The Wolf Amendment]{.underline}, I believe, [has largely proven
ineffective in what it is was trying to do. It's not slowing China
down]{.underline}," he said. "I think that we ought to look at [not only
repeal]{.underline}ing that, [but looking at areas where we can engage
China in civil space missions]{.underline}."

Repealing the amendment, though, wouldn't mean eliminating all
conditions on US-China space cooperation, he continued, arguing that any
cooperation should avoid the exchange of technology and "not alienate
any of our existing partners in space," such as those on the ISS. (Many
of those partners, like Europe, are already engaging with China to a
greater degree than the US is today.)

"I think in many places[, in terms of space exploration, we do have
compatible missions where we want to go to the Moon]{.underline}. We
want to explore different parts of the moon," he said. "There's no
reason [we could]{.underline} not [do that in conjunction with them and
prevent some of the worst-case scenarios that have been talked about
here of China potentially getting there first and claiming territory or
rights or excluding others]{.underline}."

But the debate about the Wolf Amendment raises a more fundamental
question: does the US want to cooperate with China in space exploration,
and vice versa?

At last October's International Astronautical Congress (IAC), the two
countries appeared willing to at least examine it. NASA administrator
Jim Bridenstine met with his Chinese counterpart, CNSA administrator
Zhang Kejian, and the two appeared on a panel session along with the
heads of several other space agencies. ["I had a very good discussion
with NASA Administrator Mr. Bridenstine for bilateral cooperation in
this particular area,]{.underline}" Zhang said of lunar exploration in
particular.

"[We do cooperate in a lot of ways,]{.underline} but that doesn't mean
our interests are always aligned," Bridenstine said. "Some of these
decisions are going to be made above the pay grade of the NASA
administrator."

"I believe that the working teams of both sides can start preparation of
a cooperation list," Zhang responded. "We can dash out those that cannot
be implemented now, or are above our pay grade, and then we can start
cooperating on the substantial part."

  ----------------------------
  **"My central recommendation
  for this commission, and for
  Congress, is that we need to
  rethink our approach to
  China when it comes to
  space. We need a
  multifaceted approach that
  simultaneously engages and
  deters," Harrison said.**
  ----------------------------

  ----------------------------

At a later press conference at the IAC, Bridenstine suggested potential
cooperation with China in areas like lunar exploration and space traffic
management. This could be the first confidence-building measure that is
necessary to establish the kind of relationship that is necessary to go
to the next step," he said.

By earlier this year, though, Bridenstine didn't seem nearly as eager to
pursue cooperation with China. "I'm not going to close that door," he
said of potential bilateral or multilateral cooperation in space
exploration involving China during a February media roundtable, "but
certainly it's not a door I'm opening wide."

NASA's current plans for lunar exploration appear to offer few, if any,
opportunities for working with China. The new sprint to the Moon,
landing humans at the south pole by 2024, will largely be a US-only
effort, with little role for any international cooperation beyond
existing agreements, like the European-built service module for Orion.
International contributions, such as modules for the lunar Gateway, will
mostly be deferred to post-2024 efforts to make that presence on the
Moon more sustainable.

China has its own modest international partnerships for its robotic
lunar exploration program, flying instruments from several countries on
the Chang'e-4 mission. It's also expressed an openness to flying
payloads, and even astronauts, from other countries on the space station
it plans to construct in low Earth orbit over the next several years,
although how that might extend to Chinese human missions to the
Moon---whenever those take place---isn't clear.

For now, though, there seems to be little impetus from NASA or the
administration to modify or remove the Wolf Amendment, and little
interest from the House, now in Democratic hands for the first time
since the amendment was first placed into an appropriations bill, to
change it. That may explain why it was retained in the latest CJS
appropriations bill, with members choosing to focus their attention on
other, higher priority issues.

But experts like Harrison think the overall approach the US takes to
working with, or competing against, China in space needs to be
reconsidered. That April commission meeting focused more broadly on
Chinese space activities, including the development of anti-satellite
weapons and other capabilities that could threaten American space
assets, particularly during a conflict involving the two nations.

"My central recommendation for this commission, and for Congress, is
that we need to rethink our approach to China when it comes to space.
[We need a multifaceted approach that simultaneously engages and
deters]{.underline}," Harrison said. "[We should engage China
proactively in civil space programs when we have shared goals and when
our intellectual property and existing space partnerships are adequately
protected]{.underline}." But, he added, "[as we engage China more openly
in civil space, we should simultaneously make a concerted effort to
improve our deterrence posture in national security space]{.underline}."

"[China is a rising space power," he concluded. "Our policies must
recognize this fact and adapt accordingly to protect our economic and
security interests in space."]{.underline}

#### Rise in bilateral space cooperation.

**Foust 6/3** (Jeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space,

Later this month the House of Representatives will start consideration
of appropriations bills for fiscal year 2020. Those bills will include
the commerce, justice, and science (CJS) bill, which the House
Appropriations Committee favorably reported May 22.

Tucked away near the end of [the 108-page
bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/FY2020%20CJS%20Sub%20Markup%20Draft.pdf) is
this provision:

SEC. 526. (a) None of the funds made available by this Act may be used
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Office
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), or the National Space Council
(NSC) to develop, design, plan, promulgate, implement, or execute a
bilateral policy, program, order, or contract of any kind to
participate, collaborate, or coordinate bilaterally in any way with
China or any Chinese-owned company unless such activities are
specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of enactment of
this Act.

\(b\) None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to
effectuate the hosting of official Chinese visitors at facilities
belonging to or utilized by NASA.

\(c\) The limitations described in subsections (a) and (b) shall not
apply to activities which NASA, OSTP, or NSC, after consultation with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have certified---\
(1) pose no risk of resulting in the transfer of technology, data, or
other information with national security or economic security
implications to China or a Chinese-owned company; and\
(2) will not involve knowing interactions with officials who have been
determined by the United States to have direct involvement with
violations of human rights.

\(d\) Any certification made under subsection (c) shall be submitted to
the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the
Senate, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, no later than 30 days
prior to the activity in question and shall include a description of the
purpose of the activity, its agenda, its major participants, and its
location and timing.

That section will look familiar to those who have scrutinized past
appropriations bills. Colloquially known as the [Wolf
Amendment]{.underline}, after former Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA), who added a
version of it to an appropriations bill eight years ago, it restricts
NASA's ability to cooperate directly with China on space exploration.
Some, though, think the provision has [outlived any
usefulness]{.underline} it might have once had.

  ----------------------------
  **"A lot of people think the
  Wolf Amendment is a
  prohibition on working with
  the Chinese. It's not," said
  Gold.**
  ----------------------------

  ----------------------------

"While it's probably a bridge too far to completely get rid of the Wolf
Amendment," said Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the
Secure World Foundation, "[it's]{.underline} probably [time
to]{.underline} think about how to relax it, or at least [prescribe
areas where we]{.underline} might [want to think about having
cooperation with China in space."]{.underline}

Weeden was speaking on a panel convened by the Secure World Foundation
in March [examining the state of US-China space
relations](https://swfound.org/events/2019/us-china-engagement-in-space).
That discussion inevitably led to a review of the Wolf Amendment and its
effectiveness.

Others on the panel pointed out that, contrary to many perceptions of
the provision, the Wolf Amendment does allow for cooperation, under some
conditions. "A lot of people think the Wolf Amendment is a prohibition
on working with the Chinese. It's not," noted Mike Gold, appearing on
the panel in his role as chair of the FAA's Commercial Space
Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC).

"It says that you can work with China, but you need certification from
the FBI---again totally warranted---and notification of Congress. Is
that a prohibition?" he asked. "To me, those are two common sense steps
right now. NASA can engage with China, has engaged with China under the
auspices of the Wolf Amendment."

That engagement, though, has been limited to areas like aviation and
Earth sciences. More recently, NASA and its Chinese counterpart, the
China National Space Administration (CNSA), held discussions to
coordinate observations of the landing site of China's Chang'e-4
spacecraft by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

  ----------------------------
  **"I absolutely agree that
  the Wolf Amendment does not
  prohibit cooperation, but
  the effect of it has been to
  prohibit it," Weeden said.**
  ----------------------------

  ----------------------------

"The types of coordination that were involved, there wasn't a formal
agreement," said Patrick Besha, senior policy advisor for strategic
engagement and assessment at NASA Headquarters, on the panel. "It was
more of, 'We are going to be orbiting around the same time that you'll
be landing. Is there something we could do?'"

He added that that coordination, while "reasonably successful," was
limited to just that mission, and went through the Congressional
notification and approval processes laid out in the Wolf Amendment.

Weeden argues that the amendment has a chilling effect on greater
cooperation, such as in human spaceflight. "I absolutely agree that the
[Wolf Amendment does not prohibit cooperation, but the effect of it has
been to prohibit it," he said. Agencies are reticent to ask permission,
and "the rhetoric from at least the last decade or so from many in
Congress on this has been extremely critical of any US agencies that
have tried to do engagement."]{.underline}

\"Preventing space war,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
<https://thebulletin.org/2009/01/preventing-space-war-2/>)

It's easy to see how a [similar treaty would work in space: With space
weapons outlawed]{.underline}, there can be no space-based weapons to
initiate space warfare. Better still, [space weapons, which are also
expensive and difficult to maintain in the harsh space environment,
generally travel in predictable orbits, are easily detectable from the
ground, and can be easily targeted.]{.underline}

The presence of [dual-use satellites presents a different problem, as
they're primarily commercial communication]{.underline} satellites on
which the military buys communication time to satisfy their very high
need for bandwidth. Commercial communication satellites [are
passive]{.underline}, which can be assured by pre-launch inspection, and
as such, [do not have an operational capacity to conduct bellicose
operations.]{.underline} In fact, an overwhelming amount of bandwidth
available to the military is via such quasi-secure and unhardened
commercial satellites. Other commercial satellites, to a lesser degree,
can provide reconnaissance support. Because these commercial passive
activities support military operations, like merchant vessels subject to
unrestricted surface and submarine attack, they can be construed as
being "combatants" and may be targeted in a space war, thereby widening
the conflict. This all the more underscores the need for a ban on space
warfare.

[Assuming that no sane state would want to launch a surprise attack that
will invite retaliation, an outer space treaty analogous to the ABM
Treaty would provide the additional advantage of protecting both
commercial and military passive space assets (used for reconnaissance,
intelligence, and communication) and would have an excellent chance of
being enforceable]{.underline}.

Naturally, [an implicit assumption in this argument is that the major
space powers don't want a strategic war any more than the United States
or Soviet Union did during the Cold War. This is a reasonable premise
since the major powers have the most to lose in a space war that will
all but end military, commercial, and environmental activities in space.
There are international political and legal precedents to build
on.]{.underline} For instance, Article IX of the U.N. Outer Space Treaty
offers historical and legitimate precedence for peaceful applications
that protect space activities. With appropriate and tangible incentives
such as sharing of space technologies, enhancing launch reliability, and
limiting orbital debris, a complete and robust extension of this treaty
should be achievable.

[Reconnaissance satellites]{.underline} were "instrumental in
transforming an area of competition into one of conflict management by
providing each side with a largely unilateral means of verifying the
behavior of the other," thus [supply]{.underline}ing [a viable way to
mitigate effects of the security dilemma]{.underline}.26 The United
States and the Soviet Union were aware of this and even agreed in [the
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I)]{.underline} to not attack the
others' "national technical means of verification" (NTMV).27 Therefore,
military space technology was crucial for de-escalating and regulating
the arms race that, for a time, had defined the Cold War, as "it was
only the ability to verify compliance that made the two sides willing to
sign such agreements." 28 Since the end of the Cold War,
**["reconnaissance satellites have served as a national technical means
of verification of international non-proliferation, arms control, and
disarmament regimes."]{.underline}** 29 [There are now "large
verification organizations," such as the "International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW), and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization
(CTBTO)."]{.underline} 30 Although processes of verification have
changed since the end of the Cold War, ["monitoring by satellite from
outer space" remains "one of the most useful remote monitoring
tools.]{.underline}" 31 "One of the major advantages of satellites is
that their use does not need permission of the state that is being
monitored"; this makes them particularly useful to monitor
non-transparent states that may pose national or global security
risks.32 In addition to being a useful asset for "detecting
non-compliant states and deterring potential non-compliers[," the
"verification system also plays the positive role of permitting
compliant parties to demonstrate their compliance," which creates
greater transparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs) between
states that are an imperative for sustained international
stability.]{.underline}33

Similarly, there is "the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space
(PAROS)," which is a "UN resolution seeking a ban on the weaponization
of space." 66 In 2008, "[China and Russia jointly submitted to the UN
Conference on Disarmament a draft Treaty on Prevention of the Placement
of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against
Outer Space Objects."]{.underline} 67 Revisions were made to the
original 2008 treaty and a new one was submitted in 2014; on both
occasions, **[the United States rejected]{.underline}** it. As the
United States ["refutes international restrictions and undercuts
potential international agreements," it appears that the United States
"undermines any potential initiatives put forth by the international
community to control space weaponization."]{.underline} 68 [The U.S.
position risks destabilizing international relations]{.underline}, as
certain scholars have argued that "[it would be unwise for any country
to seek space dominance, for quite practical and strategic
reasons,"]{.underline} since "there are many ways to attack space
assets, and it is easier and cheaper to attack than to defend them." 69
Shixiu suggests that [U.S]{.underline} security policy "poses a serious
threat to the national security of China," as it "[reinforces a
unilateral U.S. approach to space security which is compounded by the
U.S. opposition to any international treaties that limit its access to
or use of space.]{.underline}" 70 Without the right control of space
weaponry in place, military space technology stands to spiral out of
control and destabilize international relations. One method that the
United States can employ is to "attempt to discourage hostile actors
from attacking satellites by continuing to promote the international
norm that space should be preserved as a sanctuary from war." 71
Conversely, there is an inevitability argument surrounding space
weaponization, as certain academics argue that ["the weaponization of
space is unavoidable because of the military advantages that will
inevitably accrue to the state that is first to place weapons in
space."]{.underline} 72 Those who advocate that weaponization of outer
space is inevitable suggest that the United States should "arm itself
for offensive and defensive counterspace operations and, 58 G. SARIAK in
the event of war, protect its space assets by forcefully dominating the
medium in a fashion similar to the way it has in other domains." 73
Which strategy the U.S. implements is yet to be seen; however its
military space technology stands to destabilize international relations
regardless, as the "increased U.S. reliance on a satellite-support
infrastructure creates an incentive for other states to weaponize space
irrespective of whether the U.S. chooses to do so or not." 74 China is
