#### Trump's base support high but fragile due to failures on campaign promises -- base blame others for failures, but Trump action against their interests can lead to defections

**Ward 5/14** (Emily, White House reporter for the Washington Examiner,
2019, "Trump\'s base loyal despite border wall and Obamacare failures",
<https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/trumps-base-loyal-despite-border-wall-and-obamacare-failures>,

**[More than two years into his presidency, Trump has not delivered on
two of his biggest 2016 campaign promises: building a wall along the
U.S.-Mexico border and making Mexico pay for it, and repealing the
Affordable Care Act. But despite falling short, Trump's base is sticking
with him, and Republican strategists expect his supporters will remain
loyal in the upcoming election.\
An April Gallup poll showed an 89% overall approval rating for Trump
among Republicans, and results of a Washington Post-ABC News poll
published April 30 revealed that 74% of Republicans approve of Trump's
handling of immigration.\]{.underline}**
"They're pretty loyal to him. His base is pretty rock-solid," said
Republican strategist Glen Bolger. Former Trump campaign manager Corey
Lewandowski called Trump's base "exceptionally loyal."\
Others said Trump's base would understand that he has been constrained
by Congress, which has repeatedly blocked various aspects of Trump's
legislative agenda.\
"It won't hurt him in the least, because his supporters will blame other
people for the failure to accomplish those goals," said Republican
strategist Whit Ayres.\
In 2017, the Republican-controlled Senate could not muster enough votes
to repeal and replace Obamacare, though it did manage to repeal the
individual mandate, the part of the Affordable Care Act that required
Americans to buy health insurance. A December 2018 federal court ruling
declared the remainder of the ACA unconstitutional, but the law remains
in effect. Trump's Justice Department has sided with the federal judge
who made the ruling, arguing that Obamacare should be completely
invalidated.\
**["The president is acting within his executive powers, doing
everything that he can," said Kelly Sadler, spokeswoman for the
Trump-allied America First PAC. "We need our do-nothing Congress to come
forward and go to the negotiating table. There's only so much the
president can do by himself. I think his base understands
that."\]{.underline}**
On border security, Trump completely dropped his promise that Mexico
would pay for the wall and went to Congress for the money instead.
Democrats refused to give Trump the amount he requested, resulting in
the longest government shutdown in history.\
Despite the setbacks, however, Trump continued to insist the wall be
built, declaring a national emergency in February to redirect military
construction funds to the wall.\
So far, Trump has built only about 40 miles of what he has said will be
a 1,000-mile wall. The Department of Homeland Security has begun
construction on projects in California, Texas, and Arizona, however, and
said it expects to build more than 200 miles of wall using appropriated
funding. The Army Corps of Engineers told the president in April that
450 miles of barrier will be complete by the end of 2020, a fact his
supporters were quick to point out.\
"President Trump is unquestionably the biggest champion of border
security, and his supporters know he will never stop fighting," said a
senior campaign staffer. "No one doubts his sincerity and tireless
dedication to protecting public safety by enforcing our border and
enforcing immigration laws."\
Still, some Republicans criticized Trump for not doing enough to stem
the flow of immigration --- both illegal and legal. They said there are
other ways to stop immigration, besides a wall, that Trump has not fully
pursued, and that this could make him politically vulnerable.\
Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which seeks to limit immigration,
said the president has not done enough to pass mandatory E-Verify, which
would require U.S. employers to screen employees' work eligibility
through an electronic system.\
"He's not pushed it," Beck said. "The question is: How much the base
will notice he hasn't done it? And to the extent that they do notice,
people will be disappointed at his lack of effort in that regard."\
**[Beck said Trump definitely has room in the next year to "improve his
situation," and that the president's base would probably understand that
he got a late start on building the wall.]{.underline}**

#### Reducing arms sales would be a massive flip-flop as Trump's recent expansion of arms sales was exclusively to catalyze base support

**LaFranchi 5/13** (Howard, staff writer for the Christian Science
Monitor, 2019, "When Trump 'unsigned' arms treaty, it was about more
than guns",
<https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2019/0513/When-Trump-unsigned-arms-treaty-it-was-about-more-than-guns>,

**[When President Donald Trump recently withdrew the U.S. imprimatur
from the international Arms Trade Treaty -- flinging into a crowd of
National Rifle Association members the big Sharpie he'd just used to
sign his order -- the showmanship had no legal implications.\
But the dramatic gesture was filled with symbolic meaning.\
Mr. Trump said he was "unsigning" a document the United States had
negotiated with other members of the United Nations and which former
President Barack Obama signed in 2013.\]{.underline}**
Experts in international law noted, however, that the U.S. had never
ratified the treaty -- intended to set global standards for conventional
arms transfers and deny weapons to human-rights violators -- which had
lain forgotten in the Senate for years.\
In any case, they added, the signature of one president can't be revoked
by another.\
**[But the thick black signature the president showed his appreciative
audience was of course intended for a domestic political base.\
Legalisms aside, the image the base was being shown was of a leader
rejecting one effort after another by the international community to
constrain American power and reach into sovereign nations, including the
U.S., to limit individual freedoms.\]{.underline}**
The deeper meaning\
For many diplomats and experts in international affairs, however, Mr.
Trump's dramatic rejection of the Arms Trade Treaty, or ATT, symbolizes
something else entirely: It stands as further evidence of a U.S.
withdrawal from its global leadership role and from the post-World War
II notion that international cooperation does not limit America's power
and prosperity but enhances them.\
"The Arms Trade Treaty was never envisioned as a big game changer that
would suddenly regulate global arms exports or have a significant impact
on shipments of arms to questionable regimes," says Daniel Prins, chief
of the conventional arms branch of the U.N.'s Office of Disarmament
Affairs. "But like other advances in international law, it is an attempt
to build norms and standards that admit themselves into behaviors of
countries and over time enhance those countries' security and
well-being."\
More broadly, Mr. Trump's move is another example of a global turn to a
heightened sense of sovereignty and nationalist focus at a moment when
the world faces a growing plate of issues, from climate change and
biodiversity loss to conflict-driven migration and terrorism,
international experts say. Such challenges can't be addressed
effectively by countries acting alone, they add, but demand multilateral
cooperation.\
Mr. Prins notes that the ATT, for the first time in an international
treaty, draws a direct connection between the global arms trade and
protection of human rights. He cites that as an "advance" in
international law, not just for populations facing repression, but also
for powers like the U.S. that have an interest in seeing human rights
protected.\
"Setting norms and standards of behavior doesn't detract from anyone but
actually enhances the position of those who were already upholding high
standards," says Mr. Prins, who was closely involved in the ATT's
negotiation and now assists in its implementation.\
"So in this case, if the Arms Trade Treaty can help stop rogue regimes
from shopping around for weapons," he adds, "it becomes a benefit to
arms exporters that already had the highest standards against supplying
such regimes."\
'Never surrender' sovereignty\
**[In announcing his rejection of the ATT at the NRA's national
convention April 26, Mr. Trump labeled the treaty a threat to Second
Amendment rights and an abdication of American power. "We will never
surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global
bureaucracy," the president said to cheers.\]{.underline}**
Accompanying Mr. Trump's announcement was a White House statement
calling the ATT unnecessary for the U.S. and a boon to unscrupulous arms
exporters.\
**["The ATT is simply not needed for the United States to engage in
responsible arms trade," the statement said. "America will continue to
abide by United States laws that ensure our arms sales are implemented
after careful legal and policy reviews."]{.underline}**

#### Losing the base causes Trump to lash out with nukes

Tim **Street 16**, Fellow of the Sustainable Security Programme at the
Oxford Research Group, previously researcher with the British American
Security Information Council, Ph.D. from Warwick University, 11/30/16,

**[Donald Trump's arrival in the White House as US President has deeply
unnerved people from across the political spectrum, both inside the US
and around the world]{.underline}**. The fact that many regard Trump as
an indecent individual and his government as potentially the number one
threat to their dignity, liberty and life means that the civil strife
already raging in the US is unlikely to fade away soon. The wide-ranging
**[implications of Trump's election]{.underline}** to the most powerful
office on Earth---**[for the peace and stability of]{.underline}** both
that nation and **[the world]{.underline}**---**[cannot be emphasised
enough]{.underline}**. In this regard, **[of the many
uncertainties]{.underline}** and worries **[brought on by a Trump
presidency, the]{.underline}** two **[existential questions
of]{.underline}** climate change and **[nuclear war stand
out]{.underline}**. With the former, **[Trump's recent comment that he
now has an 'open mind' about the importance of the Paris climate
agreement---having previously said climate change is a 'hoax'---is
unlikely to assuage fears that he will seek to dramatically expand the
US's extraction and reliance on fossil fuels]{.underline}**. With the
latter, strong doubts have been raised over whether the new President is
capable of responsibly handling the incredible power that will be at his
fingertips. Moreover, **[several commentators are already raising
concerns that]{.underline}** **[a Trump administration will pursue
policies that will aggravate and disappoint his supporters, a situation
that could increase the possibility of the US engaging in a
'diversionary' war]{.underline}**. In order to consider what we can
expect from a Trump presidency, as well as noting whom Trump empowers as
members of his cabinet and those whom he draws on for advice, it is
vital to study the track record of recent administrations and appreciate
the powers Trump will inherit. In doing so this briefing focuses on the
question of what a Trump presidency might mean for international
relations with a focus on nuclear arms, including doctrine and
disarmament. This means reviewing policies relevant to the US's nuclear
arsenal and pressing international challenges such as non-proliferation,
including in East Asia and the Middle East, as well as the US's
relationship with Russia and its role in NATO. The power and
responsibilities of the nuclear monarch **[The US President is solely
responsible for the decision to use the]{.underline}**
near-**[unimaginably destructive power of the nation's nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}**. Thus, as Bruce Blair---a former intercontinental
ballistic missile launch control officer---makes clear, '**[Trump will
have the sole authority to launch nuclear weapons whenever he
chooses]{.underline}** with a single phone call.' The wider political
meaning of the bomb for the world is aptly summarised by Daniel Deudney,
who describes nuclear weapons as 'intrinsically despotic' so that they
have created 'nuclear monarchies' in all nuclear-armed states. Deudney
identifies three related reasons for this development: 'the speed of
nuclear use decisions; the concentration of nuclear use decision into
the hands of one individual; and the lack of accountability stemming
from the inability of affected groups to have their interests
represented at the moment of nuclear use'. Similarly, Elaine Scarry has
explained in stark terms in her 2014 book Thermonuclear Monarchy:
Choosing between Democracy and Doom, how the possession of nuclear
weapons has converted the US government into 'a monarchic form of rule
that places all defense in the executive branch of government' leaving
the population 'incapacitated'. In response to this situation, Scarry
argues that the American people must use the Constitution as a tool to
dismantle the US nuclear weapons system, thereby revitalising democratic
participation and control over decision-making. Scarry also outlines the
incredible might the president wields, **[with each of the US's fourteen
nuclear-armed submarines alone carrying 'enough power to destroy the
people of an entire continent']{.underline}**, equivalent to 'eight
times the full-blast power expended by Allied and Axis countries in
World War II'. Nuclear specialist Hans Kristensen has described how the
US's strategic nuclear war plan 'if unleashed in its full capacity'
could 'kill hundreds of millions of people, devastate entire nations,
and cause climatic effects on a global scale'. This war plan consists of
a 'family of plans' that is aimed at 'six potential adversaries' whose
identities are kept secret. Kristensen understands that they include
'potentially hostile countries with nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons (WMD)', meaning China, North Korea, Iran, Russia and Syria as
well as a terrorist group backed by a state that has conducted a
catastrophic WMD attack. The 'dominant mission' for US nuclear weapons
within these plans is termed counterforce, meaning strikes on 'military,
mostly nuclear, targets and the enemy's leadership'. Despite these
plans, the US's nuclear arsenal is often described by mainstream
commentators as being solely intended to ensure mutual assured
destruction (MAD), i.e. as part of the 'balance of terror' with Russia,
in order to prevent armed conflict between the two nations and to ensure
a response in kind to a surprise nuclear attack. However, as Joseph
Gerson and John Feffer explain, rather than deterrence just being about
enough nuclear forces surviving a surprise first strike attack to ensure
MAD, US military planners have also understood it to mean 'preventing
other nations from taking "courses of action" that are inimical to US
interests'. David McDonough thus describes the 'long-standing goal of
American nuclear war-planners' as being the achievement of the ability
to launch a disarming first-strike against an opponent- otherwise known
as nuclear superiority. This has been magnified in recent years as the
US seeks to 'prevent' or 'rollback' the ability of weaker states---both
nuclear and non-nuclear powers---to establish or maintain a deterrence
relationship. Taking all this into account, the new commander-in-chief's
apparently volatile temperament thus raises deep concerns since his
finger will be on the nuclear trigger as soon as he assumes office on
20th January 2017. Given his past experience, Bruce Blair's statement
that he is 'scared to death' by the idea of a Trump presidency is but
one further reason why urgent discussion and action, both in the US and
globally, on lessening nuclear dangers---and reviving disarmament---is
vital. A recent report by the Ploughshares Fund on how the US can reduce
its nuclear spending, reform its nuclear posture and restrain its
nuclear war plans should thus be required reading in Washington.
However, as the Economist has rightly noted, 'It is not Mr Trump's fault
that the system, in which the vulnerable land-based missile force is
kept on hair-trigger alert, is widely held to be inherently dangerous'
since, as they point out, 'no former president, including Barack Obama,
has done anything to change it.' Over sixty years after the nuclear
attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclearism thus remains very much
embedded in the nation's strategic thinking. Yet the election of Obama,
and the rhetoric of his 2009 Prague speech, in which he stated
'America\'s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without
nuclear weapons' led many to think that a real change was on the cards.
Obama's visit to Hiroshima earlier this year to commemorate the bombings
was thus a painful reminder of how wide the gap is between the
rearmament programmes that the US and other nuclear weapon states are
engaged in and the disarmament action that they are legally obliged to
pursue under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Obama himself
said in Japan that, 'technological progress without an equivalent
progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution
that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as
well.' For this statement to be meaningful it is necessary to identify
who is responsible for the existing, highly dangerous state of affairs.
In short, the US government's recent record supports Scarry's suggestion
that a democratic revolution is what, in reality, is most needed if the
US is to make substantial progress on nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament. Short-term reforms towards the democratic control and
ultimate dismantlement of the US's nuclear arsenal have been outlined by
Kennette Benedict, who writes that the next administration should: place
our nuclear weapons on a much lower level of launch readiness, release
to the public more information about the nuclear weapons in our own
arsenals, include legislators and outside experts in its nuclear posture
review and recognize Congress' authority to declare war as a
prerequisite to any use of nuclear weapons. Assessing Obama's nuclear
legacy In order to properly appreciate what a Trump presidency may
bring, we need to revisit the range and types of powers bequeathed to
the commander-in-chief by previous administrations. Despite the military
advances made by China and Russia in recent years, it is important to
recognise that the US remains far and away the biggest global spender on
conventional and nuclear weapons and plans to consolidate this position
by maintaining significant technological superiority over its
adversaries, which will, as is well appreciated, push Beijing,
Moscow---and thus other regional powers---to respond. Yet spending on
nuclear weapons alone is set to pose significant budgeting difficulties
for future US governments. According to a 2014 report by the James
Martin Center, the Departments of Defense and Energy plan to spend
approximately \$1 trillion over the next 30 years 'to maintain its
current nuclear arsenal and procure a new generation of nuclear-armed or
nuclear capable bombers and submarines' as well as new submarine
launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and inter-continental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs). Arms Control Today has found that total Defense
Department nuclear spending 'is projected to average more than \$40
billion in constant fiscal year 2016 dollars between 2025 and 2035, when
modernization costs are expected to peak'. Including costs for the
Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration's
projected weapons-related spending during this period 'would push
average spending during this period to more than \$50 billion per year'.
If anywhere near these sums are spent, then the modest reductions to the
US's nuclear stockpile achieved during the Obama presidency will be
entirely overshadowed. Moreover, as analyst Andrew Lichterman notes, the
US's continued modernisation of its nuclear forces is 'inherently
incompatible' with the 'unequivocal undertaking' given at the 2000 NPT
Review Conference to eliminate its nuclear arsenal and apply the
'principle of irreversibility' to this and related actions. For
Lichterman, the huge outlays committed to the nuclear weapons complex
were part of a political 'bargain' made by the Obama administration with
Republicans. This ensured that the New START nuclear arms control treaty
would pass in the Senate whilst also not disturbing the development of
missile defense and other advanced conventional weapons programmes. New
START is a bilateral agreement between Russia and the US, which Steven
Pifer describes as 'one of the few bright spots' that exists in these
nations' relationship. Under the treaty Moscow and Washington must, by
2018, reduce their stockpile of operationally deployed strategic nuclear
warheads to 1,550. Furthermore, both must keep to a limit of 700
deployed strategic launchers (missiles) and heavy bombers, and to a
combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers and
heavy bombers. Despite New START 'proceeding smoothly' according to
Pifer, Hans Kristensen recently produced a report comparing Obama's
record with that of the previous presidents holding office during the
nuclear age, which found that, hitherto, Obama has cut fewer
warheads---in terms of numbers rather than percentages---than 'any
administration ever' and that 'the biggest nuclear disarmers' in recent
decades have been Republicans, not Democrats. Kristensen thus drily
observes of this situation that, a conservative Congress does not
complain when Republican presidents reduce the stockpile, only when
Democratic president try to do so. As a result of the opposition, the
United States is now stuck with a larger and more expensive nuclear
arsenal than had Congress agreed to significant reductions. As his
presidency draws to a close, presumably as a means of securing some sort
of meaningful legacy in this area, it has been reported that Obama
considered adopting a no first use (NFU) policy for nuclear weapons,
something which, whilst reversible, could act as a restraint on future
presidents. Yet this was apparently abandoned, according to the New York
Times, after 'top national security advisers argued that it could
undermine allies and embolden Russia and China'. Furthermore, according
to Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, the governments of Japan, South
Korea, France and Britain all privately communicated their concerns
about Washington adopting NFU. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is also
said to have argued that such a move would be unwise because 'if North
Korea used biological weapons against the South the United States might
need the option of threatening a nuclear response'. However, as Daryll
Kimball explains, the US's 'overwhelming' conventional military
advantage means that 'there is no plausible circumstance that could
justify---legally, morally, or militarily---the use of nuclear weapons
to deal with a non-nuclear threat'. Such resistance to NFU is thus
deeply disappointing given that, as Kimball goes on to note, this move
would go some way to reassuring China and Russia about the US's
strategic intentions. It would also be an important confidence-building
measure for the wider community of non-nuclear weapon states, showing
that the US is willing to act in \'good faith\' towards its disarmament
obligations under the NPT. Thinking about the causes of proliferation
more widely requires us to understand what drives weaker states to seek
deterrents, if their reliance on them is to be reduced. For example, as
Dr Alan J. Kuperman observes, NATO's bombing and overthrow of Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 'greatly complicated the task of
persuading other states such as Iran and North Korea 'to halt or reverse
their nuclear programs'. The lesson Tehran and Pyongyang took is thus
that because Gaddafi had voluntarily ended his nuclear and chemical
weapons programmes, the West now felt free to pursue regime change. When
assessing the importance of the Iran nuclear deal, which is often hailed
as one of Obama's landmark achievements, and which the next President
must not be allowed to derail, it is thus important also to consider
carefully what behaviour by the most powerful states will enable
existing or potential nuclear possessors to embrace disarmament and
reduce their interest in seeking non-conventional deterrents. The
inability of Washington to make substantial progress towards reducing
the salience of nuclear weapons at home and abroad is all the more
noteworthy when one considers the state of US and Russian public opinion
on nuclear arms control and disarmament. As John Steinbrunner and Nancy
Gallagher observe, 'responses to detailed questions reveal a striking
disparity between what U.S. and Russian leaders are doing and what their
publics desire'. For example, their polling found that: At the most
fundamental level, the vast majority of Americans and Russians think
that nuclear weapons have a very limited role in current security
circumstances and believe that their only legitimate purpose is to deter
nuclear attack. It is highly consistent, then, that the publics in both
countries would favor eliminating all nuclear weapons if this action
could be taken under effective international verification. Another
important measure which the US has failed to hitherto ratify is the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is despite President Obama
stating in 2009 that he intended to pursue Senate ratification of the
treaty 'immediately and aggressively'. Once more, there is notably
strong public support--82% according to a 2010 poll by the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs---for the US joining the CTBT but, again, the
Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the treaty at every
opportunity. Overall, the gap between the public's will and the
government's inaction on nuclear issues is alarming and redolent of the
wider democratic deficit in the US. On a more positive note, the fact
that the citizenry supports such measures suggests that groups
advocating arms control and disarmament initiatives should continue to
engage with and understand the public's positions in order to
effectively harness their support. Stepping back from the brink In terms
of priorities for the incoming administration in the US, stepping back
from military confrontation with Russia and pushing the threat of
nuclear war to the margins must be at the top of the list. Whilst much
has been made of a potential rapprochement between Trump and Putin, the
two have, reportedly, only just spoken for the first time on the phone
and still need to actually meet in person to discuss strategic issues
and deal with inevitable international events and crises, including in
relation to Ukraine and Syria. As of now, whilst the mood music from
both sides might suggest a warming of relations, as has been seen with
previous administrations, unless cooperation is rooted in a real
willingness to resolve problems (which for Russia includes US ballistic
missile defense deployments in Eastern Europe and NATO expansion) then
tensions can quickly re-emerge. **[Another]{.underline}** related
**[question concerns how Trump will conduct himself during any potential
crisis or conflict with Russia or another major power, given the stakes
and risks involved]{.underline}**, as highlighted above. Whilst we must
wait to find out precisely what the new administration's approach to
international affairs will be, in the past week, NATO's Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that he had been personally
informed by Donald Trump, following the election, that the US remains
'strongly committed to NATO, and that the security guarantees to Europe
stand'. Trump had previously shaken sections of the defence and foreign
policy establishment by suggesting that NATO was 'obsolete' and that
countries such as Japan (and by extension others such as South Korea and
Saudi Arabia) 'have to pay us or we have to let them protect
themselves', which could include them acquiring the bomb. One reason why
some in Washington have, in the past, not wanted their regional allies
to develop their own nuclear weapons is because the US might then become
dragged into an escalating conflict. Moreover, if an ally in one region
seeks the bomb, this may cause others elsewhere to pursue their own
capabilities- an act of strategic independence that might make these
states harder to influence and control. The US's key relationships in
East Asia and the Middle East illustrate why, if a future US President
wishes to take meaningful moves towards a world free of nuclear weapons,
then developing alternative regional political agreements, including
strategic cooperation with China and Russia, will be necessary. As Nancy
Gallagher rightly notes, the 'weaknesses of existing international
organizations' thus requires 'more inclusive, cooperative security
institutions' to be constructed regionally 'to complement and someday,
perhaps, to replace exclusive military alliances', alongside progressive
demilitarisation. Such confidence-building measures would also support
efforts to halt missile and nuclear tests by states such as North Korea,
which may soon be capable of striking the US mainland. Imagining the
next enemy As well as mapping out the US's current nuclear weapons
policies and its regional relationships, it is important to reflect upon
how **[domestic political dynamics under a Trump presidency might drive
Washington's behaviour internationally, particularly given the nuclear
shadow that always hangs over conflicts involving the US]{.underline}**.
For example, in the near-term, Trump's economic plan and **[the great
expectations amongst the American working class that have been
generated, may have particularly dangerous consequences]{.underline}**
if, as seems likely, the primary beneficiaries are the very wealthy.
Reviewing Trump's economic plans, Martin Wolf of the Financial Times
concludes that '**[the longer-term consequences are likely to be
grim]{.underline}**, not least for **[his]{.underline}**
**[angry,]{.underline}** but **[fooled, supporters]{.underline}**. Next
time, they **[might be even angrier. Where that might lead is
terrifying']{.underline}**. Gillian Tett has also highlighted the 'real
risks' that **[Trump's policies could 'spark US social unrest or
geopolitical uncertainty']{.underline}**. Elsewhere, George Monbiot in
the Guardian, makes the stark assertion that **[the inability of the
US]{.underline}** and other governments **[to respond effectively to
public anger means]{.underline}** he now believes that '**[we will see
war between the major powers]{.underline}** within my lifetime'. If
these warnings weren't troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry
Kissinger argued on BBC's Newsnight that 'the more likely reaction' to a
Trump presidency from terror groups 'will be to do something that evokes
a reaction' from Washington in order to 'widen the split' between it and
Europe and damage the US's image around the world. **[Given that Trump
has already vowed to 'bomb the shit out of ISIS' and refused to rule out
the use of nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying
that such a scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be
avoided so that the US does not play into the terrorists'
hands.]{.underline}** Looking more widely, President-elect Trump's
existing and potential cabinet appointments, which Glenn Greenwald has
summarised as 'empowering...by and large...the traditional, hard,
hawkish right-wing members of the Republican Party' also point to the US
engaging in future overseas conflicts, rather than the isolationism
which many in the foreign policy establishment criticised Trump for
proposing during the presidential campaign. William Hartung and Todd
Harrison have drawn attention to the fact that defence spending under
Trump could be almost \$1trillion (spread over ten years) more than
Obama's most recent budget request. Such projections, alongside Trump's
election rhetoric, suggest that the new nuclear monarch will try to push
wide open the door to more spending on nuclear weapons and missile
defense, a situation made possible, as we have seen, by Obama's
inability to implement progressive change in this area at a time of
persistent Republican obstruction. Conclusion The problem now, for the
US and the world, is that if Trump does make good on his campaign
promises then this will have several damaging consequences for
international peace and security and that **[if Trump does not
sufficiently satisfy his supporters then this will likely pour fuel on
the flames at home]{.underline}**, **[which may]{.underline}** then
**[quickly spread abroad]{.underline}**. The **[people of the
US]{.underline}** and the world thus **[now have a huge responsibility
to act as a restraining influence and ensure that the US retains an
accountable, transparent and democratic government]{.underline}**.
**[This]{.underline}** responsibility **[will only grow if crises or
shocks take place in]{.underline}** or outside **[the US]{.underline}**
which ambitious and extremist figures take advantage of, framing them as
threats to national security in order to protect their interests and
power. **[If such scenarios emerge the next administration and its
untried and untested President will find themselves with a range of
extremely powerful tools]{.underline}** and institutional experience
**[at their disposal, including nuclear weapons, which may prove too
tempting to resist when figuring out how to respond to widespread anger,
confusion and unrest, both at home]{.underline}** and abroad.

### Base Support High Now -- Gun Owners

#### Trump's base support high due to contrast with Obama on gun rights

**Nichols 6/8** (Bill, writer for the Valley News, 2019, "Column:
Looking for hope in the face of Trump's very firm base",

**[One puzzle future historians will be eager to solve is what really
explains the continued support for President Donald Trump long after
anyone paying attention can see his disdain for nearly all that has made
America great.\]{.underline}**
If the answer were simple, Democrats might have found effective ways to
charm Trump's base. **[And you'd think his support might have diminished
by now anyway, given the persistent efforts of journalists all over the
world to reveal the potentially catastrophic effects of Trump's
policies, as well as the corrosive power of his lies. But his boosters'
numbers stay pretty steady, sometimes growing in the face of scandals
and the exposure of lies.\]{.underline}**
A partial explanation for his durable support occurred to me recently
while reading the novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah (2013).
She explores the influences of race and racism in the United States.
Among other things, she considers the joy and hope Barack Obama's
election brought to black people. And Americanah reminded me of my own
failure to understand what his election meant to many white people.\
**[After Obama was elected in 2008, gun sales grew dramatically, and
many gun dealers reportedly ran out of ammunition. "It started the day
that Obama got elected," Johnny Dury, of Dury's Gun Shop in San Antonio,
Texas, told NPR. "It is when everything just went crazy in the gun
business." Like many who commented on the gun and ammunition sales
surge, I assumed this was primarily a response to the election of a
Democrat expected to push for gun regulations the National Rifle
Association and other gun rights organizations claimed would put the
country on the slippery slope to gun confiscation.\
It's a mistake to underestimate the influence of the NRA, but after
reading Americanah, I've concluded the response to Obama's election was
probably more visceral than that.]{.underline}**

#### Trump's base support is high now due to emphasis on national security

accessed 3/21/19) \[DS\]

Will declaring a national emergency on border security endanger
President Trump 's base or secure it? The answer likely determines
2020's outcome. **[Modern presidential politics is about building and
holding a base of supporters. Trump has decided to stake his precarious
one on immigration and national security]{.underline}**. In 2016, Trump
turned just 46.1 percent of the popular vote into a solid electoral
college victory. Despite what many saw as "winning by default," he has
governed as though by mandate. **[He has done exactly what he said he
would do, not pulling back just to shore up his minority
support]{.underline}**. **[Trump has played to his base, despite its
size. His course has worked pretty well for him. It is not
unique]{.underline}**. Trump's strategy follows the course of modern
American presidential politics. Winning --- and retaining --- the White
House means building and holding a base. Ideally, it also means
enlarging it, but above all, it must held. Precarious is not necessarily
a problem. Since 1976, eight of 11 presidential winners have gained less
than 51 percent of the popular vote. Two have lost re-election; both
lost their base. In 1976, Jimmy Carter of Georgia won every southern
state except Virginia and Oklahoma. In his 1980 defeat, Carter lost all
except Georgia. In 1988, George H.W. Bush ran on the Reagan legacy.
Breaking his "no new taxes" pledge, he went down in defeat in 1992. The
same applies even in the extreme case of impeachment. Nixon resigned
when it was clear Senate Republicans would not stand by him. Clinton
survived because Senate Democrats did. Today's question: How will
Trump's base react to a decision to declare a national emergency and
build a wall on the Mexican border. Will it secure or split it? There
will be Republican objections. Those concerned about expanding
government's scope --- particularly the presidency's --- will bridle.
And they will fear the precedent --- one that a Democrat president could
someday use --- more than the act. However, these Republicans are likely
not Trump's base. Presumably, a large portion are part of the 12 percent
of Republicans who exit polling showed supported someone else in 2016
--- 8 percent voted for Clinton and 4 percent voted for someone else or
did not answer. (Interestingly, an almost equal number of Democrats did
the same --- voting 8 percent Republican and 3 percent for "other"). So,
he is likely not endangering their support. **[Trump's support is also
comparatively strong as he undertakes this action]{.underline}**.
According to Rasmussen daily tracking polling, Trump had a 49/50 percent
approval/disapproval rating on Feb. 19. That negative rating snapped a
seven-day string of positive approval readings, a run unmatched since
February 2017. Although critics will dispute it, he also can claim he
has made a case for this action. Many will see the border situation as a
bona fide national emergency. Trump will point to his two-year inability
to get funding through Congress --- which he punctuated with history's
longest federal government shutdown. Despite an additional three-week
negotiating period, he obtained just \$1.4 billion of the \$5.7 billion
he requested. Of course, the left will refute this. However, they have
no choice but to. Their base requires it and if they let Trump's
national emergency declaration stand un-refuted, then their own
inactivity to address a national emergency is implicitly indicted. The
outcome in Congress and the courts is unclear. The high stakes involved
for Trump are transparently so. First, his reelection will be decided at
the margins. Should he win, it is likely to be close. **[That was the
nature of his 2016 victory and his governing in office since. He has
crafted a unique base and played to it thus far in
office.]{.underline}** The economy will provide him a significant 2020
tailwind, a signature win would crown it. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did
not provide the boost Republicans hoped for in the 2018 midterms.
ObamaCare still stands. A definitive, tangible accomplishment would
greatly help, but these will be hard to come by in a now divided
Congress. His renegotiated NAFTA trade deal still depends on Democratic
House support. Few things would be more definitive and tangible than the
wall he has championed since his candidacy. **[Few things offer more
individual credit than this done by presidential action]{.underline}**.
**[Thus far in his presidency, Trump has held his own]{.underline}**.
With his action on the wall, we now wait to see if he can continue to do
so --- his presidency likely depends on it.

### Base Support High Now -- Generic

#### Trump's favorability on the economy buoying him with his base despite other unfavorables

**[Among Republicans, Trumps approval rating is 86 percent. White males
approve of the job the president is doing by a 55 to 41 percent margin.\
"Despite very bad grades on honesty, empathy, leadership and fitness to
serve, President Donald Trump's granite strong base keeps him above 40
percent," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac
University Poll.\
Trump gets his best grades for his handling of the economy.\
A total of 64 percent of American voters say the nation's economy is
"excellent" or "good," while 35 percent say "not so good" or "poor,"
virtually unchanged from results of a December 18 survey, just before
the shutdown.\
President Trump's policies are helping the economy, 40 percent of voters
say, as 37 percent say they are hurting the economy and 20 percent say
his policies are not making a difference.]{.underline}**

#### Base support high despite wall funding fiasco

**Kumar 2/14** (Anita, White House Correspondent and Associate Editor at
Politico, 2019, "Trump saves face with his base after bruising wall
fight",
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/trump-national-emergency-border-wall-1170026>,
Aly M)

"It's not been a good couple of months," said Jonathan Felts, who served
as political director for President George W. Bush and is close to Trump
White House officials. **["That said, when I talk to rank-and-file Trump
supporters they are fine. From their perspective, he's doing the best he
can in a bad situation."]{.underline}**\
On Thursday afternoon, Trump announced a two-step maneuver that could
appease frustrated supporters. He will grudgingly sign a massive
congressional spending bill that includes just \$1.4 billion for border
security, less than a quarter of his last demand, but he will also
declare a national emergency to unlock Pentagon funds he can
unilaterally steer to a border wall as well as use money from other
projects.\
Conservatives who blasted the congressional compromise had already been
urging Trump to take that approach. **[In a Wednesday op-ed for Fox
News' website, Sean Hannity urged the president to sign Congress'
"garbage" deal and then declare a national emergency, showing "haters on
both sides of the aisle" that he is "tenacious, and he will fight to get
that wall built."]{.underline}**\
Trump's choice of that path came as something of a surprise. As of
Thursday afternoon he had been widely expected only to redirect federal
funds for the wall --- without taking the more dramatic step of
declaring a national emergency. Senior Republican leaders had urged
Trump not to declare an emergency, but he sided --- as he has so many
times before --- with core supporters like Hannity over the Washington
GOP establishment.\
**[Before the White House announced Trump's plans, Rep. Mark Meadows
(R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and a Trump
confidant, predicted that Trump's base would forgive him for signing
congress's spending bill if he then took unilateral steps to find more
border wall money.\
"I think there's very little political liability from conservatives,"
Meadows said.\
One outside adviser to the White House predicted that Trump's many fans
at Fox News, including Hannity, would wind up defending him. On Thursday
afternoon, the lead story on Fox's website highlighted finger-pointing
among New York state Democrats over Amazon's decision not to establish a
headquarters in the state.\
"This will pass," said the person, referring to Trump as "Teflon Don."\
Nor are Trump's conservative backers prepared to embrace Democrats, or
even one of the more moderate Republicans contemplating a GOP primary
challenge to Trump.\
"He is a whole lot better than the alternative," Felts
added.]{.underline}**

#### Trump retaining base support by centering re-election strategy around them

Aly M)

**[Rather than build from his base, like a traditional politician, Trump
is trying to expand his base and make it a larger share of the overall
electorate.\
The idea is for his campaign, which has begun to ramp up in recent
weeks, to identify, keep in contact with, and mobilize a new set of
pro-Trump voters who typically don\'t go to the polls. If it works, they
will fundamentally change the so-called universe of voters, offsetting
the loss of suburban Republicans at a time when his overall approval
ratings remain far below the break-even point.\
\"The successes of this presidency are fueling a groundswell of support
and are bringing in new voters,\" said Kayleigh McEnany, national press
secretary for the Trump campaign.\
That helps explain why Trump has been all about his base, even after a
midterm election in which House Republicans were handed a resounding
defeat and the GOP lost gubernatorial races in Midwestern battlegrounds
that were key to his 2016 victory.\
It\'s an echo of his strategy the first time around, when his 2016
campaign pounded away to bring conservative non-voters to the polls in
swing states.]{.underline}**

thanks to a Republican president elected with the help of the NRA.\
It's not hard to imagine the type of hysteria this move would have
caused if it had happened under President Obama.]{.underline}** But his
administration argued it was up to Congress to ban bump stocks. The
Trump administration took a different view. Under then--acting attorney
general Matthew Whitaker, the Department of Justice reinterpreted
existing federal law and moved forward with the ban by changing
regulations. **[It's the kind of thing that would have had Second
Amendment absolutists taking to the streets four years ago.\
Instead, many bump-stock owners begrudgingly followed the ATF's
guidelines and turned over or destroyed the devices.]{.underline}** "For
destruction, regardless of manufacturer or model, a Bump Stock must be
made incapable of being readily restored to its intended function by,
e.g., crushing, melting or shredding the Bump Stock," an ATF document
says. Cutting the device will also be allowed "so long as the Bump Stock
is completely severed in the areas constituting critical design
features." Those who don't comply could face ten years in prison and be
fined \$250,000.\
**[Perhaps surprisingly, the NRA has been largely silent on the subject.
The group's most aggressive pushback came in December, when it said it
was "disappointed" by the ban. It hasn't posted anything on Twitter or
Facebook today.]{.underline}** Gun Owners of America, another gun-rights
group, has aggressively fought the ban and the DOJ's authority to ban
the devices through regulations.

### 2NC -- Arms Sales Key

#### Arms sales are Trump's way of pleasing NRA which is vital to his base support

**Rampton 4/26** (Roberta, White House reporter for Reuters, 2019,
"Trump pulling U.S. out of U.N. arms treaty, heeding NRA",
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-nra-trump/trump-pulling-u-s-out-of-u-n-arms-treaty-heeding-nra-idUSKCN1S21RD>,

**[President Donald Trump told the National Rifle Association on Friday
he was pulling the United States out of an international arms treaty
signed in 2013 by then-President Barack Obama but opposed by the NRA and
other conservative groups.\
Trump told members of the gun lobby at an annual meeting he intends to
revoke the status of the United States as a signatory to the Arms Trade
Treaty, which was never ratified by the U.S. Senate.\
"We're taking our signature back," Trump said to thousands of cheering
attendees, many wearing red hats emblazoned with the Republican
president's "Make America Great Again" slogan.\
On Twitter, Trump called the decision a defense of "American
sovereignty." In reversing the U.S. position on the pact, he wrote, "We
will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment
freedoms."\
The NRA has long opposed the treaty, which regulates the \$70 billion
business in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands
of human rights abusers. The lobbying group argues it would undermine
domestic gun rights, a view the Obama administration rejected.\
The agreement covers weapons exports, ranging from small firearms to
tanks, but not domestic sales.]{.underline}**\
Trump said the United Nations would soon receive formal notice of the
withdrawal.\
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric called the treaty "a landmark
achievement in the efforts to ensure responsibility in international
arms transfers." U.N. officials said they were unaware Trump had been
planning to revoke the U.S. signature.\
**[The NRA spent \$30.3 million in support of Trump's 2016 presidential
campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that
tracks campaign spending.\]{.underline}**
The 193-nation U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the pact in
April 2013 and the United States, the world's No. 1 arms exporter, voted
in favor of it despite fierce opposition from the NRA.\
**[Dropping out of the treaty is part of a broader Trump administration
overhaul of arms export policies to bolster a domestic industry that
already dominates global weapons trade.\]{.underline}**
Trump's action drew an immediate rebuke from international human rights
groups.\
"The United States will now lock arms with Iran, North Korea and Syria
as non-signatories to this historic treaty whose sole purpose is to
protect innocent people from deadly weapons," said Oxfam America
President Abby Maxman.\
So far 101 countries have formally joined onto the treaty. Another 29,
including the United States, signed it, but have not yet formally
joined.\
Ted Bromund, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said the treaty "can only have the perverse effects of
driving potential importers to buy from China or Russia" and other
nations that are not party to the agreement.\
**[Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the
Stimson Center think-tank in Washington, said U.S. firearms makers could
benefit, including Smith & Wesson owner American Outdoor Brands Corp,
Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor, as well as Remington Outdoor Co, which
owns Bushmaster, a brand of AR-15 assault rifle.\]{.underline}**
Trump was joined on his trip to the NRA's meeting in Indianapolis by
White House national security adviser John Bolton, an advocate of
withdrawing the United States from international treaties out of concern
they might undermine U.S. authority.\
**[With Friday's announcement, Trump continued his drive to roll back
Obama-era initiatives.\]{.underline}**
Nearly two years ago, Trump announced that the United States would
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to reduce global
carbon emissions that scientists link to harmful climate change.
Republicans argue the U.S. economy would suffer if it met the deal's
carbon-reduction goals.\
In May, 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international
deal that eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for strict limits being
placed on Iran's nuclear activities. The United States has since
reimposed some sanctions that had been suspended under the deal.\
**[Friday's speech marked the third consecutive year Trump has spoken to
the annual meeting of the NRA. Since his election, he has been a vocal
proponent of gun rights, a position that plays well with his political
base.\]{.underline}**
Trump banned "bump stocks" - rapid-fire gun attachments used in the
October 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at a country music
festival in Las Vegas. **[But he has sidestepped tough restrictions he
considered after the February 2018 shooting at a high school in
Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed and embraced an NRA
proposal for arming teachers to defend schools.]{.underline}**

**[President Donald Trump on Friday made a campaign-style speech to one
of his most loyal political constituencies \-- gun rights activists \--
as he delivered his fifth consecutive speech to the National Rifle
Association\'s annual meeting.\
In dramatic fashion, Trump announced that he would not ratify a United
Nations arms trading treaty and then signed a message to the Senate in
front of an audience of NRA leaders.\]{.underline}**
\"The United Nations will soon receive a formal notice that the United
States is rejecting this treaty,\" the President said.\
\"As part of this decision, I will sign right now in front of a lot of
witnesses, a lot, a message asking the senate to discontinue the
ratification process and to return the now rejected treaty right back to
me in the Oval Office where I will dispose of it,\" Trump said.\
**[He said the actions \"reaffirmed that American liberty is sacred, and
that American citizens live by American laws, not the laws of foreign
countries.\"\
Trump then pulled out a pen and signed the document as the crowd
cheered. After showing the audience, he said they all \"want the pen.\"
The President then threw the \"famous pen\" to a member of the
audience.\]{.underline}**
During his winding, hour-long speech, Trump touted declining national
violent crime statistics following the start of his administration.
**[He also appeared to reference the 2015 terror attack on the Bataclan
theater in Paris, claiming that if just one person present at the 2015
concert had had a gun, fewer or even no people might have died that
night.\
\"If there was only one gun \-- if there were two, three, four \-- it
wouldn\'t have happened, a tiny percentage by comparison,\" Trump said.\
He noted that \"the shooting went on so long,\" but \"there was
nothing\" those present could do to stop the rampage.\
\"It probably wouldn\'t have happened,\" Trump said as he made the
argument for allowing people more access to guns.\]{.underline}**
Trump praised state laws that allowed teachers to carry guns in
classrooms.\
\"More than 30 states now allow teachers that are highly trained \--
highly trained, talented people \-- to carry guns in the classroom to
protect themselves and to protect their students who they love. Who\'s
better? Who\'s better? I\'ve been calling for that for the last two
years. I think we had a big impact,\" Trump said.\
He also highlighted several people who had intervened in attacks because
they had been carrying firearms.\
**[\"Gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation
stronger,\" Trump said.\]{.underline}**
The President also mocked Democratic presidential candidate Bernie
Sanders\' statements on voting rights.\
\"You see what\'s going on. \'Let the Boston bomber vote.\' He should be
voting, right? I don\'t think so,\" the President said at the meeting.
\"\'Let terrorists that are in prison vote.\' I don\'t think so. Can you
believe it? That this where some of these people are coming from? And
they\'re the most popular ones.\"\
Sanders had said during a CNN town hall earlier this week that felons
should be allowed to vote, even if they\'re still incarcerated.\
Longtime ally\
**[Trump has maintained a close relationship with the gun lobby and its
activists throughout his presidency after the group spent more than \$30
million to help elect him in the 2016 presidential election, rejecting a
push to reform the nation\'s gun laws in the wake of several mass
shootings in 2018. With 2020 on the horizon, Trump will once again be
looking to the group to help galvanize gun rights supporters and bolster
his reelection campaign.\]{.underline}**
But while the President will surely tout his administration\'s efforts
to maintain the status quo on gun rights, his speech also comes as he
fumes about Democrats\' attempts to build a case that he obstructed
justice based on special counsel Robert Mueller\'s report.\
**[A crowd of some of his most loyal supporters often drives the
President to deliver a speech full of red meat and attacks on his
political opponents.\

range of base-pleasing topics and included an airing of grievances

### 2NC -- AT: Media Spin

#### Conservative Media support isn't locked in- going back on key campaign promises could flip them, that collapses the base

**[Washington insiders wonder how long Trump can survive. The answer is:
as long as he holds his base.]{.underline}** **[Trump and his voters are
locked in a deadly embrace: his base desperately wants to believe he
will address their grievances and Trump is willing to lie to keep their
support.]{.underline}** In her latest insightful Trump analysis, in the
New York Review, Elizabeth Drew observed, "Trump is, for all his deep
flaws, in some ways a cannier politician than \[former President\]
Nixon; he knows how to lie to his people to keep them behind him \...
People can have a hard time recognizing that they've been conned. And
Trump is skilled at flimflam, creating illusions." Despite Trump's
"flimflam," his approval ratings steadily decline. FiveThirtyEight finds
that 56 percent disapprove of the job trump is doing versus 38 percent
that approve. Nonetheless, 82 percent of Republicans approve of Trump.
Elizabeth Drew asks the question that most Trump opponents have been
pondering: "**[When]{.underline}**, or **[will, Trump's voters realize
that he isn't delivering on his promises]{.underline}**, that his health
care and tax proposals will help the wealthy at their expense, that he
isn't producing the jobs he claims?" There are four **[factors that
determine Trump's base support]{.underline}**: the first is his health.
Donald is 71, overweight, with a poor attitude towards food, sleep, and
exercise. During his recent overseas junket, his staff described him as
"exhausted." (Trump is limiting further trips because of the
exhaustion.) During a sojourn in Italy, Trump wasn't able to walk to a
restaurant with other world leaders and travelled the short distance in
a golf cart. Some of Trump's erratic behavior could be the result of
poor physical health. If his health deteriorates further ― for example,
he is unable to travel overseas or to attend campaign rallies ― then
Trump will be labeled as "weak," "frail," "incompetent," and "pathetic."
The second factor that could impact Trump's support **[is media
coverage]{.underline}**. While the mainstream media (MSNBC, CNN, New
York Times, Washington Post\...) has reported adversely on Trump's
behavior, **[the right-wing media]{.underline}** (Fox, Breitbart\...)
**[has been supportive.]{.underline}** (When Trump said he was
"vindicated" by James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence
Committee, the mainstream media scoffed but the right-wing media echoed
Trump's sentiments.) **[What could cause the right-wing media to
shift?]{.underline}** Elizabeth Drew noted that Trump is a "cannier"
politician than Nixon. "**[He can \... make use of social media, Fox
News, and friendly talk shows to keep \[his base\]
loyal."]{.underline}** Trump has the ability to dominate the daily news
by means of a tweet or a call to a conservative talk-show host.
However**[, as the Trump-Russia investigation has accelerated he has
lost some of this advantage.]{.underline}** (For example, during the
week of June 5th **[the news was dominated by]{.underline}** James
**[Comey]{.underline}** **[not]{.underline}** by Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}**.) **[If Trump]{.underline}** continues to
**[fail to perform]{.underline}** ― if, for example, the Senate is
unable to make progress on health care ― or if evidence of his physical
limitations becomes more obvious, **[then the right-wing media will turn
on him]{.underline}**.

following his letter to Congress last October, in which he disclosed
that the FBI was investigating further emails that could be pertinent to
Hillary Clinton's email server,5 and Comey had been a Republican for
most of his life. The White House's initial rationalization for firing
Comey --- which criticized him for speaking out so publicly about the
Clinton case --- didn't make a lot of sense. That's not to say that
reaction to the firing didn't polarize itself along partisan lines ---
it eventually did. But the firing had **[to produce at least a little

versions of the GOP health care bill, meanwhile, were oddly designed
hybrids **[that didn't give Republican voters a lot of reason to get on
board]{.underline}**. The House and Senate plans neither fully repealed
Obamacare (as Republicans had promised to do since 2010), nor did they
replace it with the sort of health care program that Trump had promised
to voters. And the GOP bills would especially have hurt lower-income,
older voters in rural areas --- exactly the sort of people who were most
inclined to vote for Trump last year. Reactions to Charlottesville
followed a more predictably partisan course, by contrast. For better or
worse, views on racial equality --- which groups are advantaged and
which are discriminated against --- now strongly divide voters between
the parties. And Trump has attempted to pivot the Charlottesville
discussion into one about Confederate statues, which also provoke a
highly partisan response. Proposition No. 5: **[Be especially wary of
expecting big changes in Trump's approval rating from 'cultural'
issues]{.underline}**. This follows from the previous conclusion about
partisan polarization. **[Issues related to race]{.underline}**, gender,
sexuality, **[religion and social class have long been an animating
force in American politics,]{.underline}** of course. **[But they've
come back in an especially strong way in the Trump era, so much so that
views on these questions tend to be stronger markers of support for
Trump than views on economic and policy issues.]{.underline}** So it's
not that issues like the ones raised by the events in Charlottesville
are unimportant to Americans. It's that they're already "priced in" to
voters' overall political orientations and assessments of Trump. When
new controversies crop up along similar lines, they may not affect voter
preferences very much. Proposition No. 6: **[Expect bigger changes when
Trump's behavior is truly surprising or defies promises he made to
voters]{.underline}**. **[Speaking of "priced in," Trump's approval
rating hasn't been affected much when he does something, however
controversial, that's consistent with his previous
behavior]{.underline}**. If Trump's equivocal stance toward white
supremacists after Charlottesville was surprising to the media, it was
perhaps less so to voters given that Trump had been slow to denounce
groups such as the KKK as a candidate last year and that his rhetoric
had often been racially tinged. In a poll conducted last August, 51
percent of voters described Trump as "racist." By contrast, the
Republican health care bill was inconsistent with the promises that
Trump had made to voters on the campaign trail. And Trump had also
repeatedly promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he hasn't
been able to do yet. It's not surprising, therefore, that health care
hurt his numbers more than Charlottesville. By this rule, an economic
downturn could be especially harmful to Trump given that he made very
aggressive promises to voters about job creation.

**[The Democratic Party has an immigration problem]{.underline}**. That
may be a surprising statement to make about a political party that wins
the lion's share of the votes of Latinos and Asian Americans -- the two
groups most closely linked to immigration. But a broader look at the
numbers suggests that **[immigration is hurting Democrats more with
white voters than it is helping them with non-white
voters.]{.underline}** Yes, immigration is an important issue for most
Latinos and Asian Americans. And yes, the overwhelming majority of
Latinos and Asian Americans who care a great deal about immigration
support the Democratic Party. All told 72 percent of Latinos and 66
percent of Asian Americans voted for Democratic candidates for Congress
in this year's midterms. That is an important boost for the Democratic
Party. But it is only a relatively small part of the partisan story on
immigration. Despite decades of historically high rates of immigration,
**[Latinos and Asian Americans only made up 11 percent of the midterm
electorate]{.underline}**. Even if immigration was the only issue
driving their vote -- and it most certainly was not -- it could only
shift the national partisan balance of power by a few percentage points.
**[The much bigger story is the white vote]{.underline}**. **[Whites
accounted for 75 percent of the electorate in the midterm
election]{.underline}**. As such, **[whites]{.underline}**, **[far more
than any other group]{.underline}**, **[will decide the fate of the
Democratic]{.underline}** **[and Republican]{.underline}** **[Parties in
the years to come]{.underline}**. **[Unfortunately, for the Democratic
Party, the data suggest that immigration very much matters for whites as
well.]{.underline}** Why does immigration matter to whites? To begin
with, immigration is almost impossible to ignore. Immigrants are growing
in number, they are moving to almost every corner of the nation, and,
when they arrive, they tend to look different racially from the existing
white majority. They are visibly present in most of our lives. **[The
growing presence of immigrants has been accompanied by an ongoing and
oft repeated threat narrative that links them to a host of pernicious
fiscal, social, and cultural consequences]{.underline}**.
**[Irrespective of the actual costs of immigration, the narrative
maintains that immigrants are relying heavily on public services like
welfare]{.underline}**, education, and health while paying few taxes.
**[It asserts that immigrants are taking jobs away from natives and
lowering their wages]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** it contends
that immigration is **[leading to cultural decline]{.underline}**.
**[The threat narrative is almost ubiquitous.]{.underline}** **[Even the
New York Times' coverage of immigration has been
lop-sided]{.underline}**. Analysis of all Times articles that touched on
immigration between 1980 and 2011 indicates that **[stories on
immigration with a negative overall tone outnumbered positive stories by
four-to-one. When we talk about immigration, we typically highlight its
costs and complications, fueling white fears. While individual views on
immigration are diverse]{.underline}** -- with many white Americans
either supportive or ambivalent about immigration --- **[most are deeply
concerned]{.underline}**. **[Polls indicate that an overwhelming
majority of white Americans view illegal immigration as a serious
problem]{.underline}**. **[Well over a third thinks immigration is a bad
thing]{.underline}** for the country. **[The bottom line is that
immigration produces real anxiety among large segments of the white
public]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- AT: Economy Thumps

#### Economic issues don't matter to the base

**Wilkinson 18\-\--**Francis, editorial writer on politics and US
domestic policy for Bloomberg, \"Election Analysts Discover Even More
White Voters\" Bloomberg, February 2,
https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-02/election-analysts-discover-even-more-white-voters\]

It seems that **[even more white voters are coming out of the electoral
woodwork]{.underline}**. Political analyst Ruy Teixeira and co-authors
have just produced a study arguing that **[the exit-poll data in 2016
was all wrong.]{.underline}** They're not the first to do so. The
election was barely concluded before pollsters Matt Barreto and Gary
Segura were arguing that exit surveys had substantially over-counted
Donald Trump's share of the Hispanic vote. But the revision by Teixeira,
co-author of the influential 2002 book "The Emerging Democratic
Majority," is different. **[The most salient difference here is that the
exit polls underestimated the share of white voters and overestimated
the share of voters of color]{.underline}**. Our estimate is that 73.7
percent of voters were white (compared to 71 percent in the exits), 8.9
percent were Latino (compared to 11 percent), and 5.5 percent were Asian
or other race (compared to 7 percent). However, our figures agree with
the exit polls on the percent of black voters (12 percent). **[Not only
were whites under-counted]{.underline}**, according to Teixeira, whose
report was published by the liberal Center for American Progress, **[but
whites without college educations were especially under-counted. The
exit polls radically overestimated the share of white college-educated
voters and radically underestimated the share of white
non-college-educated voters.]{.underline}** The exit polls claimed that
white college graduates actually outnumbered non-college-educated white
voters at the polls in 2016, 37 to 34 percent. Our data indicate a
vastly different story: White college graduates were only about 29
percent of voters, while their non-college-educated counterparts far
outdistanced them at 45 percent of voters. Exit polls are never the
final word on elections. Teixeira and his colleagues relied on a variety
of additional data, including Census information, to reconstruct the
electorate. I lack the expertise to confirm or rebut their findings. But
if they're right, **[the combination of increased non-college white
voting, along with the shift in non-college white votes from Democratic
to Republican, raises serious questions for near-term Democratic
strategy]{.underline}**. **[Turnout among both white college-educated
and white non-college-educated voters went up]{.underline}**. However,
**[turnout increased more among white non-college-educated
voters]{.underline}**, increasing 3 points from 54 percent to 57
percent, compared to a 2-point increase among white college graduates,
from 78 percent to 80 percent. Democrats have been faring unusually well
among college-educated whites ever since Trump's victory. The party's
sweep across highly educated Virginia in 2017 legislative elections
surpassed virtually all expectations. But if non-college whites are both
turning out in greater numbers and voting more Republican, then the
Democratic path back to power is more complicated. **[In Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin]{.underline}** in 2016, **[the party ran into
a buzzsaw of white non-college voters]{.underline}** that seems to have
been exacerbated by declines in black voter turnout and in the
Democratic margin among blacks compared with 2012. "In all three states,
our data indicate that the percentage of the voting electorate that was
white and non-college-educated was much higher than was suggested by the
exit polls," Teixeira wrote. "In two of the three states --- Michigan
and Pennsylvania --- Clinton would have been able to carry the states if
this group's turnout had remained at 2012 levels." **[What exactly do
Democrats, who are currently defining themselves, with Republican help,
as the party of]{.underline}** (mostly brown) **[immigrants, do with
this analysis, both for the 2018 midterms and beyond?]{.underline}**
"Bottom line, he is right," emailed pollster Paul Maslin, a Wisconsin
Democrat who has been arguing that **[Democrats can't afford to give up
on working-class white voters even as they gain ground among Asians,
Hispanics and college-educated suburban whites]{.underline}**. It may be
that the suburbs are more productive in terms of winning the House seats
needed to win back the majority in 2018, but statewide, and in terms of
2020, Teixeira is dead right. It could be a decade, or more, before the
millennial/college-educated/minority coalition is strong enough to
withstand any further declines among the white working class. And what
if there are cracks in that coalition, Republicans put a Latino or
Asian-American on the ticket, or millennials start moving some other
way? Demographic trends remain powerfully in Democrats' favor, but they
are no lock on the future. In effect, the emerging Democratic majority,
which seemed to have come to fruition with the rise of Barack Obama, is
still emerging, and always subject to change. Democrats can appeal to
working-class whites on economic grounds. There is evidence that Donald
Trump is struggling to hold his support among white women, including
non-college-educated white women. But **[Trump's appeals to white
identity complicate the Democrats' task. As political scientist John
Sides of George Washington University wrote about Trump's core
voters,]{.underline}** "**[Support for Trump depended far less on
personal economic anxiety --- 'I'm afraid of losing my job' --- than on
a distinctly racialized anxiety: 'I think minorities are taking jobs
from people like me.'"]{.underline}** In an email, Teixeira says
**[Democrats have no choice but to continue appealing for non-college
white votes.]{.underline}** My view is that, for the Democrats, now is
that time to start building up a strong, simple, salable economic
approach that has some chance of appealing across race and class.
Remember that **[Clinton, despite her candidacy having strong positions
on racism and immigration, did not succeed all that well with black and
Latino turnout and support]{.underline}**. So **[even if we're talking
about base mobilization, it does not necessarily follow that Democratic
candidates should emphasize issues that are directly about race and
immigration over economic concerns]{.underline}**. Given the
extraordinarily narrow 2016 margins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin, fewer than 80,000 votes over the three states combined, even
a small movement of whites from GOP to Democratic, or even to nonvoting,
would yield potentially decisive results in 2020. At the same time,
however, the rising multiracial portion of the electorate is demanding a
firm Democratic response to Trump's appeals to white racial resentment.
**[The immigration debate, which Trump has made explicitly racial, makes
straddling the divide especially perilous.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Link -- Evangelicals

#### Trump's evangelical support is key and gun rights issues are central to that base

**MacBride 18** (Elizabeth, business journalist for Forbes, 9/26, "An
Evangelical Minister Left The Gun Tribe. Then, He Paid A Price.",

His decision in the past few years to step away from tribal politics and
return to preaching his faith and conscience could portend a movement by
evangelicals away from their generational hard-and-fast support of the
Republican Party, and perhaps from politics in general. **[Eighty-one
percent of evangelicals voted for Trump, according to Schenck's book,
Costly Grace.\
Schenck's conversion away from right-wing politics began about five
years ago, on the issue of gun rights, which he calls "gun doctrine."
His change of heart has cost him dearly: The evangelical nonprofit he
founded, Faith and Action in the Nation's Capital, lost 20% of its
funding after he broke political ranks on the issue of guns. He's had to
step down.\]{.underline}**
As Schenck tells his story, the staff at the Club hovers over our table;
it's clear he's known and loved there. With his long arms and glasses,
he exudes deep empathy and humility, and can hardly resist ministering
to me when he hears I've recently lost my mother. He never hesitates
when he talks, even during what must be the painful parts of his story.\
The day of the Navy Yard shooting, he says, he grabbed his prayer stole
and Bible and headed to the scene to pray. Twelve people died that day,
and three others were wounded. He began to question the idea that gun
rights were absolute. **[When he first shared his intention to speak up
in favor of gun control with leaders among his membership base of 300
churches and allied organizations, "there were immediate threats," he
said. "People told me, if you go down this road, you won't get another
dime of my money.\
He says it's been painful. "I don't like losing relationships. These
people have been colleagues for 25 or 30 years," he says. "Long time
colleagues came after me on Facebook like trolls."\
Schenck is the only person to speak with me on the record about the
implied and real threats aimed at people in the folds of the right-wing
gun community who have developed doubts about absolutes when it comes to
gun rights.]{.underline}** But two other owners of businesses that
operate in the gun world reached out after interviews to retract some of
their statements about the political positions and tactics of gun rights
organizations.

### 2NC -- AT: Base Resilient

#### Base support isn't Teflon -- the plan cuts across partisan lines and represents a major betrayal -- tanks his support. 

**Silver 18** \[Nate, editor in chief of Five Thirty Eight, \"7 Rules
For Reading Trump's Approval Rating\" Five Thirty Eight \--
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/7-rules-for-reading-trumps-approval-rating/\]

Proposition No. 4: **[Expect bigger approval rating changes from issues
that cut across partisan lines]{.underline}**. As I mentioned, **[the
clearest declines in Trump's approval ratings came after]{.underline}**
he fired Comey and at moments **[related to the health care
bill]{.underline}** --- first in March when the GOP began to debate its
proposal, and then more recently following the collapse of the bill late
last month. Each of these **[issues cut across partisan lines in awkward
ways]{.underline}**. Republicans, including Trump, had praised Comey
following his letter to Congress last October, in which he disclosed
that the FBI was investigating further emails that could be pertinent to
Hillary Clinton's email server,5 and Comey had been a Republican for
most of his life. The White House's initial rationalization for firing
Comey --- which criticized him for speaking out so publicly about the
Clinton case --- didn't make a lot of sense. That's not to say that
reaction to the firing didn't polarize itself along partisan lines ---
it eventually did. But the firing had **[to produce at least a little
bit of cognitive dissonance for voters]{.underline}**. The various
versions of the GOP health care bill, meanwhile, were oddly designed
hybrids **[that didn't give Republican voters a lot of reason to get on
board]{.underline}**. The House and Senate plans neither fully repealed
Obamacare (as Republicans had promised to do since 2010), nor did they
replace it with the sort of health care program that Trump had promised

older voters in rural areas --- exactly the sort of people who were most

which are discriminated against --- now strongly divide voters between

highly partisan response. Proposition No. 5: **[Be especially wary of
expecting big changes in Trump's approval rating from 'cultural'

come back in an especially strong way in the Trump era, so much so that
views on these questions tend to be stronger markers of support for
Trump than views on economic and policy issues.]{.underline}** So it's
not that issues like the ones raised by the events in Charlottesville
are unimportant to Americans. It's that they're already "priced in" to
voters' overall political orientations and assessments of Trump. When

hurt his numbers more than Charlottesville. By this rule, an economic
downturn could be especially harmful to Trump given that he made very
aggressive promises to voters about job creation.

#### Variations among reluctant voters proves support isn't resilient -- plan is the last straw.

Reluctant Voters Are Getting More Reluctant\" Five Thirty Eight \--

micah (Micah Cohen, politics editor): It's time for our weekly politics
chat! Welcome, all. Today we're going to do something a little different
and --- particularly after Trump's speech in Arizona on Tuesday night,
which seemed squarely aimed at pleasing his most devoted supporters ---
use this chat to talk about "**[reluctant Trump voters]{.underline}**"
and how they were feeling about the administration ahead of his Arizona
speech but also in the wake of Charlottesville and Steve Bannon's
departure. Clare, you've been writing about this group, wanna give us a
definition? clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): Well,
**[they're generally white, middle-aged,]{.underline}** relatively
well-educated, **[less "brand loyal" to the Republican Party, and they
didn't vote for President Trump enthusiastically]{.underline}**. They
were "not excited" to cast their ballot for him in November. micah:
Perfect ... so **[we just got a new batch of data]{.underline}** from
SurveyMonkey **[on how this group is feeling]{.underline}**. They polled
3,227 adults between Aug. 18 and Aug. 21. I'm gonna throw results at you
all, and we'll talk about them one-by-one. That's a pretty huge
difference. What do you make of it? clare.malone: Trump could shoot
someone on Fifth Avenue, and some of his people would still love him. I
mean, **[what we can take from those numbers is that the reluctant Trump
people are more likely to have voted for Trump because he WASN'T Hillary
Clinton, and they were hoping that they would see some
results]{.underline}** --- a course change. Given that this
**[administration]{.underline}** has very few legislative
accomplishments to its name and some serious organizational problems,
**[it makes sense that these unenthused voters are
worried.]{.underline}** harry (Harry Enten, senior political writer):
Well, I'm not the biggest fan of the "right direction, wrong direction"
question myself. I don't know what it really tells us. But it's
interesting that just 30 percent of the overall sample said the country
was going in the right direction. That means the reluctant Trump
sample's views were far closer to the average voter's than the average
enthusiastic Trump voter. natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): I
agree with Clare. You wouldn't expect people who voted for Trump only as
a last resort to be especially happy about the state of the country. But
I also agree with Harry that I'm not quite sure how the "right
direction" numbers translate into voting behavior. harry: We all agree.
Hugs to all 😀. micah: Boring! harry: There's nothing boring about love
... micah: Next ... harry: More enthused Trump voters feel about the
same as they did last time we tested that in early June, but **[the
percentage of reluctant Trump voters who approve of the president's job
is down 11 percentage points, from 74 percent before]{.underline}**.
**[That's a fairly substantial slide.]{.underline}** natesilver: And
**[that]{.underline}** sorta **[cuts against the talking point that
there's nothing Trump can do to alienate the people who voted for
him]{.underline}**. In fact, **[the numbers are a bit worse than they
appear on the surface]{.underline}**. **[Among reluctant supporters,
only 6 percent strongly approve of Trump. A higher percentage, 14
percent, strongly disapprove of his performance]{.underline}**. harry:
**[And that 6 percent who strongly approve is well down from 15
percent]{.underline}** in June.

#### Resiliency is a myth

**Silver 18** \[Nate, editor in chief @ 538, \"Why A Trump Pivot Might
Backfire\" Five Thirty Eight \--
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-trump-pivot-might-backfire/\]

As we wrote back in the spring, **[it's something of a myth that Trump
has an enormous base that's impervious to any and all missteps from the
White House]{.underline}**. Instead, **[he has his fair share of
support, but it's a mix of base voters]{.underline}** (about 20 percent
of the population) **[and other voters who support him more
reluctantly]{.underline}** (16 or **[17 percent of Americans "somewhat
approve" of Trump]{.underline}**). **[What Trump doesn't have is very
many people who "somewhat disapprove" of his performance]{.underline}**;
this group makes up only about 11 percent of the country. **[It might
not sound helpful to have voters who somewhat disapprove of you, but
they're a lot easier to bring over to your side than voters who strongly
disapprove of you]{.underline}**.

#### Base isn't unbreakable -- support is fragile

Political Science at the University of Rhode Island, "Horowitz: Trump's
Base Begins to Erode," Sept 5^th^
http://www.golocalprov.com/politics/horowitz-trumps-base-begins-to-erode)

**[When fending off questions about]{.underline}** President **[Trump's
record low approval]{.underline}** ratings, **[his surrogates
continually refer to his supposedly impregnable base]{.underline}**. As
President Trump himself put it during the campaign, \"I could stand in
the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\'t lose
voters.\" **[A recent Pew Research Center poll]{.underline}** **[shows
that base beginning to erode as]{.underline}** a substantial percentage
of **[Republicans and white working class voters express]{.underline}**
major **[doubts about Trump's performance]{.underline}** as President.
According to the poll, only a little more than 1-in-3 Republicans say
they like the way that Trump conducts himself as President, as opposed
to nearly half who indicate mixed feelings and nearly 1-in-5 who say
they don't like the way he conducts himself as President. Similarly,
less than half of Republicans say the President is even tempered.
Further, more than 4-in-10 Republicans say he is selfish and more than
3-in-10 say he is prejudiced. While Trump's conduct is the most
predominant concern of Republicans, **[there is]{.underline}** also **[a
significant percentage who diverge from him on the
issues]{.underline}**; 3-in-10 Republicans say they agree with him on
few or no issues. He may also may want to re-think his pattern of
attacking Republican leaders in Congress. The poll shows it is not only
counterproductive in advancing his legislative agenda; it is probably
backfiring with the public. Nearly 6-in-10 Republicans want Trump to
listen more to Republican leaders who have experience in government.
Public opinion expert William Galston found similar doubts among
non-Democratic, white, working class voters polled by Pew. Nearly
6-in-10 of these voters say Trump is selfish and half believe he is
dishonest. There is also limited issue agreement with the President
among this sub-set of the electorate. Given that there is much overlap
between white working class voters and Republicans, the fact that these
groups express similar opinions is not surprising. Galston, who
requested that Pew segment out white, working class voters for purposes
of his analysis, aptly summarizes President Trump's disastrous political
position." Divide and conquer is what you're supposed to do to the other
side, not your own. Whatever the alt-right press may say, this is not a
formula for success." He expands on this point, "There is a classic
formula for political success: unify your supporters and divide your
opponents. Looking beyond the white working class to the full survey,
Pew finds that after seven months in office, President Trump has done
the opposite: Democrats are united against him while Republicans are
divided in their assessment.\" President Trump's over-all approval
rating is now about 36%\--which by itself is highly problematic\--and a
substantial part of the reason for his inability to advance his agenda
in Congress. And his approval with Republicans has dropped from close to
90% to about 75%. Also, the percentage of Republicans who strongly
approve of the job Trump is doing has significantly declined. But **[the
PEW poll shows that he may not have yet reached the
bottom]{.underline}**. Without a major course correction, his base will
continue to erode. As with voting decisions, **[measures of approval
tend to be lagging indicators]{.underline}**. Generally speaking,
**[doubts emerging about issue positions]{.underline}** and personal
qualities **[precede a voter changing]{.underline}** his **[mind
about]{.underline}** whether or not **[a President]{.underline}** or
other elected official is doing a good job. This Pew poll should be a
wake-up call for the President and his supporters. **[He]{.underline}**
not only **[risks growing political impotence]{.underline}**; the
prospect of John Kasich or some other challenger wresting the nomination
away from him in 2020 is as of today not as far-fetched as it may have
once seemed.

### AT: Twitter Checks

#### Twitter isn't effective

**Thrush and Haberman 17 --** Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman,
3-20-2017, \"Trump's Weary Defenders Face Fresh Worries,\" No
Publication,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/trump-obama-wiretap-comey.html>
KKC

President Trump began Monday as he has started so many other
presidential mornings --- by unleashing a blistering Twitter attack on
critics who suggested his 2016 campaign colluded with the Russians. By
the afternoon the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, had
systematically demolished his arguments in a remarkable public takedown
of a sitting president. Even a close ally of Mr. Trump, Representative
Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the House Intelligence
Committee chairman, conceded that "a gray cloud" of suspicion now hung
over the White House by the end of the day's hearings. The testimony of
Mr. Comey and that of Adm. Michael S. Rogers, his National Security
Agency counterpart, will most likely enervate and distract Mr. Trump's
administration for weeks, if not longer, overshadowing good news, like
the impressive debut of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, his Supreme Court
nominee, on the first day of his confirmation hearings Monday. But it's
the obsessiveness and ferocity of Mr. Trump's pushback against the
Russian allegations, often untethered from fact or tact, that is making
an uncertain situation worse. Mr. **[Trump's allies]{.underline}**
**[have begun to wonder if his need for self-expression, often on social
media, will exceed his instinct for self-preservation]{.underline}**,
with disastrous results both for the president and for a party whose
fate is now tightly tied to his. "The tweets make it much more difficult
for us as we try to build a case against these leakers," said
Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who sits on the
Intelligence Committee. "We always have to be answering questions about
the tweets --- it puts us on defense all the time when we could be
building a case for the president." And Mr. Trump's fixation on fighting
is undermining his credibility at a time when he needs to toggle from
go-it-alone executive action to collaborative congressional action on
ambitious health care, budget and infrastructure legislation. "I don't
always like what the president is saying," the Senate majority leader,
Mitch McConnell, told The Washington Examiner last month. "I do think he
frequently, by wading into other matters, takes attention away" from
"the very substantial things we're already accomplishing." A Gallup poll
released Monday found Mr. Trump with an abysmal 37 percent approval
rating; other recent polls place his popularity in the mid-40s, but even
that level is among the lowest ever recorded for a president this early
in his first term. Over the past several weeks, Republicans in Congress
and members of their staffs have privately complained that Mr. Trump's
Twitter comment on March 4 --- the one where he called Barack Obama
"sick" and suggested that the former president had ordered a "tapp" on
his phone --- had done more to undermine anything he's done as president
because it called into question his seriousness about governing. The
problem, from the perspective of Mr. **[Trump's beleaguered political
fire brigade, is that the president insists on dealing with crises by
creating new ones]{.underline}** --- so surrogates, repeating talking
points the president himself ignores, say they often feel like human
shields. Within the White House, a number of Mr. Trump's advisers ---
including the press secretary, Sean Spicer, who has himself repeated
unsubstantiated claims of British spying on Mr. Trump --- have told
allies that Mr. Trump's Twitter habits are making their jobs harder,
said administration officials interviewed over the past week. Mr. Spicer
said he has no problem with his boss's tweeting. "It's just not true. I
have not commented on the tweets to anyone including my wife," he said
in an email. Most politicians, perhaps any other politician, would have
backed away from the Russia story, and left the defense to surrogates or
unexpected validators like Mike Morrell, the former acting director of
the C.I.A., who said last week that "there is smoke, but there is no
fire at all" in the allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with
Russia. But this president, a proponent of do-it-yourself crisis
communications with boundless self-confidence in his capacity to shape
the story, seems determined to hug his Russian hand grenade. Monday
morning began not with praise of Judge Gorsuch --- or an exhortation of
House Republicans to quickly pass a revamped Obamacare repeal --- but
with six protective-crouch tweets about the Russia investigation. "The
Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running
a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!" Mr.
Trump wrote shortly after dawn, using his private Twitter account. Then,
a few minutes later: "The real story that Congress, the FBI and all
others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information.
Must find leaker now!" People close to the president say Mr. **[Trump's
Twitter torrent had less to do with fact, strategy or tactic than a
sense of persecution bordering on faith:]{.underline}** He simply
believes that he was bugged in some way, by someone, and that evidence
will soon appear to back him up. Plus he just likes to mix it up. He
fired off his ill-fated Saturday tweet complaining of "tapps" of his
phones after railing to aides about how poorly Attorney General Jeff
Sessions had responded to reports that he had surreptitiously
communicated with the Russians, the way Mr. Trump's former National
Security Council adviser, Michael T. Flynn, did. The president,
**[people close to him have said over the last several weeks, has become
increasingly frustrated at his inability to control the narrative of his
action-packed presidency, after being able to dominate the political
discourse or divert criticism by launching one of his signature Twitter
attacks.]{.underline}** "I think that maybe I wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for Twitter," Mr. Trump told a sympathetic interviewer, Tucker
Carlson of Fox News, last week. Still, **[there's some evidence that the
president's magic medium is losing its effectiveness]{.underline}**, in
part because Mr. **[Trump's Twitter persona]{.underline}** **[seems to
have]{.underline}** **[shifted from puckish to paranoid]{.underline}**.
Focus groups and polls conducted by two Democratic strategists this
month have shown that many voters, even some who support Mr. Trump, have
grown weary of his tweets as president. That was also borne out by a Fox
News poll last week, showing that a mere 35 percent of Trump voters
approve of his Twitter habits, and that only 16 percent of all voters
approve of them. Some 32 percent said they "wish he'd be more careful"
with his feed. "His tweeting defines him, and not in a good way," said
Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster. "Voters not only think
Trump's use of Twitter is unpresidential, they also see the tone and
content of his tweets as an indication that he is lacking in
self-control." Mr. Comey seemed to tacitly agree. In midafternoon came a
tweet from Mr. Trump's official \@potus account: "FBI Director Comey
refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael
Flynn to Russia." A dour and disapproving Mr. Comey instantly
fact-checked the tweet when it was read out loud to him. "No," he said.
"It was not our intention to say that today."

### Base Decline 🡪 Diversionary War

#### Trump [only]{.underline} cares about his ratings and would be willing to start a war to maintain his political survival

**[Trump is an an amateur reality show actor]{.underline}**. For 14
years during his run on The Apprentice all he cared about was his
ratings. Surely he knows nothing else. He now perceives of himself in
his latest reality show called The American Presidency. **[Everything he
does he does to improve his ratings]{.underline}**. **[Trump's policies
are astonishingly superficial]{.underline}** --- generally bumper
sticker type stuff . **[Trump appears]{.underline}** to be **[completely
unconcerned]{.underline}** **[about]{.underline}** what is in **[the
best interest of America]{.underline}**. Trump is clearly out of his
depth in the White House. The Presidency confuses him. Trump keeps
making pronunciamentos and his staff keeps responding "You can\'t do
that." ( declare martial law in South Chicago and send in the National
Guard for example). To which Donald Trump keeps asking "Why can\'t I?"
No incumbent American president has ever lost a reelection campaign ---
not once- while and when American troops were involved in a shooting
war. (This is why George W Bush started the war in Iraq.) So yeah,
Donald **[Trump could conceivably start a war for no other purpose than
to ensure his reelection]{.underline}** **[in 2020.]{.underline}**

#### Popularity decline causes Trump lashout. 

**Vyse 17.** \[Graham, staff writer, "Trump Has a Plan for the Next
9/11. Democrats Need One" The New Republic \-- February 10 \--

At least one elected Democrat is already pushing this message. At last
Saturday's Congressional Progressive Caucus retreat in Baltimore,
Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state raised the issue in a
room full of liberal lawmakers planning their political strategy.
"**[There's another thing that's going to throw us off message, and
that's if we have any kind of an attack or a war]{.underline}**," she
said. "I just want us to be thinking about that because **[there are
lots of things that are happening right now that]{.underline}** you
could argue are **[setting us up for an attack]{.underline}**. I believe
**[that's true of the executive orders]{.underline}**, and we know what
happened after 9/11, and **[we have to be thinking]{.underline}** about
what is our jiu-jitsu move to actually prepare the stage so that if
something does happen it's clear who created that and who created the
environment for that to happen." After the attacks on the the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon **[in 2001, congressional Democrats almost
uniformly rallied around]{.underline}** President George W**[. Bush,
authorizing the Republican's use of military force in
Afghanistan]{.underline}**. Representative Barbara Lee, whom Jayapal
calls "a great hero of mine," was the lone "no" vote in Congress. It was
a period of intense nationalism and jingoism, and **[it's easy to
imagine Trump trying to exploit a similar sentiment]{.underline}** in
the service of his authoritarian agenda---or **[simply to improve his
dismal poll numbers]{.underline}**. "I mean, I'm not a conspiracy
theorist," Jayapal told her colleagues, "but I really do believe that
**[war is a great way to get your poll numbers up]{.underline}**. We
just need to be thinking about what happens when that comes forward and
how we prepare the stage right now with our message so that the blame
goes exactly where the blame should be and we don't all have to rally
around in patriotism."

### Base Key

#### Trump's base is key to his political survival -- he's solely catering to them now. 

**Bacon 7-28.** \[Perry Bacon Jr, senior writer, \"The Party
Establishment Wing Of Trumpworld Collapses\", July 28, 2018, Five Thirty
Eight \--
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-establishment-wing-of-trumpworld-collapses/\]

**[This isn't just a Beltway story of who is up and who is down. It
matters. The people who aren't in sync with Trump on his core
preferences could lose their ability to set policy in areas where the
president does not have strong views]{.underline}**. So let's revisit
our eight power centers. **[One wing that is basically defunct The Party
Wing]{.underline}** --- Priebus was running the Republican National
Committee when Trump named him White House chief of staff. And several
people from Priebus's RNC team snagged top slots at the White House,
including deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, senior assistant press
secretary Michael Short and Spicer. Walsh left the White House several
months ago --- it's not clear whether she was pushed out or exited
voluntarily. Spicer could have stayed on, but he had been disempowered.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the new press secretary, was already doing many
of the briefings that Spicer had done at the start of the
administration. Spicer had shifted to a role directing the White House's
broader communications strategy, but Scaramucci got that portfolio when
he was hired. Short resigned this week, with Scaramucci reportedly on
the verge of firing him.1 Why did the Party Wing struggle so much? Well,
**[Trump is not trying to court the traditional constituencies of
Washington]{.underline}**. **[So he has no need for
people]{.underline}**, like Priebus and Spicer in particular, **[whose
main credentials are their establishment ties]{.underline}**. From his
RNC tenure, Priebus had deep relationships with the GOP establishment in
Washington, including his longtime friend and fellow Wisconsin native,
House Speaker Paul Ryan. (Ryan, a day before Priebus's removal became
public, told reporters on Capitol Hill, "Reince is doing a fantastic job
at the White House and I believe he has the president's confidence."
Spicer had been a spokesman in the Bush administration, on Capitol Hill
and at the RNC, with extensive contacts with Beltway reporters. Kelly, a
Marine, had spent virtually his entire career in the military before
taking the Homeland Security post. His lack of experience working on
Capitol Hill or in the White House fits well with an administration that
doesn't value those skills. **[One wing that is struggling The McCain
Wing]{.underline}** --- Similar to the Party Wing, the McCain Wing2 of
the Trump administration --- particularly
general-turned-national-security-adviser H.R. McMaster and
general-turned-defense-secretary Jim Mattis --- **[has declining power
because Trump is not following the edicts of the Washington Republican
foreign policy establishment]{.underline}**. Trump's moves on Russia ---
downplaying the election hacking, exploring the lifting of U.S.
sanctions, trying to build closer ties with Vladimir Putin --- are not
the kinds of policies that the generals favored before they entered the
administration. This is a problem if you are serving as a top Trump
foreign policy adviser. So when Trump met with Putin at the G-20 summit
earlier this month, McMaster was not included in either the formal
meeting or an informal session the two leaders had later.3 It's not
clear that McMaster and Mattis want Trump to follow through on his
campaign pledge to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. So the
president, according to Foreign Policy, has tasked a different set of
staffers to present him with a path for leaving the agreement.
Additionally, the Pentagon seemed to be blindsided by Trump's tweets
last week that he wanted to ban transgender people from serving in the
military. It was not clear that Mattis supported such a ban. It will be
interesting to see how Kelly's ascension affects Mattis and McMaster. On
the one hand, Kelly, before he joined the Trump administration, was
fairly skeptical of Russia and Putin as well. So he could be another
voice pushing the president toward a more confrontational relationship
with Putin, like Mattis, McMaster and congressional leaders in both
parties. On the other hand, the chief of staff role is traditionally
defined as executing the president's agenda, even more than other top
government posts. If Trump now has in Kelly a top aide with military
experience who will endorse his more unorthodox stands on foreign
policy, particularly toward Russia, the president could be even more
eager to reject the advice of Mattis and McMaster. Stay tuned here, the
role of Kelly on foreign policy could be very interesting. The three
wings maintaining power (but not gaining more) The Friends and Family
Wing --- Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have convinced the
president of at least one thing: the value of their being untouchable,
powerful advisers, in a way no presidential daughter and son-in-law have
ever been in modern times. And the swapping in of Scaramucci --- a New
York finance person with no previous government experience (like Ivanka
Trump and Kushner) --- for D.C. insider Spicer is another power grab for
this wing. Ivanka Trump and Kushner reportedly favored the move. On the
other hand, it is hard to see this wing's influence on policy. If Ivanka
Trump really wanted her father to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate
deal, as was reported, she did not succeed. Her proposal for a national
paid family leave program has little momentum on Capitol Hill. The
Bannon Wing --- Bannon and Sessions were two of the architects of the
nationalist parts of Trump's campaign platform. But in the spring,
Kushner and Bannon were warring internally, and the president downplayed
his relationship with Bannon. Recently, the president has publicly
complained about Sessions for recusing himself from the Justice
Department's investigation of ties between Trump campaign officials and
Russia and for allowing the appointment of a special counsel. So, at
first glance, it would appear that the nationalist wing of Trumpworld is
in decline, since the status of Bannon and Sessions has been in
question. But the ideas of the Bannon-Sessions wing are flourishing,
even if the two men are not personally. Trump remained behind the travel
ban on people from certain Muslim-majority nations, even after courts
kept issuing rulings against it. That steadfast defense of the policy
was rewarded when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated part of the
executive order enacting it. Sessions is implementing hardline
immigration and criminal justice policies at the Department of Justice,
and Kelly, in his DHS role, was aggressive about defending the
administration's right to deport undocumented immigrants. And Bannon
urged Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate deal, which Trump has
said he will do. Why are these ideas still carrying the day in the Trump
administration? You could argue that even if Bannon's and Sessions's
stocks are down, nationalist views have advocates all over the
administration. But the most important reason that these views and those
who champion them have lots of power is that the president appears to
agree with them. The Wall Street Wing --- Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and other
traditional economic figures were expected to push Trump away from the
more unusual positions that he took during the campaign, when he
proposed withdrawing from NAFTA and labeling China a currency
manipulator. He has not taken either of those steps. So from that
perspective, the Wall Street Wing has accomplished what the McCain Wing
had hoped to do: have Trump govern more like a traditional Republican on
their issues. But they have not fully turned him around: Trump is
arguably more opposed to multi-country free-trade agreements than any
recent American president. The two wings gaining power (probably because
of Trump's Russia problem) The Bureaucrats --- Special Counsel Robert
Mueller, who is in charge of the DOJ investigation of Russia's
interference in the 2016 campaign and whether there are any connections
between that interference and Trump allies, is probably not who you
think of when you think of a bureaucrat. But he occupies a major post in
government, and he wasn't put there by Trump --- and those are the types
of people this wing encompasses. The most important conflict in
Washington right now is Mueller v. Trump, since Trump seems to want the
Russia investigation to stop and firing Sessions or Mueller might be a
route to accomplishing that goal. It's not exactly clear who is leaking
to major newspapers like The New York Times the connections of Kushner,
Sessions and others in Trump's orbit to Russian figures. But many of the
news accounts of these connections are often attributed to unnamed "U.S.
officials," suggesting that these are people inside the government. The
people who are leaking this information that fuels the Russia-Trump
stories have a lot of power at the moment because it's keeping that
issue in the minds of the public and irritating Trump. **[The Pence Wing
--- If you look at policy, the traditional conservative wing of the
Trump administration]{.underline}**, led by the vice president, **[is
winning like no other]{.underline}**. Trump, despite little record of
opposing abortion before his 2016 presidential campaign, has enacted or
is pushing a number of provisions aimed at either reducing the number of
abortions or cutting funding for Planned Parenthood. **[His budget reads
like it was written at the offices of the deeply conservative Heritage
Foundation, full of cuts to government programs]{.underline}**. Trump's
proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military was another
policy advocated by social conservatives, including Vice President Mike
Pence, according to reports. The secret sauce of this wing is probably
Russia. **[Trump]{.underline}**, during his campaign, **[took positions
on some issues that were distinct from the rest of the Republican Party,
at one point suggesting that he opposed efforts to cut Medicaid
funding]{.underline}**. **[But the Russia scandal has in some ways
heightened the president's need for loyalty from congressional
Republicans and the GOP base. They can save him]{.underline}** from more
investigations and potentially impeachment and removal from office**[.
He appears to have traded policy for party loyalty, largely enacting the
agenda of party activists and more conservative figures like
Pence.]{.underline}**

#### Base key but support not resilient --[most robust]{.underline} theory proves the link true

**Walsh 17.** \[David, PhD candidate in political science at Rutgers
University, "Yes, Trump will face a backlash if he doesn't deliver on
his promises" Washington Post \-- Jan. 20 \--

**[Trump's penchant for sweeping promises]{.underline}** --- and the
likelihood that he may have trouble keeping them --- **[has Republicans
concerned about what would happen if he doesn't or can't follow
through]{.underline}**. "If we're given the White House and both houses
of Congress and we don't deliver," Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said recently, "I
think **[there will be pitchforks and torches in the
streets]{.underline}**." Although Cruz's vision of a violent uprising
may be an exaggeration, my research suggests that **[Trump would indeed
face a backlash if he fails to deliver on key promises]{.underline}**.
\[Will Trump follow through on all his Day One promises? Doesn't look
like it.\] **[Losses outweigh gains in the human mind]{.underline}**.
What does that mean for politics? **[That conclusion rests on one of the
most robust theories of modern psychology]{.underline}**, prospect
theory. **[Prospect theory argues that in our minds, perceived losses
outweigh perceived gains in ways that profoundly affect our
decision-making.]{.underline}** **[In a political
context]{.underline}**, this means that **[when the president surprises
you by doing something you like, you're happy about it. But that
happiness is not nearly as powerful as]{.underline}** the
d**[isappointment]{.underline}** --- or even **[sadness or anger ---
that you experience when the president does something you
hate]{.underline}**. One implication is that **[the backlash a president
faces for breaking a promise to his supporters may be much stronger than
whatever positive reactions come from voters who are pleasantly
surprised by his decision not to pursue that campaign
pledge]{.underline}**. **[For Trump, a shift away from some of the
radical positions he has staked out may in fact please even a majority
of Americans. But]{.underline}** **[any positive reaction will likely be
muted, while the disappointment of his original supporters will be
amplified]{.underline}**. **[He could find himself losing some of his
supporters without picking up the same number from the other side ---
which could leave him even more unpopular than he already
is.]{.underline}**

#### Base support is the lynchpin of Trump's power. 

**Blake 8-8.** \[Aaron, senior political reporter, \"Trump's base is

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/08/08/trumps-base-is-officially-crumbling/?utm_term=.9779d5392915\]

But **[the most crucial numbers remain the approval ratings among
Republicans]{.underline}**. **[The president maintains sway over
congressional Republicans as long as GOP base voters remain firmly in
his camp. And holding that base has been Trump\'s entire political
strategy, with almost everything he does alienating 60-65 percent of
country but aiming to rally the base --- against the media, against the
establishment and often against long-established political
norms]{.underline}**. The president does something controversial, the
media jumps on it, Trump screams "fake news," and the base rallies.

#### Trump's base is key to his political power.

**Lauter 17.** \[David, Los Angeles Times' Washington bureau chief
"Trump has gotten even less popular while in office" LA Times \--
February 13 \--
<http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-polls-20170213-story.html>\]

Without question**[, Trump,]{.underline}** who won the presidency with a
minority of the votes cast**[, has retained a strong hold on his core
supporters, whose loyalty remains ardent. Republicans are more approving
of his personal qualities than they were in the fall, according to
several ratings. And Trump has plenty of time to turn around the current
negative trend in his overall ratings.]{.underline}** But the pattern is
consistent: After a brief increase in popularity early in his
transition, almost all public polls show a decline in Trump's support,
though the exact amount varies. In Gallup's surveys, Trump's job
approval has gone from an even split the week of his inauguration, with
45% of Americans approving and 45% disapproving, to a 10-point deficit
in the latest average, 42% to 52%. Gallup has tracked every American
president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and before Trump, none hit 50%
disapproval for months, sometimes years. Trump has fallen below all but
the lowest points for President Obama and into territory plumbed by
Harry Truman, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Asked about specific
qualities of leadership, Americans in Gallup's surveys give Trump strong
marks for keeping his promises and being a "strong and decisive" leader.
But majorities rate him negatively on inspiring confidence, managing the
government effectively and being honest. On each of those measures, a
vast gulf separates the mostly positive views of Republicans from the
negative views of most Democrats. In addition to Gallup, other polls
showing a decline in Trump's job approval include a GOP favorite,
Rasmussen, which has shown Trump dropping from a 14-point net approval
rating when he started to four points now; YouGov, which has found a
13-point decline; and Quinnipiac, with a 17-point drop. Among major
nonpartisan surveys, the only one to depart from the pattern is the
Reuters/Ipsos poll, which had Trump's approval at a two-point deficit
when he started and now has him barely in positive territory, with 48%
approving and 47% disapproving. For now, **[what matters most to Trump
is holding the support of his core voters. That's key to his strength in
Congress, especially in the House, because his popularity remains high
in most Republican-held congressional districts. But if his decline
persists, it could weaken Trump's sway in the Senate]{.underline}**,
where members need to run statewide. Whether Trump's approval rating
will drop further depends largely on independents and Republicans --- he
has almost no support to lose among Democrats. If those voters do sour
on him, that could pose a threat to Republicans in the midterm election
in 2018. The incumbent president's approval rating historically serves
as a good predictor of how many seats his party will lose at midterm.
Most presidents lose ground during their first two years. The average
decline since World War II is just short of eight points, according to a
compilation by Marquette University political scientist Charles
Franklin. If Trump follows that pattern, he could end up with an
approval rating in the high 30s --- perilous territory for congressional
candidates running in swing districts.

#### Trump's base is key

**O'Reilly 17.** \[William F.B., staff @ Newsday, "Will Comey testimony
begin to crack Trump's base?" Newsday -- June 8 \--
http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/william-f-b-o-reilly/will-comey-testimony-begin-to-crack-trump-s-base-1.13715337)

It shouldn't matter how **[the president is perceived by his political
base]{.underline}**. But it **[means everything in
reality]{.underline}**: **[As long as Trump retains significant
grass-roots Republican support]{.underline}**, **[just 20 or 25
percent]{.underline}**, **[members of Congress won't break with him en
masse]{.underline}**. **[Doing so would spell political suicide for them
in 2018]{.underline}**, through primary challenges and/or Republicans
bass fishing instead of voting during the midterm elections (the same
may happen if this Congress can't pass tax reforms). **[Republican
support for Trump hovers at around 80 percent right now]{.underline}**,
with somewhere between a quarter and half of that hard core support.

#### Only the conservative base matter & it outweighs every turn -- Size, media, & money generate intensity & focus that opposition can't match

**Hacker & Pierson 15.** (Jacob, Stanley Resor Professor of Political
Science at Yale University, & Paul, John Gross Professor of Political
Science at the University of California, Berkeley, "No Cost for
Extremism", http://prospect.org/article/no-cost-extremism)

Conventional images of the two parties see them as symmetrical
reflections of each other. But when it comes to the activist core of the
parties, there is no comparison. **[The Republican base is larger, more
intense, better organized, and fueled by distinctive partisan media
outlets that make those on the other side look like pale
imitations]{.underline}**. Strong liberals are often motivated primarily
by one issue---the environment, say, or abortion, or minority rights.
**[Strong conservatives tend to describe themselves as part of a broad
effort to protect a way of life]{.underline}**. Even during the George
W. Bush presidency, liberals wanted Democratic Party leaders to take
moderate positions and expressed a strong desire for compromise.
**[Conservatives consistently indicate they want Republicans to take
more conservative positions and never, ever compromise with
opponents]{.underline}**. Not surprisingly, **[self-described
conservatives also show up when it counts]{.underline}**. Whatever the
form of participation---voting, working for candidates, contributing to
campaigns---the GOP base does more of it than any other group. At the
same time, **[the ideological distance between the party's most active
voters and the rest of the party's electorate is greater on the GOP side
than the Democratic side]{.underline}**. Democratic activists are
moderate as well as liberal (and occasionally even conservative).
Republican activists are much more consistently conservative, even
compared with other elements of the GOP electoral coalition.
Nonetheless, the imbalance in prevalence and intensity between
self-identified liberals and self-identified conservatives hasn't
changed much in 35 years---even as the role of the Republican base in
American politics has changed dramatically. Something has happened that
has given that base a greater weight and a greater focus on "Washington"
as the central threat to American society. Here, **[we need to turn our
attention from the GOP's most committed voters to the organized forces
that have jet-propelled the GOP's rightward trip]{.underline}**. Even
the most informed and active voters take their cues from organizations
and elite figures they trust. (Indeed, there's strong evidence that such
voters are most likely to process information through an ideological
lens.) The far right has built precisely the kind of organizations
needed to turn diffuse and generalized support into focused activity on
behalf of increasingly extreme candidates. Those organized forces have
two key elements: polarizing right-wing media and efforts by business
and the very wealthy to backstop and bankroll GOP politics. Pundits like
to point to surface similarities between partisan journalists on the
left and right, but the differences in scale and organization are
profound. **[The conservative side is massive;]{.underline}** describing
its counterpart on the left as modest would be an act of true
generosity.

President-elect Donald **[Trump built his campaign on
promises]{.underline}** to put a wall on the Mexican border, "utterly
destroy" the Islamic State, and accelerate economic growth to heights
never before seen outside of wartime. Days before he won the presidency,
Trump told his supporters he would give them "every dream you ever

**[Prospect theory argues that in our minds, perceived losses outweigh
perceived gains in ways that profoundly affect our
decision-making.]{.underline}** In a political context, this means that
**[when the president surprises you by doing something you like, you're
happy about it. But that happiness is not nearly as powerful
as]{.underline}** the disappointment --- or even **[sadness or anger ---
that you experience when the president does something you
hate]{.underline}**. One implication is that **[the backlash a president
faces for breaking a promise to his supporters may be much stronger than
whatever positive reactions come from voters who are pleasantly
surprised by his decision not to pursue that campaign
pledge]{.underline}**. For Trump, a shift away from some of the radical
positions he has staked out may in fact please even a majority of
Americans. But **[any positive reaction will likely be muted, while the
disappointment of his original supporters will be
amplified]{.underline}**. **[He could find himself losing some of his
supporters without picking up the same number from the other side ---
which could leave him even more unpopular than he already
is.]{.underline}**

#### Flip Flops erode the base- leads to backlash

John **Whitesides 2016** (Columnist at Reuters, "Supporters to Trump:
break campaign promises at your peril," November 11^th^,
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-promises/supporters-to-trump-break-campaign-promises-at-your-peril-idUSKBN1362AC)

After listening to his speeches and casting her vote for him, she
expects Trump to toughen immigration laws, restore lost jobs, upend a
corrupt political system, build a wall on the border, and be, as the
millionaire put it, the \"greatest jobs president that God has ever
created.\" \"**We expect him to move forward on all the items he has
promised to move forward on**,\" said Stellmack, 69, a retiree in West
Palm Beach, Florida. **[\"]{.underline}And if he doesn\'t, we will hold
his feet to the fire[.\"]{.underline}** After a presidential race fueled
by brash but constantly shifting policy proposals, **[Trump\'s millions
of followers \-- from social conservative activists to struggling
blue-collar workers to hardline militant groups \-- say if he does
anything less than take a wrecking ball to business-as-usual Washington,
they will be disappointed.]{.underline}** \"We\'ll be watching, Mr.
Trump,\" said Stellmack. Trump\'s promises have been hard to pin down,
with many policy details left elusive and vague. NBC News identified 141
\"distinct shifts\" on 23 major issues since Trump announced his
candidacy on June 16, 2015. Still, his fiery rhetoric had an
unmistakable message of ending big government and the entrenched power
of establishment elites in both parties. That inspired hope that Trump
can break through Washington\'s gridlock to make progress on plans to
invigorate the economy, eliminate terrorist threats, rip up trade
agreements and repeal President Barack Obama\'s healthcare plan known as
Obamacare. \"I totally trust him,\" said Laura Czarniak, 56, of
Manistee, Michigan, a Rust Belt state that leans Democrat in
presidential elections but which flipped to Trump on Tuesday. \"I know
he\'ll build the wall. I know he\'ll take care of the Syrian refugee
problem. I know he\'ll get rid of Obamacare. There is not a chance in
hell he won\'t do those things,\" she said. But even with Republicans
retaining control of Congress, Trump will have to accept limits and
compromises on some of his plans. Many Republicans, for example, are
wary of his proposals to scrap trade deals and boost spending on
infrastructure improvements. Some of his plans have already been rolled
back. Trump faces his highest expectations on the issue of immigration,
given his intense focus on attention-grabbing campaign proposals like
forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, and temporarily banning Muslims
from entering the country. But he recently indicated he would at first
deport only criminal undocumented immigrants, after previously pledging
to deport all undocumented aliens, while the Muslim ban has softened
into \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants from some countries. He told the
Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that he would consider
keeping parts of Obamacare intact \-- easing off his calls for a total
repeal \-- after Obama spoke to him on the issue at the White House on
Thursday. Mark Morris, a leader of the Colorado-based Three Percent
United Patriots militia group, said he understood Trump would need time
on some issues, but he expected quick movement on repealing Obamacare
and appointing a conservative Supreme Court justice to fill the seat of
the late Antonin Scalia. He said he hoped Trump would stand with
ranchers in their disputes with the federal government over fees charged
for cattle grazing on public land -- a call to arms for many in the
patriot and militia movement. Morris warned **[Trump should not count on
his followers to stay with him if he did not produce
results.]{.underline}** \"**[People voted with a lot of faith that he
will come through,\" he said. \"I don't think it is going to work out
very well if he doesn't get the things done and he comes back at the end
of four years and says I need four more years to accomplish what I need
to accomplish.\"]{.underline}**

#### Flip Flopping on key campaign promises, like the plan, causes backlash

David Hunter **Walsh 2017** (a PhD candidate in political science at
Rutgers University, and a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. "Yes, Trump
will face a backlash if he doesn't deliver on his promises," Jan 20^th^,

President-elect Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** **[built his campaign on
promises to put a wall on the Mexican border]{.underline}**, "utterly
destroy" the Islamic State, and accelerate economic growth to heights
never before seen outside of wartime. Days before he won the presidency,
Trump told his supporters he would give them "every dream you ever
dreamed for your country." **[Trump's penchant for sweeping promises ---
and the likelihood that he may have trouble keeping them --- has
Republicans concerned about what would happen if he doesn't or can't
follow through]{.underline}**. "If we're given the White House and both
houses of Congress and we don't deliver," Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said
recently, **["]{.underline}I think there will be pitchforks and torches
in the streets."** Although Cruz's vision of a violent uprising may be
an exaggeration, my research suggests that **[Trump would indeed face a
backlash if he fails to deliver on key promises.]{.underline}** **[That
conclusion rests on]{.underline}** one of the most robust **[theories of
modern psychology,]{.underline} prospect theory**. **[Prospect theory
argues that in our minds, perceived losses outweigh perceived gains in
ways that profoundly affect our decision-making.]{.underline}** In a
political context, **[this means that when the president surprises you
by doing something you like, you're happy about it. But that happiness
is not nearly as powerful as the disappointment]{.underline}** ---
**[or]{.underline}** even sadness or **[anger]{.underline}** --- **[that
you experience when the president does something you
hate]{.underline}**. **[One implication is that the backlash a president
faces for breaking a promise to his supporters may be much stronger than
whatever positive reactions come from voters who are pleasantly
surprised by his decision not to pursue that campaign pledge. For Trump,
a shift away from some of the radical positions he has staked out may in
fact please]{.underline}** even **[a majority of
Americans]{.underline}**. **But** **any positive reaction will likely be
muted, while the disappointment of his original supporters will be
amplified**. **[He]{.underline}** **[could find himself losing some of
his supporters without picking up the same number from the other side
--- which could leave him even more unpopular than he already
is.]{.underline}** Let's take Medicare, for example. Trump highlighted
his deviation from Republican orthodoxy by campaigning against cuts and
privatization. But his appointment of Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a
privatization champion, as Health and Human Services secretary suggests
he may be open to an overhaul. If Trump embraced privatization or
another significant reform, he could risk angering people who voted for
him and who like Medicare as it is. Assuming that most Americans expect
Trump to keep his promise not to fundamentally alter the program, those
who would approve (certainly nothing close to a supermajority) would
likely discount it as a gain, while opponents would view it as a loss.
The backlash could be stronger than the enthusiasm among backers of
privatization. Here's how I did my research **[Survey data from
the]{.underline}** American National Election Studies
(**[ANES]{.underline}**) **[help highlight this dynamic]{.underline}**.
Over various periods in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, the ANES repeatedly
asked the same people where they thought the president and presidential
candidates stood on a variety of issues. These people were also
repeatedly asked where they themselves stood on these issues, and how
they rated the president or candidate on a feeling thermometer. **[I
examined cases in which a president is perceived as shifting from a
slightly liberal position to a moderately conservative
one]{.underline}** on the issue of government services, analogous to a
potential Trump shift on Medicare. **[In those cases, liberals' negative
reactions are 77 percent stronger on average than conservatives'
positive reactions]{.underline}**; if liberals and conservatives were
equal in number and they all perceived such a shift, Trump's approval
rating would drop, by between 3.6 and 9.9 points as I have modeled it.
The only way a shift on Medicare would not harm Trump's approval rating
is if the public favored his policy by at least a 60-40 split. **[A
similar story is told by the data on most other issues, regardless of
the direction of the shift and from where the president is
moving]{.underline}**. A shift of moderate magnitude on defense spending
costs the president 7.4 points on average when the public is split on
the issue. On welfare policy, the average hit to a president's approval
is 9.2 points. **These are big league effects for just one policy
change. The consequences of disappointing a president's supporters can
be massive,** **while the positive reactions of voters he might be hope
to win over sometimes fail to register at all.** **[These "expectation
costs" are a result of having led the electorate to expect certain
policies that then shape how they evaluate future outcomes. It is
important to note that these effects cannot be explained by simultaneous
changes in the voter's opinion of the president due to other factors,
nor are they altered by media exposure or political knowledge. So long
as the individual has a consistent opinion on the issue and does
perceive the president as being inconsistent on it, this costly dynamic
appears inescapable.]{.underline}**

#### Base support relies on keeping his promises -- but its not inevitable 

David **Lauter 2017** (LA Times Chief, "Trump has gotten even less
popular while in office," LA Times, Feb 13^th^,
http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-polls-20170213-story.html)

**[One of the enduring myths of [President
Trump](http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html)'s
political career is the belief that "nothing matters" --- that the
controversies that surround him have no effect on his standing with the
public.]{.underline}** The three weeks since **[Trump's]{.underline}**
inauguration have once again proven that untrue: Trump has lost
significant ground in public approval in the aftermath of a rough start.
Without question, Trump, who won the presidency with a minority of the
votes cast, has **[retained a strong hold on his core supporters, whose
loyalty remains ardent.
[Republicans](http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/republican-party-ORGOV0000004-topic.html)
are more approving of his personal qualities than they were in the
fall]{.underline}**, according to several ratings. And Trump has plenty
of time to turn around the current negative trend in his overall
ratings. But the pattern is consistent: After a brief increase in
popularity early in his transition, almost all public polls show a
decline in Trump's support, though the exact amount varies. In Gallup's
surveys, Trump's job approval has gone from an even split the week of
his inauguration, with 45% of Americans approving and 45% disapproving,
to a 10-point deficit in the latest average, 42% to 52%. Gallup has
tracked every American president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and before
Trump, none hit 50% disapproval for months, sometimes years. Trump has
fallen below all but the lowest points for President Obama and into
territory plumbed by Harry Truman, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Asked
about specific qualities of leadership, **[Americans in Gallup's surveys
give Trump strong marks for keeping his promises and being a "strong and
decisive" leader.]{.underline}** But majorities rate him negatively on
inspiring confidence, managing the government effectively and being
honest. On each of those measures, a vast gulf separates the mostly
positive views of Republicans from the negative views of most Democrats.
In addition to Gallup, other polls showing a decline in Trump's job
approval include a GOP favorite, Rasmussen, which has shown Trump
dropping from a 14-point net approval rating when he started to four
points now; YouGov, which has found a 13-point decline; and Quinnipiac,
with a 17-point drop. Among major nonpartisan surveys, the only one to
depart from the pattern is the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which had Trump's
approval at a two-point deficit when he started and now has him barely
in positive territory, with 48% approving and 47% disapproving. **[For
now, what matters most to Trump is holding the support of his core
voters. That's key to his strength]{.underline}** in
Congress**[,]{.underline}** especially in the House, because his
popularity remains high in most Republican-held congressional
districts**[. But if his decline persists, it could weaken Trump's sway
in the Senate, where members need to run statewide. Whether Trump's
approval rating will drop further depends largely on]{.underline}**
independents and **[Republicans --- ]{.underline}**he has almost no
support to lose among Democrats. If those voters do sour on him, that
could pose a threat to Republicans in the midterm election in 2018. The
incumbent president's approval rating historically serves as a good
predictor of how many seats his party will lose at midterm.

### Liberal Policies

#### Liberal policy endorsements triggers GOP backlash\-\--wrecks his popularity with the grassroots

**Zurcher 16.** \[Anthony, US analyst @ BBC, "Trump: Five political
minefields facing president-elect" BBC \-- December 7 \--
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38227937\]

The new president will have formidable assets at his disposal. **[The
chief executive has broad unilateral powers, and his party controls both
chambers of Congress. As long as Republicans stay unified, they will be
able to advance a broad range of conservative priorities]{.underline}**
that have been on the back-burner for more than a decade. **[The
danger]{.underline}**, however, **[is that they could choose a losing
battle - or a winning one whose victory comes at too high a
price]{.underline}**. **[The history books are littered with presidents
whose electoral mandates crumbled in the early days of their
presidency.]{.underline}** Barack **[Obama and Democrats saw their large
governing majorities]{.underline}** in 2009 **[vanish]{.underline}** two
years later **[after a bruising fight to pass healthcare
reform]{.underline}**. A push for universal healthcare also cost Bill
Clinton dearly in 1993. George HW Bush\'s presidency ran aground, in
part, due to tax concessions he made to Democrats in the 1990 budget
negotiations. Ronald **[Reagan\'s tax reforms early in his presidency
sank his approval ratings]{.underline}** before an economic recovery
changed his fortunes. **[As]{.underline}** Mr **[Trump looks ahead to
his presidency, there are countless opportunities - but the path to
success is a veritable minefield, where one false step could lead to
ruin.]{.underline}** Here\'s a look at five particularly dangerous
potential pitfalls. Medicare privatisation Donald Trump campaigned on
repealing Barack Obama\'s healthcare reform programme, and the
Republican Congress seems eager to follow through (timeline to be
determined, of course). What Mr Trump didn\'t campaign on, and yet
congressional Republican leadership seems enamoured with, was any kind
of modification or privatisation of the government-run healthcare
programme for the elderly, Medicare. In fact, Mr Trump was quite clear
that he wouldn\'t touch the social safety net that provides retirement
and medical care for the poor, disabled and elderly. \"Every Republican
wants to do a big number on Social Security, they want to do it on
Medicare, they want to do it on Medicaid,\" candidate Trump said at a
Republican forum in 2015. \"And it\'s not fair to the people that have
been paying in for years and now all of the sudden they want to be
cut.\" Yet changing Medicare from a government-run, single-payer
programme to a state-managed voucher-backed premium support system has
long been a goal of House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"Medicare has got some
serious problems because of Obamacare,\" Mr Ryan said a few days after
Mr Trump was elected. \"Those things are part of our plan to replace
Obamacare.\" Mr Ryan is the leader of a segment of conservatives who
view Medicare as a means of fostering dependence on government - a
fortified expansion of centralised power that presents a growing
financial burden on the federal budget. The challenge for Republicans,
however, is that, unlike the heavily politicised Obamacare reforms,
Medicare is immensely popular. A 2015 poll found 60% of Americans viewed
the programme as \"working well\", and 77% said the programme was \"very
important\". Back in 2004, newly re-elected President George W Bush and
a Republican-controlled Congress made a similar run at privatising
Social Security, the government-managed retirement programme. Those
efforts collapsed without so much as a legislative vote, thanks to
withering opposition from Democrats and a sceptical public. It marked
the beginning of Mr Bush\'s sharp decline in popularity that culminated
in sweeping Democratic victories in the 2006 mid-term elections and
President Obama in 2008. Ann Coulter, a fervent Trump backer, succinctly
summed up the shape of the pitfall that now may await her party.
\"Medicare IS NOT WHAT THE ELECTION WAS FOUGHT OVER,\" she tweeted. \"If
Ryan wants to change Medicare, then run for president on that and see
how far you get.\" Mind the mine: Misinterpreting your mandate for
change is classic post-election overreach danger. Tax cuts Although he
didn\'t regularly dwell on it at his campaign rallies, candidate Trump
had a fairly detailed tax-cut plan. Perhaps the reason for his reticence
was that the benefits - according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center -
would be showered primarily on the wealthy. The average tax cut was
pegged at \$2,940 per person, amounting to an after-tax income increase
of 4.1%. Those earning over \$3.7m, however, would receive a tax cut of
roughly \$1.1m, for an after-tax income boost of 14%. During the first
presidential debate, Hillary Clinton called this \"trumped up
trickle-down economics\" - the theory, first embraced by President
Ronald Reagan, that the benefits of tax cuts for the rich would
eventually filter onto the lower-income brackets through increased
spending. The label didn\'t stick (and was, in fact, mocked as being
forced), but the attacks may sting if they accompany hard figures in
legislation signed by the man who won the White House as a champion of
the working class. There\'s some sign that the forthcoming Trump
administration may already be backing away from this particular
political landmine - and heading toward a new one, instead. During a
recent interview Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin said that any
tax reform would be benefit-neutral for the wealthy. \"Any reductions we
have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions, so that
there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,\" he said. While
that sounds inoffensive, the two biggest individual tax deductions are
also two of the most beloved by the American middle class - for home
mortgage interest and charitable donations. Any politicians, Republican
or Democrat, touch those at their political peril. Mind the mine: Mr
Trump campaigned against a moneyed global elite. If they reap the
rewards of Republican tax reforms, he may lose some of his populist
lustre. Imperial overreach One of the ways Mr Trump framed himself as a
different kind of Republican presidential candidate was by condemning
his party\'s military adventurism. Where just a decade earlier his party
had marched in lockstep behind George W Bush in defending the Iraq War,
now Mr Trump stood on a Republican primary debate stage, condemned the
action as misguided and won. He said Libyan intervention was a mistake
and that the US should let Russia shoulder more of the military burden
in Syria. While he criticised Chinese trade practices, he said US allies
in Asia must shoulder more of the costs of their own defence. Positions
like these were largely why the Republican foreign policy establishment
abandoned the Trump campaign in droves and why the president-elect has
seemed hard-pressed to settle on a nominee for secretary of state. One
man already on the Trump White House team, however, is retired General
Michael Flynn - and he appears to support the kind of robust,
interventionist foreign policy that Mr Trump dismissed. In his recent
book, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical
Islam and Its Allies, the man who is tabbed to become Mr Trump\'s
national security adviser writes that the US is already fighting a
global war. \"We face a working coalition that extends from North Korea
and China to Russia, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela and
Nicaragua,\" he writes. \"We are under attack, not only from
nation-states directly, but also from Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Isis and
countless other terrorist groups.\" If Mr Flynn is joined on Mr Trump\'s
foreign policy team by someone like John Bolton - an Iraq War architect
whose name has been linked to the secretary of state job - President
Trump may be considerably more hawkish on foreign policy than Candidate
Trump ever was. Mind the mine: The American public will follow a
president into battle, but war is also an easy way to destroy a
presidency. Just ask George W Bush. Or Lyndon Johnson. Or Harry Truman.
Going rogue Mr Trump turned heads this week when he sat down with former
Democratic Vice-President Al Gore to discuss climate change and global
environmental issues. He shocked many of his conservative backers a few
weeks earlier when, after meeting with Mr Obama, he expressed support
for some portions of the president\'s healthcare reform. During the
campaign he unveiled a childcare and maternity leave proposal that, in
the words of conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, \"out-Democrats
the Democrats\". In other words, Mr **[Trump - who was a Democrat as
recently as 2009 - has shown a proclivity for entertaining issues and
positions that run counter to Republican orthodoxy]{.underline}**.
There\'s certainly an upside for being a president who\'s willing to
buck his own party and reach across the aisle for support. It was at the
heart of Bill Clinton\'s \"triangulation\" strategy during his
presidency, when he adopted and moderated popular Republican positions
on welfare reform and crime-fighting to boost his own standing. **[Such
a course comes with its own set of risks]{.underline}**, however,
**[particularly for someone like]{.underline}** Mr **[Trump. Embracing a
liberal position could jeopardise his Republican backing in Congress and
among the party\'s grass-roots supporters. Even with his best
efforts]{.underline}**, however, **[he will be hard-pressed to attract
much love from the political left.]{.underline}** **[His divisive
presidential campaign has made him too much of a villain among Democrats
for that to happen.]{.underline}** Mind the mine: **[Only Nixon could go
to China, as the saying goes.]{.underline}** Mr **[Trump could decide to
break the partisan logjam and advance a popular progressive priority.
Then again, when Nixon became mired in scandal, he was left with few
Republican allies to protect him. It\'s not a happy place for a
president to be]{.underline}**.

#### Plan's compromise with the left causes base backlash

Will **Rhan 2017** (Managing Editor for CBS Politics, \"Commentary: What
is Trump\'s way forward?,\" CBS News,
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-what-is-trumps-way-forward/)

**[Trump\'s approval ratings hover somewhere in the mid
thirties,]{.underline}** although Wall Street is quite happy with his
performance, what with his embrace of regulatory reform and a (still
theoretical) tax cut for top earners. **[But Trump wasn\'t elected to
please Wall Street and the Gary Cohns of the world.]{.underline}** **[He
was supposed to be a populist,]{.underline}** yet the only populism
we\'ve seen so far comes in the form of the flighty symbolism of travel
bans and exiting treaties. **[So why not a firmer populist
approach,]{.underline}** **[one that produces real results for the
Middle Americans who form Trump\'s base?]{.underline}** Well, there are
problems with this strategy, too. The first is that populist economics,
and the state intervention it requires, would need bipartisan support.
Domenech theorizes that, by giving left-wing Democrats like Bernie
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren more concessions than any normal Republican
president would, Trump could refashion the health-care bill into
something more workable and more likely to be passed. Since Trump has
few options at this point when it comes to health care, it might be wise
for the White House to heed this advice. But broadly speaking,
bipartisanship in the Trump era is a risky proposition. Obviously Trump
is hated by the liberal grassroots, and any Democrat mulling a 2020 run,
which is at this point might be a majority of Democratic lawmakers in
Washington, would need a lot of courage to embrace any proposal arising
from this administration, regardless of how moderate or populist it
seems. Democratic voters want obstructionism on a massive scale, so for
your average progressive politician, there\'s very little incentive to
work at all with Trump. The second thing to consider is how much
**[Trump relies on his right flank right now. The GOP leadership in
Congress doesn\'t like him and doesn\'t really want to defend him. The
calculus is different, however, from more hardcore conservatives who
represent districts that went overwhelmingly for Trump. Their voters
like Trump, therefore they like Trump, and feel obliged to defend him
and help him. At the same time, this right flank would be opposed to any
ideological adventurism.]{.underline}** **[They don\'t want tariffs and
New Deal-esque work programs and all the other things Steve Bannon was
fantasizing about]{.underline}** in the halcyon days after the election.
And, as a group, **[Trump probably can\'t afford to lose
them]{.underline}** **[-- look at the trouble they already caused in the
health care fight]{.underline}**. **[He needs to keep the right in his
corner,]{.underline}** **[particularly should the Russia matter explode
and impeachment starts looking like a real possibility]{.underline}**.
It would seem, then, that **[the most plausible way forward for
Trump,]{.underline} given [both the political realities of the moment
and his own personal idiosyncrasies, is to just keep doing what he\'s
been doing.]{.underline}** Call it the Jake LaMotta strategy -- **[take
the punishment, remain standing]{.underline}**, **[attack viciously at
every opportunity, and exhaust your opponents.]{.underline}**
**[Trump\'s fans want him to fight with Washington,]{.underline}**
**[and regardless of whether his wins or loses, they\'ll cheer if he
keeps taking and delivering blows.]{.underline}** You never got me down,
Schumer! Would this be sustainable? It\'s hard to think it would be, at
least in the long run. But **[it\'s]{.underline}** also
**[extraordinarily difficult to think of plausible
alternatives.]{.underline}** At this point, Trump\'s fortunes may
entirely rely on Democratic incompetence rather than some kind of pivot.
That\'s not a great place to be, but **[given the recent track record of
America\'s center-left party, it just might be enough to keep him in
office.]{.underline}**

the beginning of Mr Bush\'s sharp decline in popularity that culminated
in sweeping Democratic victories in the 2006 mid-term elections and
President Obama in 2008. Ann Coulter, a fervent Trump backer, succinctly
summed up the shape of the pitfall that now may await her party.
\"Medicare IS NOT WHAT THE ELECTION WAS FOUGHT OVER,\" she tweeted. \"If
Ryan wants to change Medicare, then run for president on that and see
how far you get.\" Mind the mine: Misinterpreting your mandate for
change is classic post-election overreach danger. Tax cuts Although he
didn\'t regularly dwell on it at his campaign rallies, candidate Trump
had a fairly detailed tax-cut plan. Perhaps the reason for his reticence
was that the benefits - according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center -
would be showered primarily on the wealthy. The average tax cut was
pegged at \$2,940 per person, amounting to an after-tax income increase
of 4.1%. Those earning over \$3.7m, however, would receive a tax cut of
roughly \$1.1m, for an after-tax income boost of 14%. During the first
presidential debate, Hillary Clinton called this \"trumped up
trickle-down economics\" - the theory, first embraced by President
Ronald Reagan, that the benefits of tax cuts for the rich would
eventually filter onto the lower-income brackets through increased
spending. The label didn\'t stick (and was, in fact, mocked as being
forced), but the attacks may sting if they accompany hard figures in
legislation signed by the man who won the White House as a champion of
the working class. There\'s some sign that the forthcoming Trump
administration may already be backing away from this particular
political landmine - and heading toward a new one, instead. During a
recent interview Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin said that any
tax reform would be benefit-neutral for the wealthy. \"Any reductions we
have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions, so that
there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,\" he said. While
that sounds inoffensive, the two biggest individual tax deductions are
also two of the most beloved by the American middle class - for home
mortgage interest and charitable donations. Any politicians, Republican
or Democrat, touch those at their political peril. Mind the mine: Mr
Trump campaigned against a moneyed global elite. If they reap the
rewards of Republican tax reforms, he may lose some of his populist
lustre. Imperial overreach One of the ways Mr Trump framed himself as a
different kind of Republican presidential candidate was by condemning
his party\'s military adventurism. Where just a decade earlier his party
had marched in lockstep behind George W Bush in defending the Iraq War,
now Mr Trump stood on a Republican primary debate stage, condemned the
action as misguided and won. He said Libyan intervention was a mistake
and that the US should let Russia shoulder more of the military burden
in Syria. While he criticised Chinese trade practices, he said US allies
in Asia must shoulder more of the costs of their own defence. Positions
like these were largely why the Republican foreign policy establishment
abandoned the Trump campaign in droves and why the president-elect has
seemed hard-pressed to settle on a nominee for secretary of state. One
man already on the Trump White House team, however, is retired General
Michael Flynn - and he appears to support the kind of robust,
interventionist foreign policy that Mr Trump dismissed. In his recent
book, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical
Islam and Its Allies, the man who is tabbed to become Mr Trump\'s
national security adviser writes that the US is already fighting a
global war. \"We face a working coalition that extends from North Korea
and China to Russia, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela and
Nicaragua,\" he writes. \"We are under attack, not only from
nation-states directly, but also from Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Isis and
countless other terrorist groups.\" If Mr Flynn is joined on Mr Trump\'s
foreign policy team by someone like John Bolton - an Iraq War architect
whose name has been linked to the secretary of state job - President
Trump may be considerably more hawkish on foreign policy than Candidate
Trump ever was. Mind the mine: The American public will follow a
president into battle, but war is also an easy way to destroy a
presidency. Just ask George W Bush. Or Lyndon Johnson. Or Harry Truman.
Going rogue Mr Trump turned heads this week when he sat down with former
Democratic Vice-President Al Gore to discuss climate change and global
environmental issues. He shocked many of his conservative backers a few
weeks earlier when, after meeting with Mr Obama, he expressed support
for some portions of the president\'s healthcare reform. During the
campaign he unveiled a childcare and maternity leave proposal that, in
the words of conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, \"out-Democrats
the Democrats\". In other words, Mr **[Trump - who was a Democrat as
recently as 2009 - has shown a proclivity for entertaining issues and
positions that run counter to Republican orthodoxy]{.underline}**.
There\'s certainly an upside for being a president who\'s willing to
buck his own party and reach across the aisle for support. It was at the
heart of Bill Clinton\'s \"triangulation\" strategy during his
presidency, when he adopted and moderated popular Republican positions
on welfare reform and crime-fighting to boost his own standing. **[Such
a course comes with its own set of risks]{.underline}**, however,
**[particularly for someone like]{.underline}** Mr
**[Trump.]{.underline} Embracing a liberal position could jeopardise his
Republican backing in Congress and among the party\'s grass-roots
supporters. Even with his best efforts,** however, **he will be
hard-pressed to attract much love from the political
left[.]{.underline}** **[His divisive presidential campaign has made him
too much of a villain among Democrats for that to happen.]{.underline}**
Mind the mine: **[Only Nixon could go to China, as the saying
goes.]{.underline}** Mr **[Trump could decide to break the partisan
logjam and advance a popular progressive priority. Then
again,]{.underline} when Nixon became mired in scandal, he was left with
few Republican allies to protect him. [It\'s not a happy place for a
president to be]{.underline}**.

## Impacts

### Diversionary War -- AT: Advisors Check

#### Bolton encourages Trump to make aggressive decisions ― that escalates 

**Dreher 18** (3/23, Rod, American Conservative Senior Editor "John
Bolton: Dog of War", American Conservative,
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/john-bolton-dog-of-war-trump/)

Like TAC's Daniel Larison, Damon Linker says **[we should all be
very]{.underline}**, **[very]{.underline}** **[worried about the John
Bolton appointment]{.underline}**. Excerpt: **[Having a man who so
consistently]{.underline}** --- one might almost say instinctually
**[--- favors military action serving as the national security adviser
to the president would be dangerous in any White House. But in the Trump
administration it could be catastrophic]{.underline}**. **[Trump is
utterly ignorant of the world, prone to making impulsive decisions, and
tends to defer to the most forceful voice in the room]{.underline}**,
especially when it conveys information with confident bluster. That
would give Bolton enormous power to shape policy --- which means the
power to get the United States to launch big new wars as well as expand
the numerous ones we're already waging across wide swaths of the Middle
East, Africa, and South Asia. One of those wars (in
**[Iraq]{.underline}**) **[was launched by a]{.underline}**nother
**[president lacking foreign policy experience who deferred to the hawks
in the room]{.underline}** (Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld), who combined
paranoia about threats with absurdly optimistic prognostications about
the efficacy of using American bombs to shape the future course of the
region. **[It ended up destabilizing]{.underline}** much of **[the
Middle East]{.underline}**. Eight years later **[another inexperienced
president deferred to his hawkish advisers]{.underline}** (Hillary
Clinton, Susan Rice, Samantha Powers) **[in launching another war (in
Libya]{.underline}**) on the basis of an overly sanguine assessment of
the likely consequences. It ended up **[destabilizing]{.underline}**
much of **[North Africa. Both]{.underline}** acts of destabilization
have led to enormous refugee flows from those areas of the world to
Europe, where they have **[helped to provoke a right-wing
populist-nationalist reaction that is transforming politics in an
anti-liberal direction across the European Union.]{.underline}** Are we
really supposed to believe that the results of putting John Bolton in a
senior advisory position from which he could persuade President Trump to
launch wars against North Korea and Iran would have less disastrous
consequences for the United States and the world? If the stakes weren't
so high, the suggestion might be considered a punchline. Jim Antle gets
straight to the point: Fifteen years after the invasion of Iraq, a
Republican president who called the war a "big, fat mistake" has named
one of its leading proponents as his national security adviser. **[If
one wanted to make the case that U.S. policymakers have learned little
from their biggest foreign-policy blunder of the past two decades, John
Bolton's appointment would be Exhibit A.]{.underline}** Bolton, set to
take the job in April from current national security adviser H.R.
McMaster after Trump tweeted the news on Thursday night, played an
important role in shaping prewar intelligence and seems to be itching
for a repeat elsewhere. I'll never forget the moment that I first
thought Donald Trump would be an improvement over any other Republican
possibility for president: when, in the South Carolina GOP debate, he
said from the stage that the Iraq War was a mistake. It had taken 13
years for a major GOP presidential candidate (I'm excluding Ron Paul) to
state the bleeding obvious, but Trump did. One big point in favor of
voting for him, from my point of view, was that he would be more
realistic and less belligerent on foreign policy than Hillary Clinton.
And now he has appointed the worst possible Republican on matters of war
as his national security adviser. Antle is right: **[the Republican
Party establishment has learned nothing from the Iraq
disaster]{.underline}**. Andrew Sullivan foresees worse to come. I wish
I didn't think he was right about this: And then last night, we saw
McMaster fall on his sword, replaced by John Bolton, an unrepentant
architect of the most disastrous war since Vietnam, a fanatical advocate
for regime change in Iran, an anti-Muslim extremist, and a believer in
the use of military force as if it were a religion. And this, of course,
is also part of the second phase for Plato's tyrant: war. "As his first
step, he is always setting some war in motion, so that people will be in
need of a leader," Plato explains. In fact, "**[it's necessary for a
tyrant always to be stirring up war]{.underline}**." Trump somewhat
confused us on this score at first, because of his contempt for the
Bushes and the Iraq War and his use of the term "America First." For
many excited (but utterly conned) conservative realists, he seemed to be
returning to an older Republican non-interventionism. But of course, we
now realize that **[his campaign screeds against the Iraq War were just
his strategy to take out Jeb Bush and appeal to middle America; and that
"America First" can]{.underline}** also **[mean pure nationalist
aggression overseas. And everything we know about Trump's character
tells us that war is probably the only aspect of foreign relations he
intuitively understands]{.underline}**. He cannot exist as an equal
party in an international system. **[He has to dominate other countries
the way he does other human beings]{.underline}**. And, when you look
back, you see this has been obvious all along.
**[Sullivan]{.underline}** acknowledges his own weakness for
"catastrophism" (a trait I share with him), but **[lays out a plausible
scenario in which a cornered Trump launches a war in an attempt to shore
up his presidency]{.underline}**. **[Who in the Republican Party would
dare to try to stop him]{.underline}**? There's only one Rand Paul. Do
you think that **[the American people would rally]{.underline}** against
the prospect of a Trump war? I don't. Some would, but it would be very
easy to manipulate many to rally **[behind the president]{.underline}**
**[against]{.underline}** (manufactured) **[threats from
abroad]{.underline}**. It happened before. I would have thought it not
possible to happen again, not so soon anyway, but I **[think a large
number of Americans will rally around Trump]{.underline}**, no matter
what. Where is the constituency within the GOP base for realism, for
restraint? Does anyone really believe that **[Trump is]{.underline}**
not **[capable of doing anything to save himself --- even launching a
war]{.underline}**?

#### Advisors don't check Trump lashout\-\--he's free to act unilaterally, and they sanction his nationalist and militaristic tendencies

Aaron **Miller 17**, vice president for new initiatives at foreign
policy and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International
Center for Scholars. With Richard Sokolsky, a nonresident senior fellow
in Carnegie's Russia and Eurasia Program. 6/20/17, "Why Trump's Foreign
Policy Can't Be Stopped"
http://carnegieendowment.org/2017/06/20/why-trump-s-foreign-policy-can-t-be-stopped-pub-71330

Still, for the most part, President [Trump is a]{.underline} relatively
[free agent to shape the optics and substance of his administration's
foreign policy]{.underline}, for good or ill. [Take his most recent trip
abroad. In a scant nine days, the president invested Saudi Arabia as the
focal point of his Middle East strategy and re-energized the U.S.-Saudi
relationship through hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of intended
arms sales and investment ventures.]{.underline} And that was just for
starters. [Trump went on to deliver an anti-Iranian message that
exacerbated tensions within the **G**ulf **C**ooperation **C**ouncil and
made more difficult the task of putting his anti-Islamic State coalition
together]{.underline}; tweeted his preference for taking Saudi Arabia's
side in its conflict with Qatar, further inflaming the crisis; made
clear that human rights have no serious place in his Middle East agenda;
became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in
Jerusalem; offended and [insulted European allies on issues including
climate change, trade, and defense spending]{.underline}; [and
blindsided his advisors when he failed to]{.underline} explicitly
[reaffirm America's commitment to NATO's mutual defense
guarantee]{.underline}.

[And all this in a mere nine days]{.underline}. Whether any of this
reflects a coherent strategy isn't really the point. [The larger
takeaway is that the president **can act unilaterally**]{.underline} ---
as his withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord reveals --- [with
devastating strategic consequences]{.underline}. There are issues,
specifically dealing with Russia, where the current domestic controversy
will certainly constrain Trump. Indeed, it's hard to imagine in these
circumstances lifting sanctions on Vladimir Putin or playing footsy with
him on any significant or sensitive issue. But on most political issues,
and perhaps also [when it comes to projecting American military
power]{.underline} abroad, [there are few if any
constraints]{.underline} [to stop him]{.underline}.

HIS ADVISORS GIVE HIM COVER AND LEGITIMACY

[The appointment of]{.underline} several experienced hands in the ways
of government and the world --- Secretary of Defense James
[Mattis]{.underline}, National Security Advisor H.R.
[McMaster]{.underline}, Secretary of State Rex [Tillerson,
and]{.underline} Homeland Security Secretary John [Kelly]{.underline}
--- [might have a leavening effect]{.underline} on a volatile and
inexperienced president. And although we don't know what Trump's foreign
policy would look like if these experienced operators were not around,
[it's clear that]{.underline} on issues that are important to the
president --- for example, climate change and turning NATO's Article 5
into a bargaining chip rather than a commitment --- **[they have not
been able to restrain him]{.underline}**. Indeed, on far too many issues
these [advisors seem willing to play along with if not endorse Trump's
self-consciously **self-centered nationalism.** This White House
operates on the premise that nations do not have a stake in cooperating
to solve problems they cannot solve by themselves or in one another's
success; instead, Trump lives in a **Darwinian dog-eat-dog world** where
America needs to look to its own interests and cut the best deals it can
--- allies and adversaries be damned]{.underline} (perhaps minus Putin).
When [two presumed moderates in the administration --- chief economic
advisor Gary Cohn and McMaster --- basically **said as much in a
recent** Wall Street Journal **op-ed**, they gave legitimacy to this
deeply flawed view.]{.underline}

#### Defense is wrong -- no checks

Bruce **Blair 16**, Nuclear security expert, Research scholar at the
Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University\',
6/11/2016, What Exactly Would It Mean to Have Trump's Finger on the
Nuclear Button?, Politico,
http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-missiles-nukes-button-launch-foreign-policy-213955

To a degree we haven't seen, perhaps, since the candidacy of Senator
Barry Goldwater in 1964, **[the question of Donald Trump's temperament
and judgment on matters of war and peace is stirring attention---and
trepidation, particularly when the subject of nuclear weapons comes
up]{.underline}**. Some people believe that Trump himself is the maniac,
the madman with nukes that appears in Trump's own worst nightmare. And
it's not just Trump's general-election opponent, Hillary Clinton, who's
hinting at this; his former GOP rival, Marco Rubio, repeated his earlier
concerns about Trump only this week, saying America can\'t give \"the
nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual.\" Others
would side with Trump's view that the weapons themselves---which pack a
destructive force amounting to "Hiroshima times a thousand," as he put
it---are the evil. But these points are not mutually exclusive.¶ **[What
would it mean to have Trump's fingers on the nuclear
button?]{.underline}** We don\'t really know, but we do know this: In
the atomic age, **[when decisions must be made very quickly, the
presidency has evolved into something akin to a nuclear
monarchy]{.underline}**. **[With a single phone call, the commander in
chief has virtually unlimited power to rain down nuclear weapons on any
adversarial regime and country at any time]{.underline}**. **[You might
imagine this awesome executive power would be hamstrung with checks and
balances]{.underline}**, but **[by]{.underline}** law, custom and
congressional **[deference there may be no responsibility where the
president has more absolute control.]{.underline}** There is no advice
and consent by the Senate. **[There is no second-guessing by the Supreme
Court]{.underline}**. Even ordering the use of torture---which Trump
infamously once said he would do, insisting the military "won't refuse.
They're not gonna refuse me"---imposes more legal constraints on a
president than ordering a nuclear attack.¶ **[If he were president,
Donald Trump---who likes to say he doesn\'t spend a lot of time
conferring with others]{.underline}** (\"My primary consultant is
myself,\" he declared in March**[)---would be free to launch a
civilization-ending nuclear war]{.underline}** **[on his own any time he
chose.]{.underline}**¶ The "nuclear button" is a metaphor for a complex
apparatus that has the president's brain at its apex. The image of a
commander in chief simply pressing a button captures none of the
machinery, people and procedures designed to inform the president and
translate his or her decisions into coherent action. Although it remains
shrouded in secrecy, we actually know a great deal about it, beginning
with the president's first task of opening the "nuclear suitcase" in an
emergency to review his nuclear attack options. **[If we shine our light
at the tactical and timing considerations of how a first- or
second-strike attack would unfold, and at the inner workings of the
nuclear decision process from the standpoint of the White House, we gain
a much better idea of a presidential candidate's fitness for this
responsibility. And here it is essential to consider a candidate's
temperament and character---especially in situations of extreme stress.
Decisiveness is important, but so is prudence.¶]{.underline}** Let us
say the president is awakened in the middle of the night (the proverbial
3 a.m. phone call) by his or her top nuclear adviser and told of an
incoming nuclear strike. Since the flight time of missiles fired from
launch stations in Russia or China to the White House is 30 minutes, and
12 minutes or less for missiles fired from submarines lurking in the
Western Atlantic Ocean (Russian subs historically favor a patrol area to
the west of Bermuda), **[the steadiness and brainpower of the commander
in chief in such circumstances are serious questions
inde]{.underline}**ed. The voting public must ask whether a given
candidate would remain calm---or panic, become discombobulated and
driven to order an immediate nuclear response on the basis of false
information.¶ This call has never happened, but if it ever does, the
situation would be as stressful and dangerous as things ever get inside
the Oval Office. The closest we came to such a call occurred in 1979,
when the consoles at our early warning hub in Colorado lit up with
indications of a large-scale Soviet missile attack. President Jimmy
Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, received
back-to-back calls in the middle of the night informing him of the
imminent nuclear destruction of the United States. The second call
reported an all-out attack. Brzezinski was seconds away from waking
Carter to pass on the dreadful news and convince him of the need to
order retaliation without delay (within a six-minute deadline).
Brzezinski was sure the end was near.¶ Just before he picked up the
phone to call Carter, Brzezinski received a third call, this time
canceling the alarm. It was a mistake caused by human and technical
error. A training tape simulating an all-out Soviet attack had
inadvertently slipped into the actual real-time attack early warning
network. The impending nuclear holocaust was a mirage that confused the
duty crew. (They were fired for taking eight minutes instead of the
required three minutes to declare their degree of confidence that an
attack against North America was underway.)¶ **[How would a President
Trump behave under such duress, informed of the attack and the imminent
destruction of the nation's capital and himself? He would have only a
few minutes to consider the reliability of the attack report and decide
whether and how to retaliate. If the attack is real, and he hesitates, a
president will likely be killed and the chain of command decapitated,
perhaps permanently. During the short countdown to impact, he also will
be advised by the head of the Strategic Command in Omaha]{.underline}**
(or the officer on duty that night if the four-star head of Strategic
Command cannot get onto the conference call on time) **[that the
incoming attack will destroy the bulk of the U.S. land-based strategic
missile force unless the president makes a timely decision ordering
their egress from their underground silos before incoming warheads
arrive.]{.underline}** Furthermore, he will hear that the loss of this
land-based force will mean that the goals of the U.S. war plan will not
be realizable. (These goals require the ability to destroy the vast bulk
of the Russia target base consisting of just under 1,000 aim points and
of the China target base of just under 500 aim points.)¶ **[Yet if the
president yields to this pressure and orders immediate retaliation, then
he risks launching on false warning.¶]{.underline}** Voters should want
to consider whether Trump or any other candidate possesses the steely
nerves and competence to deliberate intelligently and calmly at the
moment of truth. How does the candidate process ambiguity? Does he or
she interpret ambiguous or contradictory data in black-and-white terms
or in ways that reinforce his or her bias? Does the candidate rush to
conclusions? Does he or she appear to place too much stock and faith in
the performance of technical systems, such as the sensor systems in
early warning networks, and underestimate the fallibility of people and
machines?¶ It is of course not unreasonable to believe that the nuclear
responsibilities of any president are above the pay grade of every
living human being---that no one is really up to the task. The only real
protection against nuclear disaster is total elimination of nuclear
weapons.¶ And yet until that far-off day we expect our president at
least not to act rashly under pressure, and to ensure with near-absolute
certainty that the United States never launches a nuclear strike on the
basis of spurious indications of an incoming attack. It is possibly
asking too much, however, because even the most level-headed commander
in chief simply cannot process all that he or she needs to absorb under
the short deadlines imposed by warheads flying inbound at the speed of 4
miles per second. The risks of mistaken launch based on false warning,
human error in control systems, and panic in the face of imminent death
are very real and probably inherent in the hair-trigger nuclear postures
of the United States and Russia.¶ Most presidents during the Cold War
lived in dread of this moment knowing all too well the attendant risks.
Ronald Reagan expressed incredulity that he would be allowed only six
minutes to decide whether to trigger Armageddon based on blips on a
radar screen. There is no guarantee that the next president will
exercise due caution when the balloon appears to have gone up.¶ Although
no president during the atomic age appears to have ever lost his grip on
reality to such an extent that an insane nuclear act might have
resulted, top advisers to President Richard Nixon tried to constrain his
launch authority during the Watergate scandal that ultimately forced his
resignation. His secretary of Defense, James Schlesinger, quietly
instructed the Pentagon war room to double check with him if Nixon
contacted it to order up a nuclear strike. Nixon's mental stability, and
his heavy drinking, caused concern within his inner circle that he might
behave erratically out of despair and depression. Alcoholism in a future
nuclear monarch is of course quite beyond the pale.¶ Trump's teetotaling
lays that concern to rest, but his **[quick temper, defensiveness
bordering on paranoia and disdain for anyone who criticizes him do not
inspire deep confidence in his prudence. Can we trust a President Trump
to remain grounded and sensible under extraordinary pressure in a crisis
that appears to be crossing the nuclear Rubicon?]{.underline}**¶ Yet a
harried decision to launch on warning in the belief that the United
States is under nuclear attack is not even the most plausible scenario a
President Trump might face today. That is more likely to be a crisis
that escalates by design or inadvertence to the nuclear brink and then
spins out of control. To be sure, the U.S. and Russian launch on warning
postures have certainly put them at the mercy of false alarms. (Russia
adopted the practice during the Cold War and maintains it today despite
having a decrepit early warning network that has shortened President
Vladimir Putin's decision time to two to four minutes.) Computer
glitches and human error have generated serious false alarms in the
past, and every day events happen that trigger the sensors and require a
closer look---peaceful space launches (satellites and astronauts),
missile test launches, conventional combat missile launches, fighter
jets taking off on after-burners, and even wildfires. But close calls
have been fairly rare---about three serious false alarms in the United
States and three in the Soviet Union/Russia that could have led to a
very bad call by their leaders have occurred.¶ By comparison, **[there
have been dozens of intense confrontations between the nuclear
adversaries in the past, almost all of which tested the mettle,
composure and restraint of their leaders. The next president will become
embroiled in ongoing low-boil nuclear standoffs with Russia, China and
North Korea that could morph quickly into a full-blown nuclear
crisis]{.underline}**. In such situations, **[actions thought to be
defensive and reassuring to allies are often viewed as offensive by the
opponent, whose reaction starts another cycle of
action-reaction.]{.underline}**¶ The United States and Russia today are
entwining themselves in this trap over Ukraine, U.S. missile defenses in
Europe and other disputes. Military buildups with nuclear dimensions are
underway, and nuclear threats have been made explicitly by Russian
officials including Putin and implicitly by each side's nuclear force
operations---for instance, flying strategic bombers close to each side's
territory. Both Putin and President Barack Obama are reminding each
other, to a degree we haven't seen since the Cold War, that they have
nuclear buttons at hand.¶ \*\*\*¶ Trump would actually have not one but
several fingers on the nuclear button. One finger would be an active
digit ready to point up or down for an attack to his nuclear commanders.
Other fingers would shape the size and composition of U.S. nuclear
forces and the strategy for their use. Additional fingers would
determine nuclear actions taken in his absence or demise by presidential
successors from his vice president, the Cabinet that he appoints or by
generals to whom he may pre-delegate his launch authority.¶ As with his
predecessors, **[Trump's power over the life and death of entire nations
would be practically unbounded.]{.underline}** Today, the nuclear deluge
he could command would consist of thousands of weapons, each 10 or 20
times more deadly than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. **[Nearly 2,000
U.S. strategic nuclear weapons aimed primarily at Russia and China (at a
ratio of roughly 2 to 1), with additional dozens aimed at each of
several other nations---North Korea, Iran and Syria---would be at a
President Trump's disposal from his first minutes in
office.]{.underline}** The city of Moscow alone lies in the bore sights
of more than 100 U.S. nuclear warheads.¶ There are no restraints that
can prevent a willful president from unleashing this hell.¶ If he gave
the command, his executing commanders would have no legal or procedural
grounds to defy it no matter how inappropriate it might seem. As long as
the president can establish his or her true identity by his or her
personal presence in the Pentagon's nuclear war room or its alternates
(places like Site R at Fort Richie near Camp David), or by phone or
other means of communications linking him or her to these war rooms
using a special identification card (colloquially known as "the biscuit"
containing "the nuclear codes") in his or her possession (or,
alternatively, kept inside the "nuclear briefcase" carried by his or her
military aide who shadows the president everywhere he or she works,
travels and plays), a presidential nuclear decision is lawful (putting
international humanitarian law aside). It must be obeyed as long as it
is constitutional---i.e., the president as commander in chief believes
he or she is acting to protect and defend the nation against an actual
or imminent attack.¶ But within these broad constraints there is no
wiggle room for evasion or defiance of the president's orders. That's
true even if the national security adviser, the secretary of defense
(who along with the president makes up the "national command authority")
and other top appointees and advisers disagree with the president's
decision. It does not matter whether the United States has already come
under attack by nuclear or non-nuclear weapons. It does not even matter
if the commander in chief simply orders the use of nuclear weapons on an
ordinary day for reasons unknown to all but him or her. **[Under the
president's open-ended mandate to decide when the national interest is
threatened, ordering up a nuclear strike is his or her prerogative, and
obeying the order is incumbent upon the military servants of civilian
authority.]{.underline}**

Relations Committee, **[warned that the president was]{.underline}**
treating his office like "a reality show" and **[setting the country "on
the path to World War III]{.underline}**." In an interview with the New
York Times, he said of Trump, "I know for a fact that every single day
at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him." These
concerns, Corker told the Times, "were shared by nearly every Senate
Republican." **[It's not just Senate Republicans who worry over the
president's stability]{.underline}**. Carl **[Bernstein]{.underline}**,
of Watergate fame, told CNN that his reporting **[found "a consensus
developing in the military, at the highest levels in the intelligence
community]{.underline}**, among Republicans in Congress, including the
leaders in the business community," **[that Trump "is unfit to be the
president]{.underline}** of the United States." A subsequent poll by the
Military Times found only 30 percent of commissioned officers approved
of the job Trump was doing. The fear is shared by members of Trump's own
staff. Axios's Mike Allen reported that a collection of top White House
advisers see themselves as an informal "Committee to Save America," and
they measure their success "mostly in terms of bad decisions prevented,
rather than accomplishments chalked up." The Associated Press reported
that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and then-Homeland Security Secretary
John Kelly "agreed in the earliest weeks of Trump\'s presidency that one
of them should remain in the United States at all times to keep tabs on
the orders rapidly emerging from the White House." Their concerns echo
across the broader public. A September Quinnipiac poll found that 56
percent of voters believe Trump is unfit for office. Despite low
unemployment and steady economic growth, Trump's favorability is stuck
below 40 percent --- making him, at this point in his term, the most
unpopular president since the advent of polling. Of late, **[I have been
asking Republicans who work either in the White House or closely with it
whether Trump is learning on the job --- whether he is becoming more
judicious, more disciplined, more serious]{.underline}**. **[The answer,
unanimously, is that he is not]{.underline}**. **[He is the man he was
the day he stepped into the Oval Office, the same man he was on the
campaign trail, the same man so many of us feared he would be as
president]{.underline}**. In a November 2 interview on WMAL radio in
Washington, **[Trump lamented his inability to use his power to
prosecute his political enemies]{.underline}**. "You know the saddest
thing, because I'm the President of the United States, I am not supposed
to be involved with the Justice Department," he said. "I am not supposed
to be involved with the FBI. I'm not supposed to be doing the kinds of
things that I would love to be doing. And I'm very frustrated by it." It
is impossible to imagine the hellstorm that would have followed a
similar utterance by President Barack Obama or George W. Bush. **[That
Trump's daily provocations have left us inured and jaded to such
authoritarian yearnings is, itself, an injury he has inflicted upon
us.]{.underline}** Of late, **[Trump has taken to suggesting the Access
Hollywood tape]{.underline}** --- where he is clearly shown bragging
about sexual assault --- **[is a fraud]{.underline}**. These are
statements, notably, that Trump can not only be seen making, and heard
making, but statements he has admitted making. As is often the case,
**[it is unclear whether Trump is lying to us, or if he is somehow lying
to himself, as well. And it is hard to say which would be
scarier.]{.underline}** We talk often about running the US government
like a business, but businesses --- at least public ones --- have clear
methods for deposing a disastrous executive**[. The president of the
United States controls the world's largest nuclear arsenal, not to
mention the vast resources and powers of the federal government, and so
the possible damage of letting the wrong person inhabit the Oval Office
stretches all the way to]{.underline}** **[global
catastrophe]{.underline}**. But is there anything we can do about it?

### Diversionary War -- AT: Congress Checks

#### Congress can't check -- no consensus, executive power overwhelms -- Trump lashout risks World War 3

**Klein 17.** \[Ezra, Vox founder, political columnist, \"The case for
normalizing impeachment\" Vox \-- December 6 \--
https://www.vox.com/2017/11/30/16517022/impeachment-donald-trump\]

**[Even a Congress that intended to contain Trump would be limited in
its reach]{.underline}**. It **[is hard to overturn a presidential veto,
and the expansion of executive authority]{.underline}** we've seen in
recent decades **[has given the president plenty of power to wield even
faced with a hostile legislature]{.underline}**. "Having worked in the
modern executive branch, **[the notion that Congress has plenty of
weapons in the case of a very bad president is
overstated]{.underline}**," **[says Sunstein, who ran the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs under Obama]{.underline}**. "**[If
we]{.underline}** really **[had a terrible president determined to go in
directions that were economically terrible or terrible for national
security]{.underline}**, my view is **[Congress would have very limited
ability to stop it]{.underline}**; **[first]{.underline}** **[because of
the difficulty of]{.underline}** getting a **[consensus]{.underline}**,
**[but second because even if you got one]{.underline}**, **[there's
much the president can do on his own]{.underline}**." So here's where we
are now. **[The president is more powerful than the founders ever
envisioned]{.underline}**. **[We have a political system built around
parties, which gives the president protection from the massive
congressional majorities needed to activate impeachment]{.underline}**.
We have constructed an electoral system that neither follows the public
will nor includes safeguards against demagogues and knaves --- elites
have lost control of primaries and ceded power over the Electoral
College even as 40 percent of presidential elections since 2000 have
been won by the loser of the popular vote. And atop all that, **[our
political culture has evolved to see the removal of a president as a
historic, perhaps dangerous, affront.]{.underline}** Whatever this is,
it is not the system the founders foresaw. The result of all this is
that **[faced with an erratic]{.underline}** and even **[dangerous
president]{.underline}**, we try to criminalize or medicalize his
actions. Democrats want to see Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** removed
from office because they believe he **[is]{.underline}** unfit to hold
the job and **[a danger every day]{.underline}** he remains in it, but
few believe that is enough to merit impeachment. This is why Rep.
Sherman, who introduced articles of impeachment against Trump into
Congress, says, "the legal theoreticians will tell you that impeachment
just a matter of politics. I\'m a politician, and I\'m here to tell you
that it\'s a matter of legal analysis." This is why Lofgren calls for a
medical evaluation. Even if this is a correct judgment about politics,
it is profoundly reckless. **[We have made the presidency too
powerful]{.underline}** to leave the holder of the office
**[functionally unaccountable]{.underline}** for four years. We have
created a political culture in which firing our national executive is
viewed as a crisis rather than as a difficult but occasionally necessary
act. And we have done this even though we recognize that **[the
consequences of]{.underline}** leaving **[the wrong president in power
can include horrors beyond imagination --- World War III,]{.underline}**
as Sen. Corker suggested.

#### Congress not key to foreign policy - presidential latitude and partisan politics ensure concentration of executive war powers

**Economist 15**

4-21-15 The Economist "Congress\'s influence over foreign policy"
https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/04/economist-explains-19

THE Senate Foreign Relations Committee has voted to give the United
States Congress the final word on any nuclear deal struck with Iran; the
Senate's Finance Committee has decided that Congress should get an up-
or down-vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal between
America and dozen Pacific nations. Most foreigners, and quite a few
Americans, assume that the president runs the nation's foreign policy.
This is not the case. But neither is Congress wholly in charge. The
legislative body's preferred outcome is sometimes to demand a say while
declining to endorse the kind of compromises that foreign policy often
requires. **[What influence does the legislature actually have over
America\'s foreign affairs? Under the constitution Congress declares
war, ratifies treaties and has the power of the purse. That ought to
make the body sovereign in foreign affairs. In practice, presidents have
plenty of power when they are responding to a fast-moving
event.]{.underline}** **[One recent example is the bombing campaign
against Islamic State, which has been conducted by the White House under
an authorisation for the use of force passed just after the attacks of
September 11th, 2001]{.underline}**. Members of Congress have complained
about this, and the White House has explored the possibility of securing
a more up-to-date resolution. Yet **[Congress would rather not take a
stand on the matter. Republicans are generally concerned that the
wording of such a resolution would be too weak, while Democrats think it
risks being too open-ended, thus leaving the campaign to the
president.]{.underline}** The Iranian nuclear deal is a different case.
It is slow moving, making it harder for the president\'s administration
to claim that it is merely responding to events in a timely way. And it
will result in a treaty. Yet **[the precedent here is confusing: most of
America's international agreements have become law after the White House
issued an executive order rather than after ratification by
Congress.]{.underline}** Big, controversial treaties do tend to come
before Congress, however. The legislative branch refused to ratify the
Treaty of Versailles at the end of the first world war and, more
recently, the comprehensive ban on nuclear testing, which was signed by
George H.W. Bush in 1992 but which does not yet carry the force of law.

### Diversionary War -- Studies

#### Strong empirical support -- only our studies account for [interactions]{.underline} of domestic unrest and appropriate target choice -- causes great power transition wars

**Jung, 13 \-\--** Sung Chul Jung, Myongji University, Seoul, Foreign
Policy, International Relations, PhD, International Studies Quarterly,

**[Conclusion and Implications In sum, domestically troubled states have
two faces: They are aggressive against some, but not against others.
When faced with domestic unrest, political leaders]{.underline}** should
**[succeed in selling their military aggression to domestic audience by
choosing appropriate targets.]{.underline}** In other words,
**[political leaders are motivated by domestic conditions, but also
constrained by foreign conditions. This is why this study focusing on
the interaction between domestic unrest and foreign conditions finds
stronger empirical support than previous large-N studies on diversionary
conflict]{.underline}**. In fact, as noted from the emergence of
neoclassical realism and its popularity at least since the 1990s,19
**[many IR scholars]{.underline}** have begun to **[call for renewed
attention to the interaction of factors across levels]{.underline}**
(Elman 1997:viiii; Levy and Thompson 2010:212). **[This study shows how
this approach leads to a logically more complete explanation of onsets
of power transition and territorial conflicts]{.underline}**. On the one
hand, students of international security have asked when a declining
power adopts a preventive action against a rising power and when a state
initiates a military action in order to stop an unfavorable change in
balance of power. **[By testing the rising power target hypothesis, I
found that domestic unrest significantly influences a relatively
declining power\'s initiation of military conflict. Only when suffering
from domestic unrest is a declining power more likely to start a
military conflict against a rising power target than against a
non-attractive target.]{.underline}** When a state sees a relative
decline but has no internal troubles, its targeting of a rising power is
as likely as is the targeting of a non-attractive state. This tendency
is strongest when a potential target is "slightly stronger" than a
potential initiator. In addition, this study shows that declining
hegemonic powers are preferred as military targets by domestically
troubled states. From the result of testing the hegemony target
hypothesis, I find that domestically troubled states are more likely to
initiate interstate conflict with declining hegemons than with
non-attractive targets. This implies that a regional or local hegemon\'s
decline often invites military aggression by other states. Second, this
study also provides an answer to an old question in security studies,
namely "When and why do territorial conflicts (re)occur?" **[By testing
the territorial target hypothesis, this study shows that a
challenger]{.underline}** in a territorial claim **[is more likely to
initiate a military conflict]{.underline}** against its territorial
claim opponent **[when it suffers from domestic troubles than when it is
experiencing no internal trouble]{.underline}**. What is interesting is
that this tendency is most apparent when a potential target is "weaker"
than a potential initiator. By targeting a weaker territorial target
rather than a stronger one, political leaders may sell their military
action as risk-free and beneficial to their domestic audience and then
demand public support for their leadership. **[In sum, this result
implies that political leaders are often incentivized to favor
diversionary behavior]{.underline}** when their states are seeking to
(re)occupy disputed territory.

#### [Only]{.underline} our studies accounts for [combo]{.underline} of internal factors AND external targets -- its [quantitatively significant]{.underline} -- indicts don't apply

States fight wars. Why? **[Domestic unrest has been regarded as one of
the causes of interstate war]{.underline}**.1 Many journalists as well
as **[scholars]{.underline}** often **[shed light on domestic
troubles]{.underline}** in their attempts **[to explain why political
leaders choose military aggression.]{.underline}** According to their
view**[, leaders with domestic vulnerability]{.underline}** tend to
**[initiate interstate conflicts]{.underline}** in order **[to divert
public attention to foreign affairs and to call for domestic support for
their leadership]{.underline}**. This **[diversionary war theory has
gained support from inductive (case studies) and deductive studies
(formal modeling]{.underline}**). On the one hand, some international
relations (**[IR) scholars have shown]{.underline}**, by analyzing
individual historical cases such as the Falklands/Malvinas War and World
War I, that **[political leaders\' decisions for using military force
against other states are driven by personal rather than national
interests]{.underline}**.2 **[When faced with domestic challenges to
their political leadership, struggling leaders have initiated
international conflict, demanded domestic strong support for "national"
survival and interests, and stigmatized their political opponents as
anti-patriotic]{.underline}**. On the other, some **[scholars have
developed an agent-principal analytic framework in which an unpopular
leader is expected to initiate a foreign conflict in order to
demonstrate his/her competence to a domestic audience]{.underline}** and
increase the probability of staying in power. (Richards, Morgan, Wilson,
Schwebach, and Young 1993; Tarar 2006).3 **[Diversionary action is a
rational decision made by domestically vulnerable leaders whose primary
concern is for personal political survival. However, this diversionary
war theory has faced a challenge from statistical analyses for a large
number of cases]{.underline}** (Rummel 1963; Tanter 1966; Ostrom and Job
1986; Meernik 2004).4 Although IR scholars could prove and show how
diversionary incentives contributed to the onset of interstate conflicts
in formal modeling and descriptive case studies, **[the quantitative
evidence]{.underline}** for the correlation between domestic unrest and
interstate conflict **[was not strong enough to support the diversionary
war theory]{.underline}**. **[This gap]{.underline}** **[between theory
and evidence, and between anecdotal studies and large-N studies, has led
some scholars to seek some condition]{.underline}**---such as regime
type---**[under which domestic unrest causes interstate
conflict]{.underline}**. One good example is the absence of democratic
diversion. Some have argued that **[democracies are more likely than
nondemocracies to initiate diversionary conflict, because democratic
leaders cannot rely on the repression authoritarian leaders often use
and because they are more vulnerable to overt domestic
dissatisfaction]{.underline}** (Gelpi 1997; Kisangani and Pickering
2009). By contrast, others insist that democratic leaders are not able
to initiate a diversionary conflict even if they are willing to do so.
Democratic leaders, they say, cannot hide their hostile intention due to
transparency of decision making; furthermore, their potential targets
may make strategic moves in order to avoid being a target in
international conflict (Smith 1996; Leeds and Davis 1997; Clark 2003).
**[This study focuses on types of potential targets in order to explore
whether and when domestic unrest leads to interstate conflict. The
driving question here is: "What kinds of states attract diversionary
actions by domestically troubled states? Given that struggling leaders
seek a foreign state with which a conflict can produce domestic
support,]{.underline}** and not a domestic backfire, **[it is worthwhile
to take into consideration the combination of internal
conditions]{.underline}** (for example, **[domestic unrest) and external
conditions]{.underline}** (for example, **[potential target) in order to
have a better understanding of foreign aggression]{.underline}**. Why
did General Leopoldo Galtieri, for example, choose to occupy the
Falkland Islands, but not initiate a non-territorial conflict or a
conflict with other states?5 Based on the assumption that **[political
leaders\' decisions for diversionary action include prudent choices of
targets]{.underline}**, this study examines whether and how **[domestic
unrest and some types of foreign target result in interstate conflict.
Only limited attention has been paid to diversionary
targets]{.underline}**.6 Some scholars have pointed to dyadic condition
(that is, rivalry and "contentious issues") in order to explore whether
dyad types affect diversionary military action (Mitchell and Prins 2004;
Mitchell and Thyne 2010). **[All territorial and hegemonic
rivals]{.underline}**, however, **[are not equal in producing domestic
support. By differentiating territorial rivals]{.underline}** in terms
of challengers and defenders, and hegemonic competitors in terms of
declining and non-declining, **[this study expects and shows that some
rivals are more popular diversionary targets than others.]{.underline}**
This article proceeds as follows. First, **[I propose a diversionary
target theory that expects domestically vulnerable leaders to prefer
fear-producing targets (states with rising power and different
identities]{.underline}**), **[greed-producing targets (states occupying
disputed territory and possessing regional or local hegemon), and
similar power targets]{.underline}**. Second, I explain my
**[quantitative research]{.underline}** design, discussing case
selection and measurement. Third, I show how my **[analysis results in
support for my hypotheses on the rising power, territory, and hegemony
target]{.underline}** and refutes my hypothesis for the identity target.
Lastly, I discuss the contribution that this study makes to
understanding of territorial conflicts and power transition conflicts.

### Diversionary War -- Trump

#### Specifically true for Trump - risk of miscalc is high

**Torpey 17.** \[John, Presidential Professor of Sociology and History
and Director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at
the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, "Defining
Trumpism: Making sense of the first 100 days" The Hill \-- April 26 \--

The shock and awe with which the Trump administration initially took
office has given way to an apparent lull, a period of seeming
disorientation and grasping for direction. There are reports of a palace
coup against Stephen Bannon and of an assertion of control by steadier
hands. But make no mistake: **[this is a dangerous moment with a White
House occupied by a president whose only qualification for election was
a charismatic connection with a strategically located base swayed by
nostalgic images of a once-and-future "great" America]{.underline}**. It
is dangerous because the president's only real political capital is his
charisma, and charismatic leaders must deliver heroic feats. With the
morass on the domestic side, **[Trump has turned his limited attention
span to international affairs, where the risks of miscalculation and
violent death are much greater.]{.underline}**

#### Insecurity drives Trump -- Risks escalation of multiple hotspots

**Bouie 17**(Jamelle, staff @ Slate, "Trump's Defining Trait",
<http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/04/>
how_trump_could_save_his_flailing_presidency_with_smart_tax_reform.html)

Donald **[Trump has]{.underline}** just **[three months in
office]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** even now, **[we can see
what he brings to the White House]{.underline}**. Not the strength or
mastery he works to project with every public appearance, but its
opposite: **[insecurity]{.underline}**. As president, **[Trump is
profoundly insecure]{.underline}**: insecure about his electoral
victory, insecure **[about his public standing]{.underline}**, and
insecure about his progress as chief executive. President Trump's
smothering insecurity is evident in his recent interview with the
Associated Press. Throughout the long and meandering exchange, Trump
repeatedly turns from questions of policy and program to the obsessions
and insecurities that seem to consume his attention. When asked, for
example, if he'll reject a bill to fund the government if it doesn't
include funding for a border wall, Trump pivots from the issue at hand
to a discussion of the Electoral College. "You know, it's funny. The
Democrats, they have a big advantage in the Electoral College," said
Trump, later adding that "the Electoral College is very difficult for a
Republican to win." This focus on the Electoral College---and how
difficult it's supposed to be for Republican presidential
candidates---is a regular tic for Trump. "You know, look, the Democrats
had a tremendous opportunity because the Electoral College, as I said,
is so skewed to them," said Trump in response to questions about his
White House team. "The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a
Democrat that it's very, very hard." It's difficult to discern the exact
reason for these digressions. But the best explanation is that Trump
remains self-conscious about his failure to win the national popular
vote or is possibly already worried that he might lose re-election.
Harping on difficulty of an Electoral College victory is a way of saying
that he accomplished the hard part of an election and of creating an
excuse for any potential future failure. **[Which is tied to another
aspect of Trump's insecurity: his childlike need for constant
affirmation]{.underline}**. "I have learned one thing, because I get
treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media," said
Trump, in a long non sequitur that came after the AP asked about his
work building relationships with Democrats. "I get treated so badly," he
said, at one point characterizing CNN, MSNBC, and CBS as nemeses and
suggesting they were "fake media." Indeed, this happens throughout.
President Trump does not get very far without referring to what he feels
is unfair treatment from the press, regularly saying that the media
isn't covering any of his accomplishments or giving him sufficient
praise for his dealmaking. "Nobody wrote that story," he said in
reference to what he describes as major cost savings for military
aircraft but what---in reality---is more modest and less tied to Trump's
negotiating skills. **[With any]{.underline}** given
**[issue]{.underline}** and on any given concern, **[Trump turns
immediately to how he's perceived]{.underline}**. Similarly, with the
100-days marker, Trump dismisses it as an "artificial barrier" and says
voters shouldn't judge him on it, while simultaneously arguing that he
has accomplished most of the items on his list for the period. It's as
if Trump knows he is far behind on his agenda---that, a Supreme Court
justice aside, he has done relatively little as president---but that he
also has to affirm his self-image as a historic, consequential leader.
It's why, when the topic turned to his February address to Congress,
Trump turned immediately to extreme hyperbole. "\[S\]ome people said it
was the single best speech ever made in that chamber," he said. Later,
he repeated his false---or at least distorted---story about Democratic
Rep. Elijah Cummings. "He said, 'You will be,' in front of five, six
people, he said, 'You will be the greatest president in the history of
this country,' " Trump claimed. When the AP disputed that
characterization, he repeated himself. (The difficulty for Trump here
seems to be an unacknowledged and very big if in Cummings' remarks.)
With any given issue and on any given concern, Trump turns immediately
to how he's perceived; whether the press is unfair, whether he is
getting his due. And while he denounces outlets like MSNBC and CNN,
**[he is]{.underline}** clearly **[preoccupied with]{.underline}** the
**[cable news and hyperattentive to what's said about
him]{.underline}**. "By the way, I'm 10--0 for that. I've called every
one of them," said Trump about his early statement describing the recent
attack in France as "terrorism" before all the details were known. Once
again, here, he's complaining about press criticism, eventually ending
his digression by affirming his position as president. "Whatever. In the
meantime, I'm here, and they're not." Donald Trump is fond of statements
like that, fond of reminding his interlocutors that he resides in the
White House. One imagines he sees it as a statement of confidence. In
reality, it's the boast of someone who protests a bit too much, who
feels less secure in his station than he might project. One last point:
**[Presidential insecurity isn't harmless]{.underline}**, especially
**[for a commander in chief who is obsessed with winning and who seems
to see life as a dominance game]{.underline}**, where someone or
something has to be a loser. **[What happens when the insecure president
can't move his agenda]{.underline}** through Congress? What happens when
his plans fail? What does he do to ensure that, above all, he isn't a
loser? **[If]{.underline}** our **[recent]{.underline}** national
**[adventures with Afghanistan, Syria, and North Korea are any
indication, we have a]{.underline}** good, and **[worrying, answer for
that question]{.underline}**.

#### That lashout will be violent

**Chelala17** (Dr. Cesar, international public health consultant and the
winner of several journalism awards, "Shrinks take a stab at what makes
Trump tick",
http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/02/14/commentary/world-commentary/shrinks-take-stab-makes-trump-tick/#.WKPPcjsrJhE)

In that regard, one could say that **[Trump's psychological
characteristics are consistent with a person with]{.underline}**
Antisocial Personality Disorder **[(ASPD]{.underline}**), **[which is
characterized by a pattern of disregard for]{.underline}**, or violation
of, **[the rights of others]{.underline}**. **[Also
apparent]{.underline}** in this disorder **[is a history
of]{.underline}** legal problems and of impulsive and **[aggressive
behavior]{.underline}**. **[Individuals with this disorder generally
have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own
gain and pleasure]{.underline}**. They frequently manipulate and deceive
other people through a facade of wit and superficial charm, or even
through intimidation and violence. What makes this disorder particularly
dangerous is that among its other characteristics those who have it are
often reckless and impulsive, and fail to consider the consequences of
their actions. In addition, **[they are often aggressive and manifest a
lopsided temper, lashing out with violence to what they perceive is a
provocation]{.underline}**. Robert Caro, President Lyndon Johnson's
great biographer, said, "Although the cliche says that power always
corrupts, what is seldom said ... is that power always reveals." Anyone
who has observed Trump's actions since assuming the presidency cannot
fail but notice his increasingly impulsive decisions, his notable
frustration at not receiving the response that he expected and a failure
to admit that he has been wrong or apologizing when harming others. What
we have is a situation where the most powerful person in the world is
tainted by personality **[characteristics that could pose serious harm
to global peace. The extent to which these harmful characteristics can
be controlled may well decide the future of the world.]{.underline}**

### China War

#### Trump would go after China

Isaac Stone **Fish 2017** (senior fellow at the Asia Society's Center on
US-China Relations, "If the US ever went to war with China, it would be
a Trump distraction technique," The Guardian, 1-25
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/25/donald-trump-south-china-sea-distraction-technique)

First, the good news. Donald **[Trump almost certainly does not wish to
go to war with China]{.underline}** over the disputed islands in the
South China Sea. Yes, in his Senate confirmation hearing in mid-January,
secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson provocatively compared
Beijing's moves in the sea to "Russia's taking of Crimea" and said its
"access to these islands also is not going to be allowed". And on
Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer pledged to defend
"international territories" in the South China Sea. But the simplest --
and, frankly, more believable -- explanation is that both men misspoke.
In the same hearing, Tillerson mistakenly said \$5tn in trade passes
through the South China Sea daily -- it's yearly. Trump's team is new,
relatively inexperienced in foreign policy and less reliant on expert
briefings. As Dennis Wilder, the top White House Asia adviser to George
W Bush, put it: "Tillerson and the new press secretary are just not yet
steeped in the arcane nature and legal niceties of the South China Sea
issue." Moreover, blockading the islands is not only "literally an act
of war", but "operationally almost impossible" an American South China
Sea expert, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of
the situation, told me. And that, he said, indicates "it is a temper
tantrum" -- one that Trump may be using with the intention of trying to
exert trade concessions from China -- and "not a believable threat".
That is the good news. The bad news is that **[if in the coming months
or years Trump faces an ignominious end to his presidency through
scandal or mismanagement, a national crisis -- involving China, or Isis
or another foreign actor -- could allow him to cling to
power]{.underline}**. **[After national crises involving foreign actors,
presidents often enjoy a bump in popularity]{.underline}**. John F
**[Kennedy, for example, saw his popularity shoot up after the Cuban
missile crisis, while after]{.underline}** the **[9/11]{.underline}**
attacks in 2001, George W **[Bush's approval rating
jumped]{.underline}** from the mid-50s **[to a record
high]{.underline}** of 92%. In December 1979, the Republican
presidential candidate John Connally reversed his earlier criticism of
Jimmy Carter's handling of the ongoing Iranian hostage crisis. "We have
only one president," Connally said. "Now is the time to rally behind him
and show a solid front to Iran and the world." **[Political scientists
call this the "rally round the flag effect", and there are two schools
of thought for why it happens, according to the scholars]{.underline}**
Marc J **[Hetherington and]{.underline}** Michael
**[Nelson]{.underline}**. There's the "patriotism" school, where **[the
president embodies the spirit of the nation, earning himself a place
above criticism]{.underline}**, and the "opinion leadership" school,
where "leaders' unwillingness to criticize leaves journalists with
nothing to report -- and citizens with nothing to read, see or hear --
that is not supportive of the president". **[Trump surely understands
this, and may be tempted to aggravate a national crisis in order to
protect himself. He is a keen student, not of history]{.underline}** --
he said recently that his two favorite books were ones that he himself
wrote -- but **[of human psychology, and especially of mass
appeal]{.underline}**. **[If Trump exacerbating a tense situation into a
national crisis, or even a war, in order to save his presidency sounds
far-fetched, consider his palpable insecurity, and how he obsesses over
signs of his popularity.]{.underline}** Trump's White House continues to
insist that his inauguration crowd was the largest ever, and that he
only lost the popular vote because of massive election fraud -- both
obvious lies. For Trump, public acclaim seems to justify his existence.
Also, Trump enters office beleaguered. His approval rating is the lowest
for a new president since Gallup begun surveying the issue in the Dwight
D Eisenhower era. And his myriad financial interests, his refusal to
release his tax returns, his impulsiveness, his penchant for nepotism,
and his willingness to mix business and pleasure greatly increase the
chance for an impeachable scandal. Moreover, **[Trump has shown himself
masterful at hijacking the national conversation to redirect attention
away from his scandals and incompetence]{.underline}**: "the Distractor
in Chief", in the words of the Washington Post's Paul Farhi. **[A state
of national emergency following an Isis attack, or a war with China to,
say, "steal our jobs back" would follow that same pattern -- only
amplified. We underestimate his desire to maintain that popularity, and
the tactics he would employ to do so, at our own peril.]{.underline}**
Yes, the rally round the flag effect is temporary -- lasting only a few
weeks to several years, depending on the nature of the crisis. And
presidential popularity can suffer when a war imposes financial and
societal costs. But its effect is real. If Trump is voted out of office,
or impeached and convicted, it does not matter what threat the US is
facing. It does not matter if we find ourselves enmeshed in a war with
China, or scrambling to respond to an unprecedentedly devastating
terrorist attack. He must go. **["In times of national
crises,"]{.underline}** Hetherington and Nelson wrote, **["Americans
rally to the president as the anthropomorphic symbol of national unity
-- a kind of living flag." In some ways, our national nightmare would be
a Trump dream: a period where his acclaim is absolute and
unimpeachable.]{.underline}**

#### Trump's diversionary war will attack China 

Ben **Reynolds 2017** (Writer and Foreign Policy Analyst in New York,
"Tillerson, Trump, and U.S. China Policy," China US Policy, Feb 7^th^
https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/tillerson-trump-and-us-china-policy)

Nevertheless, **[Tillerson will not be the primary figure responsible
for U.S. policy towards China]{.underline}**. **[The general trend in
recent years has been the increasing centralization of decision-making
in the executive branch.]{.underline}** The Obama administration was
renowned for allowing most cabinet secretaries little room to operate on
their own. The Trump administration may very well continue this trend.
Tillerson was reportedly not even informed about the extremely
controversial immigration ban, although handling its inevitable fallout
certainly fell under the purview of the State Department. It is hard to
foresee how the internal dynamics and palace politics of the Trump White
House will influence China policy at this stage. **[It is more important
to consider the administration's interests]{.underline}** and general
U.S. interests **[if we want to predict how the U.S. will manage its
relationship with China]{.underline}** over the next four years.
Unfortunately, **[it seems that the administration will have incentives
to provoke a foreign crisis to distract from its domestic failures
unless it miraculously improves its approval ratings]{.underline}**.
(Absent a major terrorist attack, it will not.) **[China]{.underline}**
and Iran **[are]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** two **[obvious
targets of such a diversionary strategy. This means that, regardless of
the U.S.'s long-term strategic interests, domestic politics may cause
the administration to behave aggressively towards China.]{.underline}**
One could argue that there are important ways in which U.S. interests
might diverge from the interests of the Trump administration. If one
believes that the U.S. is interested in preventing the hindrance of
trade and ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, then Trump's
incentives to deal belligerently with China would contradict those
interests. The administration's lack of polish and refusal to abide by
basic diplomatic protocol will likely undermine U.S. ideological
hegemony in the region. These facts are no doubt deeply troubling to
liberal foreign policy professionals at the Brookings Institution. That
said**[, the atmosphere in Washington has been gradually tilting in
favor of confrontation with China for years now]{.underline}**. **[A
declining power like the United States has every incentive to confront
its rising challenger sooner rather than later, assuming it is unwilling
to allow a transfer of power.]{.underline}** **[China's military
capabilities and international influence grow with each passing
year.]{.underline}** U**[.S. military planners understand this fact
well, and there are few (if any) members of the U.S. foreign policy
elite who are willing to give up U.S. hegemony in Asia without a fight.
Trump's belligerence towards China is not a radical
departure]{.underline}** from the preceding administration; **[it is a
change in tone, not a change in underlying attitude.]{.underline}** The
Obama administration did not take such an aggressive position on Taiwan,
but it was Obama's White House that reignited security competition with
China after the relatively placid Bush years. We would do well to
remember that Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, was one of the
preeminent architects of "assertive" U.S. policy in the Asia-Pacific.
The ascension of a right-wing buffoon to the presidency did not seem to
radically alter the established trend of deteriorating U.S.-China
relations. However, **[two important things have changed]{.underline}**.
**[The first of these factors is perceived legitimacy]{.underline}**.
Donald **[Trump's aggressive, toddler-like demeanor has the potential to
aggravate and alienate U.S. allies.]{.underline}** There are massive
material incentives for many allies to continue cooperating with the
United States, but the perception of being bullied and humiliated by
Trump will generate domestic pressure to push back against certain U.S.
interests. Trump's recent childish behavior on a diplomatic call with
Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's Prime Minister, seems to have ruffled
feathers. Outside the region, European Council President Donald Tusk
made headlines by describing Trump's America as a threat to Europe.
These reflect a potential shift in the diplomatic atmosphere that may
make it harder for certain leaders to publicly support U.S. policy.
**[The second factor is the likelihood of a thaw in U.S.-Russian
relations]{.underline}**. Rex Tillerson, reportedly has a good personal
relationship with Vladimir Putin, and he may have an important role in
managing U.S.-Russian relations. **[The U.S. has already eased some
sanctions on Russia]{.underline}**. **[Trump has made no secret of his
admiration for Putin and willingness to work with Russi]{.underline}**a
in Syria. There will be significant internal pushback on these issues,
including from powerful agencies like the CIA. Nevertheless, **[a
U.S.-Russia thaw poses serious risks for China]{.underline}**.
Simultaneous U.S. belligerence toward Russia and China under the Obama
administration pushed both countries closer together, but a U.S.-Russian
détente could undermine those ties. Tripolarity is notoriously unstable,
and there are obvious incentives for two powers to ally themselves
against the third. **[The Trump presidency thus presents]{.underline}**
both **[risks and opportunities for China. The risks may be quite
severe.]{.underline}** **[Trump's administration may attempt to provoke
a diversionary crisis that could do irreparable harm to both the United
States and China.]{.underline}** Ten years from now, a military
confrontation **[could end U.S. hegemony in Asia.]{.underline}** Now,
however, **[China would be drawn into a draining, protracted conflict
with little hope of real victory for either side]{.underline}**. On the
other hand, there are real opportunities for China as well. The Chinese
government has the opportunity to play the "adult in the room,"
presenting itself as the only stable guardian of regional security.
Trump's demeanor, domestic instability in the U.S., and unnecessary U.S.
escalation will all play into this perception. If China can avoid a
direct clash with the United States, it may find that the reassessment
of its

#### Trump lash out causes conflict in the SCS causing Nuclear war\-\--Impact Defense doesn't apply to Trump

**Klare 17 --** Michael Klare, Professor of Peace and World Security
Studies at Hampshire College, "Escalation Watch: Four Global Hotspots
for Trump", Asia Times, 1-20,
http://www.atimes.com/article/escalation-watch-four-global-hotspots-trump/

Within months of taking office, President Donald Trump is likely to face
one or more **[major international crises]{.underline}**, possibly
**[entail]{.underline}**ing **[a risk of nuclear
escalation.]{.underline}** Not since the end of the Cold War has a new
chief executive been confronted with as many **[potential flashpoints
involv]{.underline}**ing such **[a potential for explosive
conflict]{.underline}**. This proliferation of crises has been brewing
for some time, but **[the situation appears especially ominous now given
Trump's pledge to bring American military force swiftly to bear on any
threats of foreign transgression]{.underline}**. With so much at risk,
it's none too soon to go on a permanent escalation watch, monitoring the
major global hotspots for any sign of imminent flare-ups, hoping that
early warnings (and the outcry that goes with them) might help avert
catastrophe. Looking at the world today, four **[areas appear to pose an
especially high risk of sudden crisis and conflict]{.underline}**: North
Korea, **[the South China Sea]{.underline}**, the Baltic Sea region, and
the Middle East. Each of them has been the past site of recurring
clashes, and all are primed to explode early in the Trump presidency.
Why are we seeing so many potential crises now? Is this period really
different from earlier presidential transitions? It's true that the
changeover from one presidential administration to another can be a time
of global uncertainty, given America's pivotal importance in world
affairs and the natural inclination of rival powers to test the mettle
of the country's new leader. There are, however, other factors that make
this moment particularly worrisome, including the changing nature of the
world order, the personalities of its key leaders, and an ominous shift
in military doctrine. Trump may lift gold as new leaders carry risk Just
as the United States is going through a major political transition, so
is the planet at large. **[The sole-superpower system of the post-Cold
War era is finally giving way to a multipolar, if not increasingly
fragmented, world in which the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[must share the limelight with]{.underline}**
other major actors, including **[China]{.underline}**, Russia, India,
and Iran. Political scientists remind us that **[transitional periods
can often prove disruptive, as "status quo" powers]{.underline}** (in
this case, the United States) **[resist challenges to their dominance
from "revisionist" states seeking to alter the global power equation.
Typically, this can entail proxy wars and other kinds of sparring over
contested areas, as]{.underline}** has recently been the case
**[in]{.underline}** Syria, the Baltic, and **[the South China
Sea]{.underline}**. This is where the personalities of key leaders enter
the equation. **[Though]{.underline}** President **[Obama oversaw
constant warfare, he was temperamentally disinclined to respond with
force]{.underline}** to every overseas crisis and provocation, fearing
involvement in yet more foreign wars like Iraq and Afghanistan. His
critics, including Donald Trump, complained bitterly that this stance
only encouraged foreign adversaries to up their game, convinced that the
US had lost its will to resist provocation. In a Trump administration,
as The Donald indicated on the campaign trail last year, America's
adversaries should expect far tougher responses. Asked in September, for
instance, about an incident in the Persian Gulf in which Iranian
gunboats approached American warships in a threatening manner, he
typically told reporters, "When they circle our beautiful destroyers
with their little boats and make gestures that ... they shouldn't be
allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water." Although with
Russia, unlike Iran, Trump has promised to improve relations, there's no
escaping the fact that Vladimir Putin's urge to restore some of his
country's long-lost superpower glory could lead to confrontations with
Nato powers that would put the new American president in a distinctly
awkward position. Regarding Asia, **[Trump has often spoken of his
intent to punish China]{.underline}** for what he considers its
predatory trade practices, a stance guaranteed to clash with President
Xi Jinping's goal of restoring his country's greatness. **[This
should]{.underline}**, in turn, **[generate additional possibilities for
confrontation, especially in the contested South China
Sea.]{.underline}** Both Putin and Xi, moreover, are facing economic
difficulties at home and view foreign adventurism as a way of
distracting public attention from disappointing domestic performances.

### China War -- Time Frame

#### Escalates quickly

**Brown 1/20** (James, UNITED STATES STUDIES CENTRE, Australia,

JAMES BROWN: Well, how do **[wars start]{.underline}**? Generally there

shows **[this scenario is not only possible but one that could quickly
escalate]{.underline}**. JAMES BROWN: US military assets and Chinese
military assets operate in close proximity all the time, every day. Any
time a US ship goes into the South China Sea, there is a Chinese ship
shadowing it. In the air, Chinese and US planes have passed within tens
of metres with each other. Now there are protocols to govern those
interactions but **[there are pilots and ship captains who are known to
be rogue operators]{.underline}**. **[The US and China talk about this
and there are always accidents that happen and miscalculations so it
could escalate very quickly]{.underline}**.

### China War -- AT: Impact Defense

#### Causes nuclear war with China -- Checks don't apply 

**Menon 17.** \[Rajan, staff @ Toms Dispatch via AlterNet, "Is President
Trump Headed for a War With China?",
http://www.alternet.org/world/president-trump-headed-war-china\]

**[Facing off against China]{.underline}**, President **[Trump could
find himself in a similar predicament, having so emphasized his
toughness, his determination to regain America's lost respect and make
the country great again]{.underline}**. The bigger problem, however,
will undoubtedly be his own narcissism and his obsession with winning,
**[not to mention his inability to resist sending incendiary
messages]{.underline}** via Twitter. Just try to imagine for a moment
how a president who blows his stack during a getting-to-know-you phone
call with the prime minister of Australia, a close ally, is likely to
conduct himself in a confrontation with a country he's labeled a prime
adversary. In the event of a military crisis between China and the
United States, neither side may want an escalation, to say nothing of a
nuclear war. Yet **[Trump's threats to impose]{.underline}** 45%
**[tariffs on]{.underline}** Chinese **[exports to the U.S. and
his]{.underline}** repeated **[condemnation of China as a "currency
manipulator" and stealer of American jobs have already produced a
poisonous atmosphere between the]{.underline}** world's
**[two]{.underline}** most powerful **[countries]{.underline}**. And
**[it was made worse by his]{.underline}** December phone
**[conversation with Taiwan]{.underline}**'s president, Tsai Ing-wen,
which created doubts about his commitment to the One China policy the
United States has adhered to since 1972. The Chinese authorities
apparently made it clear to the White House that there couldn\'t even be
a first-time phone call to Xi unless the new president agreed to stick
with that policy. During a conversation with the Chinese president on
February 9th, Trump reportedly provided that essential assurance. Given
the new American president's volatility, however, **[Beijing will be
playing close attention to his words and actions, even his symbolic
ones]{.underline}**, related to Taiwan. Sooner or later, **[if Trump
doesn't also dial down the rest of his rhetoric on China, its leaders
will surely ratchet up theirs, thereby aggravating the situation
further]{.underline}**. So far, they've restrained themselves in order
to figure Trump out---not an easy task even for Americans---and in hopes
that his present way of dealing with the world might be replaced with
something more conventional and recognizable. Hope, as they say, springs
eternal, but as of now, in repeatedly insisting that China must do as he
says, Trump and his surrogates have inserted themselves and the country
into a complicated territorial dispute far from America's shores. The
hubris of Washington acting as the keeper of world order, but regularly
breaking the rules as it wishes, whether by invading Iraq in 2003 or
making open use of torture and a global network of secret prisons, is an
aspect of American behavior long obvious to foreign powers. It looks to
be the essence of Trumpism, too, even if its roots are old indeed.
**[Don't dismiss the importance of heated exchanges between Washington
and Beijing in the wake of Trump's election.]{.underline}** The
political atmosphere between rival powers, especially those with massive
arsenals, can matter a great deal when they face off in a crisis.
**[Pernicious stereotypes and mutual mistrust only
increase]{.underline}** the **[odds]{.underline}** that crucial
**[info]{.underline}**rmation **[will be misinterpreted]{.underline}**
in the heat of the moment because of entrenched beliefs that are immune
to contrary evidence, misperceptions, worst-case calculations, and
up-the-ante reactions. In academic jargon, these constitute **[the
ingredients for a classic conflict spiral]{.underline}**. In such a
situation, events take control of leaders, producing outcomes that none
of them sought. Not for nothing during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
did President John Kennedy look to Barbara Tuchman's book, Guns of
August---a gripping account of how Europe slipped and slid into a
disastrous world war in 1914. There has been lots of anxiety about the
malign effects that Donald Trump's temperament and beliefs could have
domestically, and for good reason. But **[in domestic politics,
institutions and laws, civic organizations, the press, and public
protests can serve]{.underline}**, however imperfectly, **[as
countervailing forces. In international politics, crises can erupt
suddenly and unfold rapidly---and]{.underline}** the **[checks on rash
behavior by American presidents are much weaker.]{.underline}** **[They
have considerable leeway to use military force]{.underline}** (having
repeatedly circumvented the War Powers Act). **[They can manipulate
public opinion from the Bully Pulpit and shape the flow of
info]{.underline}rmation**. (Think back to the Iraq war.)
**[Congress]{.underline}** typically **[rallies reflexively around the
flag]{.underline}** during international crises. In such moments,
citizens\' criticism or mass protest invites charges of disloyalty. This
is why the brewing conflict in the South China Sea and rising
animosities on both sides could produce something resembling a
Cuban-Missile-Crisis-style situation---with the United States lacking
the geographical advantage this time around. **[If you think that a war
between China and the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tate**[s
couldn't]{.underline}** possibly **[happen, you might have a point in
ordinary times, which these distinctly aren't.]{.underline}**

#### Checks don't apply -- Trump will antagonize China ensuring conflict

**Rachman 3/7** (Gideon, chief foreign affairs columnist for the
Financial Times, "Trump in the China Shop",
http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/07/trump-in-the-china-shop/)

**[The arrival of Donald Trump in the White House threatens a
significant acceleration in the rivalry between the US and
China]{.underline}**. The deliberate but careful attempts of the Obama
administration to push back against Chinese ambitions in the
Asia-Pacific region are likely to be replaced by a new Trump approach
that is much more openly confrontational, and more impulsive **[in
style. Even before taking office, the new US president demonstrated his
willingness to antagonize Beijing]{.underline}**---by speaking directly
to the president of Taiwan, something that all US presidents have
refused to do since the normalization of relations between the United
States and China in the 1970s. **[If a direct military conflict between
China and the United States does break out during the Trump years, the
likeliest arena for a clash is the South China Sea. In his confirmation
hearings before the US Senate, Rex Tillerson, Trump's new secretary of
state, signaled a significant hardening in the American attitude to the
artificial islands that China has been building in the South China
Sea]{.underline}.** Tillerson likened the island building to Russia's
illegal annexation of Crimea and said that the Trump administration
intended to let Beijing know that "your access to those islands is not
going to be allowed." Taken at face value, that sounded like a threat to
blockade the islands, on which China has been constructing military
installations. **[China would almost certainly attempt to break such a
blockade by sea or air. The stage would be set for a modern version of
the Cuba missile crisis. The Chinese government's official reaction to
the Tillerson statement was restrained. But China's state-controlled
media was ferocious.]{.underline}** The Global Times, a nationalist
paper, warned of the possibility of a "large-scale war" between the
United States and China, while the China Daily spoke of a "devastating
confrontation between China and the U.S." Independent observers had come
to similar conclusions. Speaking to me in Davos a couple of days after
Tillerson's statement, Vivian Balakrishnan, the foreign minister of
Singapore, warned that **[any effort at a US blockade in the South China
Sea would lead to a war between the United States and
China.]{.underline}** The Singaporeans, who maintain close ties to both
Washington and Beijing and whose natural style is cautious and
technocratic, are not given to hysteria. In an effort to calm the rising
anxieties in Asia, expressed by the likes of Balakrishnan, James Mattis,
Trump's new defense secretary, used his first trip to the region in
early February to reassure allies that the US is not planning any
"dramatic military moves" in the South China Sea. But there are other
influential voices in the new administration who clearly believe that a
war with China is both inevitable and necessary. Stephen K. Bannon,
chief strategist in the Trump White House, told a radio show in early
2016, **"[We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to ten
years. There is no doubt about that." A decision by President Trump to
confront China over its territorial claims would represent a new
development in the president's thinking, for Trump's most longstanding
and profound concerns about Asia are economic.]{.underline}**
Conventional economic theory has long held that the growing wealth of
Asian nations is a good thing for the United States, since it creates
larger markets for American companies and cheaper goods for American
consumers. But Trump and his advisers emphatically reject this idea.
They blame the stagnation of the living standards of American workers on
"globalism"---otherwise known as international trade and investment.
Bannon argues that "the globalists gutted the American working-class and
created a middle-class in Asia." In his view, the increasing wealth of
Asia, far from being a mutually advantageous process, has impoverished
the United States.

**[Washington and Beijing]{.underline}** have both **[been flexing their

"war between the US and China is now reality]{.underline}**".
**[Warships]{.underline}**, missiles**[, and
nuclear-capable]{.underline}** **[bombers are flooding the
region]{.underline}** as both superpowers prepare for a potentially
nuclear conflict. The cradle of this war zone is the South China Sea
which Beijing claim belongs to the Chinese by right while the US weighs
in support of the Asian power's Pacific neighbours. Experts have warned
**[just one wrong move could cause the region to explode into war
between the US and China]{.underline}**. David L. Goldwyn, a former
special envoy for the US State Department, warned of conflict with China
in a report to the Atlantic Council seen by Daily Star Online. He said:
\"China is prone to testing new US presidents and Mr. **[Trump seems
intent on testing, if not provoking, China]{.underline}**. \"**[A
miscalculation on either side creates a non-negligible risk of military
conflict]{.underline}**."

#### War goes nuclear -- It's probable

**Young 16 (Stephen, fellow @ Union of Concerned Scientists, USA, "The
Risk of Nuclear War with China",
http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/us-china-relations/risk-nuclear-war-china#.WNR8UjvythE)**

**[Could simmering tensions lead to a]{.underline}** full-blown
**[nuclear war]{.underline}**? More specifically: could a minor skirmish
or conventional war escalate into a full-blown nuclear conflict?
Numerous factors suggest that **[it could]{.underline}**---and that
**[the likelihood of nuclear use between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China]{.underline}** may be
**[increasing]{.underline}**. The two countries have a very contentious
history. **[Despite sincere]{.underline}** and occasionally
**[successful efforts to cooperate]{.underline}** on shared concerns
such as climate change and nuclear terrorism, **[lack of mutual trust
sustains an entrenched and deepening antagonism]{.underline}**. Both
governments are preparing for war. Their preparations include
improvements to their nuclear arsenals, including a trillion dollar
investment in the United States. Both governments also believe that a
demonstrable readiness to use military force­---including nuclear
weapons---is needed to ensure the other will yield in a military
confrontation. **[Discussions]{.underline}** of contentious issues
**[are]{.underline}** exceedingly **[inadequate]{.underline}**. **[Their
militaries have produced]{.underline}** shared **[understandings of the
conduct of naval vessels and aircraft]{.underline}**, but **[strategic
dialogues]{.underline}** on nuclear forces, missile defenses, and
anti-satellite weapons **[are limited at best]{.underline}**. United
States and Chinese officials see the risk of nuclear use differently. US
officials believe that if a military conflict starts, nuclear weapons
may be needed to stop it---but Chinese officials assume no nation would
ever invite nuclear retaliation by using nuclear weapons first. Their
only concern is maintaining a credible threat of retaliation. These and
other factors are exacerbated by recent developments between the two
countries, including **[China's]{.underline}** apparent **[move toward
hair-trigger alert]{.underline}**---a policy that **[increases the risk
of accidental nuclear war]{.underline}**, especially in the early days
of its development.

### China War -- AT: Deterrence

#### No deterrence -- Causes extinction

**Wittner 11 (Dr. Lawrence, Professor of History emeritus at
SUNY/Albany, "Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?",
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html)**

At the least, though, don't nuclear weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do
they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't feel deterred, for, throughout the
Cold War, NATO's strategy was to respond to a Soviet conventional
military attack on Western Europe by launching a Western nuclear attack
on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union. Furthermore, **[if U.S. government
officials]{.underline}** really **[believed that]{.underline}** nuclear
**[deterrence worked, they would not have resorted to championing "Star
Wars" and]{.underline}** its modern variant, **[national missile
defense]{.underline}**. Why are these vastly expensive --- and probably
unworkable --- military defense systems needed if other nuclear powers
are deterred from attacking by U.S. nuclear might? Of course, the bottom
line for those Americans convinced that nuclear weapons safeguard them
from a Chinese nuclear attack might be that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is
far greater than its Chinese counterpart. Today, it is estimated that
the U.S. government possesses over 5,000 nuclear warheads, while the
Chinese government has a total inventory of roughly 300. Moreover, only
about 40 of these Chinese nuclear weapons can reach the United States.
Surely **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would
"win" any nuclear war with China. But what would that "victory"
entail]{.underline}**? **[An attack with these Chinese nuclear weapons
would immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans]{.underline}**
in a great storm of blast and fire, while leaving **[many more
dying]{.underline}** horribly **[of sickness and radiation
poisoning]{.underline}**. **[The Chinese death toll]{.underline}** in a
nuclear war **[would be far higher]{.underline}**. **[Both nations would
be]{.underline}** reduced to smoldering, radioactive
**[wastelands.]{.underline}** Also, **[radioactive debris]{.underline}**
sent aloft by the nuclear explosions **[would blot out the sun and bring
on a "nuclear winter]{.underline}**" around the globe --- **[destroying
ag]{.underline}**riculture, **[creating worldwide famine]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** generating chaos and

#### North Korea causes a full-blown nuclear war -- Trump's strategy backfires

**Cohen 4/17 (Ben, Founder and Editor of The Daily Banter, frmr

War III",

This is all to say that there is no Trumpian view of the world \-- it is
just a cynical mishmash of paranoid delusion, miscalculated aggression
and unguided bravado. \'America First\' means whatever Trump feels at
any particular moment, and the rest of us will be left picking up the
pieces. **[In Trump\'s ego based world view, there are no consequences
for American force]{.underline}** \-- **[he can just kick some
ass,]{.underline}** take the glory and leave without worry about what
the CIA refer to as \"blowback\". The \'America First\' philosophy is
based on an infantile assumption that America can take what it wants and
is not responsible for its actions. **[In the reality, other countries
will respond to Trump\'s aggression and hostility in kind, making the
survival of our species all the less likely]{.underline}**. Because
**[in the age of]{.underline}** awesomely destructive **[nuclear
weapons, we can incinerate ourselves in the blink of an
eye]{.underline}**. **[Should Trump keep pushing North
Korea]{.underline}** without regard for the consequences, a **[conflict
could spiral out of control incredibly quickly]{.underline}**. As the
New York Times reported today: What is playing out, said Robert Litwak
of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who tracks this
potentially deadly interplay, is "the Cuban missile crisis in slow
motion." But the slow-motion part appears to be speeding up, as
President **[Trump and his aides have made it clear that the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will no longer
tolerate the incremental advances that have moved]{.underline}** Mr.
**[Kim so close to his goals]{.underline}**\.... While all historical
analogies are necessarily imprecise --- for starters, President John F.
Kennedy dealt with the Soviets and Fidel Castro in a perilous 13 days in
1962, while the roots of the Korean crisis go back a quarter-century ---
one parallel shines through. When national ambitions, personal ego and
deadly weapons are all in the mix, the opportunities for miscalculation
are many. Despite Trump\'s insistence that American dick swinging will
make North Korea give up its nukes, history shows us that the exact
opposite is true. When Bush invaded Iraq (a country with no nuclear
weapons) and threatened North Korea, it prompted Kim Jong Il to ramp up
its nuclear efforts. Faced with more threats today, the hermit kingdom
will almost certainly double down on its efforts to develop more
powerful nuclear weapons again, making the likelihood of a horrendous
accident infinitely more likely, and the consequences of a war even more
deadly. **[Trump is making the world a more dangerous place by the
day]{.underline}**, and if cooler heads do not prevail we may well be on
the cusp of an almighty global conflict that Trump\'s people have wanted
all along.

### North Korea -- Extinction

#### Causes North Korean preemptive nuclear strikes -- The timeframe is short, but solveable

**Talmadge 4/14 (Eric, staff @ Chicago Tribune, "North Korean official:
Ready for war if Trump wants it",
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-north-korea-20170413-story.html)**

President Donald **[Trump\'s tweets are adding fuel to a \"vicious
cycle\" of tensions on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}**, North
Korea\'s vice foreign minister told The Associated Press in an exclusive
interview Friday. The official added that **[if the U.S. shows any sign
of \"reckless\" military aggression, Pyongyang is ready to launch a
pre-emptive strike of its own]{.underline}**. Vice Minister Han Song
Ryol said Pyongyang has determined the Trump administration is \"more
vicious and more aggressive\" than that of Barack Obama. He added that
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea **[will keep building up
its nuclear arsenal in \"quality and quantity\" and]{.underline}** said
Pyongyang is **[ready to go to war if that\'s what Trump
wants]{.underline}**. Tensions between Pyongyang and Washington go back
to President Harry Truman and the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an
armistice, not a peace treaty. But the heat has been rising rapidly
since Trump took office in January. This year\'s joint war games between
the U.S. and South Korean militaries are the biggest so far --- the USS
Carl Vinson aircraft carrier has been diverted back to the waters off
Korea after heading for Australia, and U.S. satellite imagery suggests
the North could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time.
**[Pyongyang recently tested a ballistic missile and claims it is close
to perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear warhead
that could attack the U.S. mainland]{.underline}**. You wouldn\'t let a
little thing like not having a corkscrew stop you from enjoying that
bottle of wine you just bought, right? Watch these videos to see what
lengths people will go to to open a bottle of wine in a pinch. Many
experts believe that at its current pace of testing, **[North Korea
could reach that potentially game-changing milestone within a few
years]{.underline}** --- **[under Trump\'s watch as
president]{.underline}**. Despite reports that Washington is considering
military action if the North goes ahead with another nuclear test, Han
did not rule out the possibility of a test in the near future.

#### Aggression causes North Korea to respond with preemptive nuclear strikes; they've explicitly said so

**[Trump]{.underline}** has not indicated further military action,
though he **[did issue a warning to North Korea]{.underline}** on

the]{.underline}** U.S. military\'s **[decision to drop the largest
non-nuclear weapon]{.underline}**. When asked whether dropping the bomb
sends a message to North Korea as it continues to pursue nuclear and
other weapons, Trump said it makes no difference. \"North Korea is a
problem, the problem will be taken care of,\" Trump said. North Korea\'s
Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol said Friday **[Pyongyang is ready to
launch a preemptive strike if the U.S. shows any sign of \"reckless\"
military aggression]{.underline}**. The foreign minister added that
**[North Korea will keep building up its nuclear arsenal in \"quality

war if that is what Trump wants.]{.underline}**

#### Draws in Russia & China -- Kills millions immediately & collapses relations with China

**Cohen 4/14 (Ben, Founder and Editor of The Daily Banter, frmr
Huffington Post, "Er, is Trump About to Kick Off World War III?",
http://thedailybanter.com/2017/04/er-is-trump-about-to-kick-off-world-war-iii/)**

Just for fun, let\'s do a quick list as to why attacking North Korea is
a very, very bad idea: 1. **[North Korea will respond,
and]{.underline}** it will almost certainly **[attack South
Korea]{.underline}**. While it is unclear who would win should conflict
arise, **[North Korea\'s enormous army and possession of nuclear weapons
means both sides would incur extreme losses if violence
escalated]{.underline}**. As the New York Times notes: **[In the event
of war]{.underline}**, **[North Korean plans are]{.underline}**
**[thought to call for nuclear attacks against major ports and air bases
in South Korea and Japan, halting any American invasion before it could
fully begin]{.underline}**. In the meantime, nuclear and chemical
strikes against major population centers would be intended to shock the
world into capitulating. Missile defense would be of limited use against
short-range rockets and of no use against North Korea's hundreds of
artillery pieces, many of which target Seoul, the South Korean capital.
Not good. 2. **[Hitting North Korea would irreversibly damage relations
with China]{.underline}**. President Xi has already informed Trump that
destabilizing the region with an attack would be a huge problem for
China due to the number of refugees it would create, and they would seek
retribution against American in one form or another. 3. **[An attack
would almost certainly spur Russia to side with China and orchestrate a
co-ordinated response that would play itself out]{.underline}**
elsewhere. It is not in the interests of the United States to fight a
Cold (or real) war with Russia and China given both are geopolitical
power houses with rapidly growing economies and militaries to match. It
is clear that Trump\'s aggressive posture towards North Korea is a giant
distraction from his rapid succession of domestic failures and
plummeting poll numbers. He has bombed Afghanistan with the biggest
non-nuclear weapon in America\'s arsenal and now sent war ships to
threaten North Korea \-- all of this after only three months in office.
Creating conflict abroad is a classic technique used by strongmen (and
women) throughout history, but rarely has it been as stupidly executed
and poorly disguised. **[Trump is blundering full steam ahead into a
quagmire he is not capable of comprehending]{.underline}** let alone
extricate the US from. He apparently only learned from the Chinese
president that the situation in North Korea was \"not so easy\", and yet
has gone ahead anyway with the proverbial nuclear option. As with
everything Donald Trump related, **[this won\'t end well]{.underline}**
so let\'s hope cooler heads prevail and the international community
comes together to put a stop to what could well be the beginnings of a
global conflict we likely won\'t recover from.

#### Aggression causes all-out nuclear war -- Timeframe is short

**Deutsche Welle 4/15 ("North Korea vows to respond to US aggression
with \'nuclear attack\'",
http://www.dw.com/en/north-korea-vows-to-respond-to-us-aggression-with-nuclear-attack/a-38435453)**

**[With the US Navy deployed near the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}**,
and experts speculating that Pyongyang was preparing another nuclear
test, **[the tensions have been rising]{.underline}** in recent days.
The huge military parade on Saturday showed off what appeared to be the
country\'s increasingly sophisticated military hardware, including
ballistic missiles, to the accompaniment of marching music and a large
audience. \"**[We will respond to an all-out war with an all-out war and
a nuclear war with our style of nuclear attack]{.underline}**,\" Choe
Ryong Hae, a top North Korean officer, said. Choe is considered by
outside analysts to be the country\'s most powerful official after the
leader Kim Jong Un. US President Donald **[Trump\'s recent bombings in
Syria and Afghanistan have stoked fears about a possible US attack on
North Korea]{.underline}**. **[The communist country has been regularly
conducting nuclear and missile tests]{.underline}** defying United
Nations\' resolutions and sanctions. Previously, **[the North Korean
military threatened to unleash a \"merciless\" response against American
targets, including the naval task force the US recently
deployed]{.underline}**. \"**[The closer such big targets]{.underline}**
as nuclear powered aircraft carriers come**[, the greater would be the
effect of merciless strikes]{.underline}**,\" according to the statement
carried by the KCNA news agency. At the same time, the army urged
Washington to \"come to its senses\" and find a \"proper\" solution to
the current stand-off. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday
\"everybody will end up as a loser\" if a war breaks out on the Korean
Peninsula. All sides need to show restraint, he added, or risk the
situation getting out of hand. \"One has the feeling that a **[conflict
could break out at any moment]{.underline}**,\" Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi said after meeting his French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault.

#### Attacks ensure use-it-or-lose-it pressure for preemptive strikes

**Stafford 1-4 (Tim, Research Fellow with Pacific Forum-Centre for
Strategic and International Studies, "Donald Trump's Misguided Nuclear
Proposals",
https://rusi.org/commentary/donald-trumps-misguided-nuclear-proposals)**

**[The concept of M]{.underline}**utually **[A]{.underline}**ssured
**[D]{.underline}**estruction **[rested upon the inevitability of a
retaliatory response]{.underline}** to any first strike nuclear attack,
something enhanced by the heightened survivability afforded by large
arsenals. Indeed, **[one of the dangers that plagues many of today's
deterrence relationships is the absence of such a
dynamic]{.underline}**. Defence planners in Moscow fear that Russia's
second-strike capacity could be neutralised by the increasing
effectiveness of US missile defences. Likewise, **[the small nature of
the North Korea's nuclear arsenal means that any major military
contingency on the peninsula could confront the Kim regime with a 'use
it or lose it' dilemma that would incentivise first-use.]{.underline}**

#### China gets drawn in, causes global nuclear war

**Dyer 4/13 (Gwynne, London-based independent journalist, "'Solving'
North Korea",
https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2017/04/13/solving-north-korea/)**

This does not necessarily mean that the US would launch a large nuclear
attack against North Korea. If you are really serious about carrying out
a "disarming strike" that destroys all of North Korea's nukes, you
probably should do exactly that (You never get a second chance to go
first). But **[maybe the US Air Force would promise that "precision"
non-nuclear weapons could accomplish that goal]{.underline}** and maybe
some gullible people would believe it. It **[would still turn into a
nuclear war]{.underline}** in the end, unless American "surgical
strikes" miraculously eliminated every last one of North Korea's nukes
at the same time. **[Kim]{.underline}** Jong-un'**[s regime would find
itself in the position known in nuclear strategy as "use them or lose
them"]{.underline}** and it is hard to believe that it would not launch
whatever it had left. The targets would be in South Korea, of course,
but probably also American bases in Japan. Maybe even Japanese cities,
if North Korea had enough weapons left. The regime would know it was
going under -- **[the US would not take this huge risk and then leave it
in power]{.underline}** -- so it would take as many of its enemies as
possible down with it. North America would probably not be hit, because
Western intelligence services do not believe that Pyongyang has
ballistic missiles that can reach that far yet. (But "intelligence" is
not the same as knowing for sure, and they could be wrong.) At worst,
the victims would be one or two cities in the Pacific north-west of the
US. This would be a very bad outcome for people living in Seattle or
Portland, but it would not actually be a "nuclear holocaust". The kind
of war that the superpowers would have fought at the height of the Cold
War, with thousands of nuclear weapons used by each side, would have
killed hundreds of millions and might even have triggered a "nuclear
winter". A nuclear war over Korea would be a much smaller catastrophe,
perhaps involving a few million deaths -- unless China got drawn in.
Unfortunately, that is not inconceivable, because
**[China,]{.underline}** **[much as it dislikes and mistrusts the North
Korean regime]{.underline}**, **[is determined not to see it
destroyed]{.underline}**. Many people are uncomfortable with this kind
of analysis, especially when it draws comparisons between "bad" and
"less bad" nuclear wars. Herman Kahn, the dean of nuclear strategists in
the 1960s and 70s, was frequently the target of this kind of criticism:
how could he talk about potential mass death in such a cold-blooded way?
His response was always the same: "Would you prefer a nice, warm
mistake?" "Thinking About the Unthinkable", as he put it in one of his
books, is absolutely necessary if the Unthinkable is not happen. In this
case, **[that means taking the possibility that China might be drawn
into the conflict seriously]{.underline}**. **[The destruction of the
North Korean regime would bring American military power right to China's
own border]{.underline}**. You might reasonably ask: So what? This is
the 21st Century and what matters strategically is the big, lethal
long-range weapons (like nukes), not the whereabouts of a few American
infantry battalions. Quite right in theory. Not necessarily right in
practice. During the Korean War, when American troops were operating
very close to the Chinese frontier in late 1950, the Chinese regime sent
troops in to save the North Korean regime --- and succeeded. The
scenario this time, with nuclear weapons already being used on both
sides of the North Korea-South Korea frontier, would be different, but
it could be even more dangerous. **[China has lots of nuclear weapons
and delivery vehicles too]{.underline}**.

China's top leader. **[X]{.underline}**i wants to be seen as a steady

Beijing will respond]{.underline}**. **[China will leverage its own

Korean President Park Geun-hye will probably be replaced by a
progressive figure espousing engagement with Pyongyang and more
multilateral regional security approaches. This could position Beijing
to contain and ultimately reverse U.S. THAAD deployments. Overall,

https://thediplomat.com/2017/02/the-us-japan-and-trade-what-trump-can-learn-from-the-1990s/

As U.S. President Donald Trump's summit with Japan's Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe approaches, the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
**[should reflect on the risk of allowing the U.S.-Japan alliance to
fall into disrepair over disputes about trade]{.underline}** and
host-nation support. In particular, the president should consider the
early experience of the Clinton administration in Asia.

President Bill **[Clinton]{.underline}** initially **[took a hardline
approach on the U.S. trade deficit with Japan]{.underline}** and
prioritized extracting economic concessions from Tokyo. **[Before long,
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[found]{.underline}** itself struggling to repair **[a strained,
weakened alliance at the moment it needed this partnership most, with
crises breaking out on the Korean peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait.
With present day Asia increasingly on edge facing mounting threats from
North Korea and China, the current administration would be well-advised
to learn from]{.underline}** the Clinton administration's **[early
mistakes and reinforce rather than undermine its alliance with
Japan]{.underline}**.

The President's Position: "It's a Very Unfair Situation."

Although many members of Trump's administration -- including Defense
Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- emphasize
the need for a strong alliances around the world, Trump has long been
critical of the U.S.-Japan alliance. In particular, the president argues
that Japan is free-riding on American beneficence, and should foot the
entire bill for U.S. forces stationed in Japan while opening its market
to U.S. exports and addressing its trade surplus with the United States.
He expressed these convictions 30 years ago in a full-page ad in the
Washington Post and the New York Times criticizing Japan for "taking
advantage of the United States" because the United States was obligated
to defend Japan "for free" while Japan "managed to maintain a weak yen
against a strong dollar."

Trump maintains these views today. Throughout his 2016 campaign, the
future president castigated Japan, claiming that the United States is
"getting absolutely crushed on trade" with its longstanding ally while
"losing a fortune" by basing U.S. forces in Japan (although Japan is one
of the leading providers of host-nation support among the United States'
many allies). More recently, **[Trump claimed that U.S. relations with
Japan are unfair, accusing Tokyo of manipulating the yen and using
non-tariff barriers to undermine U.S. auto exports]{.underline}**.

To address these imbalances, **[the president has promised to ramp up
pressure on Japan]{.underline}**. He has gone as far as to suggest that
he would renegotiate the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, or even dissolve
the alliance and withdraw U.S. troops if his demands are not met.
**[These comments have set Japan -- and other U.S. allies -- on
edge]{.underline}**. Mattis' recent **[diplomatic
outreach]{.underline}** to Tokyo and Seoul **[may prove
insufficient]{.underline}** to offset the damage these threats will do
to U.S. security partnerships in the region.

What will be the consequences if the president doubles down on this
hardline approach to imbalances in the U.S.-Japan relationship and
prioritizes economics over military cooperation? History offers a useful
guide. There are parallels between the Trump administration's proposed
approach and the stance taken by the Clinton administration in its first
term. Unfortunately, **[the travails of]{.underline}** the Clinton
administration's **[attempts to correct economic imbalances in the
U.S.-Japan alliance suggest]{.underline}** that the current
administration's proposed **[policy may do considerably more harm than
good]{.underline}**.

Hard Lessons From the Past: The Clinton Administration

The Clinton administration came to office in 1993 with one overriding
objective: economic growth ("it's the economy stupid!" as the famous
slogan went). One of its top priorities abroad was to reduce the U.S.
trade deficit with Japan. The Cold War was over and some members of the
administration believed that Washington, freed from its life-or-death
struggle with the Soviet Union, could afford to play hardball with
allies like Japan that had benefited from American largesse in the past.
Clinton's decision to announce the economic component of his vision for
a "New Pacific Community" in Tokyo prior to detailing the security
component later in the week in Seoul highlighted this new set of
priorities toward Japan.

Clinton quickly began working on the U.S.-Japan Framework for New
Economic Partnership in an attempt to facilitate aggressive new
negotiations with Japan over its trade imbalances. But this attempt did
not get far. American trade representatives demanded quotas on sensitive
U.S. products, particularly autos. Japanese negotiators dug in their
heels. By 1995, after years of caustic feuding over trade, the allies
stood on the brink of a trade war with relations frayed and security
cooperation neglected. Faced with intractable opposition from the
Japanese, the Clinton administration had little choice but to
compromise, discarding most of their initial demands.

**[As the alliance was battered by]{.underline}** these **[trade
disputes, chaos erupted throughout Asia]{.underline}**. On the Korean
peninsula, **[North Korea]{.underline}** threatened to leave the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and **[began reprocessing]{.underline}**
plutonium. **[The crisis escalated, preventive strikes were
considered]{.underline}**, and Northeast Asia stood on edge. Yet as
tensions roiled in Northeast Asia, **[the U.S.-Japan alliance,
languishing from]{.underline}** neglect amid **[the trade spat, was ill
prepared to respond. While]{.underline}** the general consensus was that
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would need
Japan's]{.underline}** support in a Korean contingency -- its
**[bases]{.underline}**, its **[ports]{.underline}**, its
**[airfields]{.underline}**, its **[logistics support,
and]{.underline}** possibly its **[combat forces -- the alliance was not
prepared to provide this support]{.underline}**. As the US ambassador to
Japan put it, the incident highlighted critical "fault lines" in the
alliance. The United States managed to resolve the North Korea crisis
temporarily through the Agreed Framework, but it was clear **[the
neglected U.S.-Japan security alliance was in dire need of an
upgrade]{.underline}**.

As tensions in Korea eased, **[another crisis erupted in]{.underline}**
the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** Strait **[that]{.underline}** similarly
**[caught the alliance flat-footed]{.underline}**. After a visit by
Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian to the United States, China
retaliated with a massive and bellicose display of Chinese military
might in the Taiwan Strait. The United States, committed to peace in the
strait under the Taiwan Relations Act, was able to resolve the crisis
with a reciprocal show of force, sailing two U.S. carrier battle groups
through the East China Sea. Nonetheless, the U.S.-Japan alliance was
left shaken and uncertain. Could the United States count on Japan's
support in a potential contingency in Taiwan? Would Japan allow U.S.
forces operating out of Okinawa to assist Taiwan in the event of a
Chinese attack? Was the alliance well-suited to confront a more
assertive and powerful China? Neither ally could answer these questions
with a high degree of confidence. The emphasis on feuds over auto
exports and the consequent neglect of security had left both allies
unprepared for the challenges of a new and changing Asia-Pacific.

Through careful statecraft, the Clinton administration was able to
reverse the early setbacks of its strategy in Asia. Later diplomacy
emphasized Washington's need for a strong, secure partnership with Tokyo
and its other regional allies. The Nye Initiative and the subsequent
revision of the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation provided a
much needed reorientation in U.S. Asia policy, helping to cement the
U.S.-Japan alliance as the lynchpin for regional security and stability
for years to come.

The United States Can't Go It Alone

**[Trump must heed the lessons]{.underline}** of the Clinton
administration **[if the United States is to secure its interests in
Asia. Now is not the time to focus on]{.underline}** fiscal and
**[economic imbalances with Japan to the detriment of security ties.
Tensions are rising again on the Korean peninsula, with North Korea

### Trade -- Japan -- Relations

#### Trade disputes undermine [overall]{.underline} relations and [divert focus]{.underline} from security cooperation

**Cooper 14** -- William H. Cooper, Specialist in International Trade
and Finance at the Congressional Research Service, "U.S.-Japan Economic
Relations: Significance, Prospects, and Policy Options", CRS Report,
2-18, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32649.pdf

**[Japan and the United States are two major economic
powers]{.underline}**. Together they account for over 30% of world
domestic product, for a significant portion of international trade in
goods and services, and for a major portion of international investment.
This economic clout makes the United States and Japan potentially
powerful actors in the world economy. Economic conditions in the United
States and Japan have a significant impact on the rest of the world.
Furthermore, **[the U.S.-Japan bilateral economic relationship can
influence economic conditions in other countries]{.underline}**. **[The
U.S.-Japan economic relationship is strong and mutually advantageous.
The two economies are highly integrated via trade in goods and
services]{.underline}**---they are large markets for each other's
exports and important sources of imports. More importantly, Japan and
the United States are closely connected via capital flows. Japan is a
major foreign source of financing of the U.S. national debt and will
likely remain so for the foreseeable future, as the mounting U.S. public
debt needs to be financed and the stock of U.S. domestic savings remains
insufficient to meet the investment needs. Japan is also a significant
source of foreign private portfolio and direct investment in the United
States, and the United States is the origin of much of the foreign
investment in Japan. The relative significance of Japan and the United
States as each other's economic partner has diminished. This trend is
due in part to the rise of China and other emerging economic powers. For
example, China has overtaken Japan as the largest source of foreign
financing of the U.S. national debt. Nevertheless, **[analyses of trade
and other economic data suggest that the bilateral relationship remains
important, and policy leaders from both countries face the challenge of
how to manage it]{.underline}**. The trend is also due to the mediocre
performance of the Japanese economy over the last two decades, which was
exacerbated by the global economic slowdown beginning in 2008, and other
setbacks, including the tsunami, earthquake, and nuclear accidents that
occurred in March 2011. Japan is still struggling to achieve sustained
economic recovery. However, **[during the last decade, U.S. and Japanese
policy leaders seem to have made a deliberate effort to drastically
reduce the friction that prevailed in the economic relationship during
the 1970s, 1980s, and the first half of the 1990s]{.underline}**. On the
one hand, **[this calmer environment has stabilized the bilateral
relationship and permitted the two countries to focus their attention on
other issues of mutual interest, such as national security. On the other
hand,]{.underline}** as some have argued, **[the friendlier environment
masks serious problems that require more attention, such as Japan's
continuing failure to resolve long-standing market access barriers to
U.S. exports. Failure to resolve any of these outstanding issues could
heighten friction between the two countries.]{.underline}**

### Trade -- Japan -- Alliance

#### Strong US/Japan alliance solves multiple scenarios for global nuclear conflict

Defense University. The United States and Japan: Advancing Toward a
Mature Partnership, October,
http://www.ndu.edu/inss/strforum/SR_01/SR_Japan.htm)

Major war in Europe is inconceivable for at least a generation, but the
**[prospects for conflict in Asia are far from remote. The region
features some of the world's largest and most modern armies,
nuclear-armed major powers, and several nuclear-capable states.
Hostilities that could directly involve the United States in a major
conflict could occur at a moments notice on the Korean peninsula and in
the Taiwan Strait. The Indian subcontinent is a major flashpoint. In
each area, war has the potential of nuclear escalation]{.underline}**.
In addition, **[lingering turmoil in Indonesia]{.underline}**, the
world's fourth-largest nation, **[threatens stability in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}**. The United States is tied to the region by a series
of bilateral security alliances that remain the regions de facto
security architecture. In this promising but also potentially dangerous
setting, the **[U.S.-Japan]{.underline}** bilateral
**[relations]{.underline}**hip **[is more important than ever.
With]{.underline}** the world's second-largest economy and **[a
well-equipped]{.underline}** and competent **[military, and as

U.S. involvement in Asia. The U.S.-Japan alliance is central to
America's global security strategy]{.underline}**.

#### Alliance stops Korea war, piracy, terrorism, cyber attacks, prolif, and global war

**Gates 11** -- Robert, U.S. Secretary of Defense, "[U.S.-Japan Alliance
a Cornerstone of Asian
Security](http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1529)",
Speech to Keio University, 1-14,
http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1529

Over the course of its history, [the U.S.-Japan alliance has succeeded
at its original core purpose -- to deter military aggression and provide
an umbrella of security under which]{.underline} Japan -- and [the
region -- can prosper. Today]{.underline}, our [alliance]{.underline} is
growing deeper and broader as we [address a range of security
challenges]{.underline} in Asia. Some, [like **North Korea**,
**piracy**]{.underline} or **[natural disasters]{.underline}**, have
been around for decades, centuries, or since the beginning of time.
Others, such as [**global terrorist networks**, **cyber attacks**, and
**nuclear proliferation**]{.underline} are of a more recent vintage.
What [these issues]{.underline} have in common is that they all [require
multiple nations working together -- and]{.underline} they also almost
always require [leadership and involvement by key]{.underline} regional
[players such as the U.S. and Japan]{.underline}. In turn, we express
our shared values by increasing our alliance's capacity to provide
humanitarian aid and disaster relief, take part in peace-keeping
operations, protect the global commons, and promote cooperation and
build trust through strengthening regional institutions. Everyone
gathered here knows the crippling devastation that can be caused by
natural disasters -- and the U.S. and Japan, along with our partners in
the region, recognize that responding to these crises is a security
imperative. In recent years, U.S. and Japanese forces delivered aid to
remote earthquake-stricken regions on Indonesia, and U.S. aircraft based
in Japan helped deliver assistance to typhoon victims in Burma. We
worked together in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami,
earthquakes in Java, Sumatra, and Haiti, and most recently following the
floods in Pakistan. These efforts have demonstrated the forward
deployment of U.S. forces in Japan is of real and life-saving value.
They also provide new opportunities for the U.S. and Japanese forces to
operate together by conducting joint exercises and missions.
Furthermore, U.S. and Japanese troops have been working on the global
stage to confront the threat of failed or failing states. Japanese
peacekeepers have operated around the world, including the Golan Heights
and East Timor and assisted with the reconstruction of Iraq. In
Afghanistan, Japan represents the second largest financial donor, making
substantive contributions to the international effort by funding the
salaries of the Afghan National Police and helping the Afghan government
integrate former insurgents. Japan and the United States also continue
to cooperate closely to ensure the maritime commons are safe and secure
for commercial traffic. Our maritime forces work hand-in-glove in the
Western Pacific as well as in other sea passages such as the Strait of
Malacca between Malaysia and Indonesia, where more than a third of the
world's oil and trade shipments pass through every year. Around the Horn
of Africa, Japan has deployed surface ships and patrol aircraft that
operate alongside those from all over the world drawn by the common goal
to counter piracy in vital sea lanes. Participating in these activities
thrusts Japan's military into a relatively new, and at times sensitive
role, as an exporter of security. This is a far cry from the situation
of even two decades ago when, as I remember well as a senior national
security official, Japan was criticized for so-called "checkbook
diplomacy" -- sending money but not troops -- to help the anti-Saddam
coalition during the First Gulf War. By showing more willingness to send
self-defense forces abroad under international auspices -- consistent
with your constitution -- Japan is taking its rightful place alongside
the world's other great democracies. That is part of the rationale for
Japan's becoming a permanent member of a reformed United Nations
Security Council. And since these challenges cannot be tackled through
bilateral action alone, [we must use the strong U.S.-Japanese
partnership as a platform to do more to strengthen multilateral
institutions]{.underline} -- regional arrangements that must be
inclusive, transparent, and focused on results. Just a few months ago, I
attended the historic first meeting of the ASEAN Plus Eight Defense
Ministers Meeting in Hanoi, and am encouraged by Japan's decision to
co-chair the Military Medicine Working Group. And as a proud Pacific
nation, the United States will take over the chairmanship of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum this year, following Japan's
successful tenure. Working through regional and international forums
puts our alliance in the best position to confront some of Asia's
toughest security challenges. As we have been reminded once again in
recent weeks, none has proved to be more vexing and enduring than North
Korea. Despite the hopes and best efforts of the South Korean
government, the U.S. and our allies, and the international community,
the character and priorities of the North Korean regime sadly have not
changed. North Korea's ability to launch another conventional ground
invasion is much degraded from even a decade or so ago, but in other
respects it has grown more lethal and destabilizing. Today, it is [North
Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and proliferation]{.underline} of
nuclear know-how and ballistic missile equipment that [have
focused]{.underline} our [attention -- developments]{.underline} that
[threaten]{.underline} not just the peninsula, but the Pacific Rim and
**[international stability]{.underline}** as well. In response to a
series of provocations -- the most recent being the sinking of the
Cheonan and North Korea's lethal shelling of a South Korean island --
Japan has stood shoulder to shoulder with the Republic of Korea and the
United States. Our three countries continue to deepen our ties through
the Defense Trilateral Talks -- the kind of multilateral engagement
among America's long-standing allies that the U.S. would like to see
strengthened and expanded over time. When and if North Korea's behavior
gives us any reasons to believe that negotiations can be conducted
productively and in good faith, we will work with Japan, South Korea,
Russia, and China to resume engagement with North Korea through the six
party talks. The first step in the process should be a North-South
engagement. But, to be clear, the North must also take concrete steps to
honor its international obligations and comply with U.N. Security
Council Resolutions. Any progress towards diffusing the crisis on the
Korean Peninsula must include the active support of the People's
Republic of China -- where, as you probably know, I just finished an
official visit. China has been another important player whose economic
growth has fueled the prosperity of this part of the world, but
questions about its intentions and opaque military modernization program
have been a source of concern to its neighbors. Questions about China's
growing role in the region manifest themselves in territorial disputes
-- most recently in the incident in September near the Senkaku Islands,
an incident that served as a reminder of the important of America's and
Japan's treaty obligations to one another. The U.S. position on maritime
security remains clear: we have a national interest in freedom of
navigation; in unimpeded economic development and commerce; and in
respect for international law. We also believe that customary
international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea, provides clear guidance on the appropriate use of the maritime
domain, and rights of access to it. Nonetheless, I disagree with those
who portray China as an inevitable strategic adversary of the United
States. We welcome a China that plays a constructive role on the world
stage. In fact, the goal of my visit was to improve our
military-to-military relationship and outline areas of common interest.
It is precisely because we have questions about China's military -- just
as they might have similar questions about the United States -- that I
believe a healthy dialogue is needed. Last fall, President Obama and
President Hu Jin Tao made a commitment to advance sustained and reliable
defense ties, not a relationship repeatedly interrupted by and subject
to the vagaries of political weather. On a personal note, one of the
things I learned from my experience dealing with the Soviet Union during
my earlier time in government was the importance of maintaining a
strategic dialogue and open lines of communication. Even if specific
agreements did not result -- on nuclear weapons or anything else -- this
dialogue helped us understand each other better and lessen the odds of
misunderstanding and miscalculation. The Cold War is mercifully long
over and the circumstances with China today are vastly different -- but
the importance of maintaining dialogue is as important today. For the
last few minutes I've discussed some of the most pressing security
challenges -- along with the most fruitful areas of regional cooperation
-- facing the U.S. and Japan in Asia. This environment -- in terms of
threats and opportunities -- is markedly different than the conditions
that led to the forging of the U.S-Japan defense partnership in the
context of a rivalry between two global superpowers. But on account of
the scope, complexity and lethality of these challenges, I would argue
that our alliance is more necessary, more relevant, and more important
than ever. And maintaining the vitality and credibility of the alliance
requires modernizing our force posture and other defense arrangements to
better reflect the threats and military requirements of this century.
For example, North Korea's ballistic missiles -- along with the
proliferation of these weapons to other countries -- require a more
effective alliance missile defense capability. The U.S.-Japan
partnership in missile defense is already one of the most advanced of
its kind in the world. It was American and Japanese AEGIS ships that
together monitored the North Korean missile launches of 2006 and 2008.
This partnership --which relies on mutual support, cutting edge
technology, and information sharing -- in many ways reflect our alliance
at its best. The U.S. and Japan have nearly completed the joint
development of a new advanced interceptor, a system that represents a
qualitative improvement in our ability to thwart any North Korean
missile attack. The co-location of our air- and missile-defense commands
at Yokota -- and the associated opportunities for information sharing,
joint training, and coordination in this area -- provide enormous value
to both countries. As I alluded to earlier, advances by the Chinese
military in cyber and anti-satellite warfare pose a potential challenge
to the ability of our forces to operate and communicate in this part of
the Pacific. Cyber attacks can also come from any direction and from a
variety of sources -- state, non-state, or a combination thereof -- in
ways that could inflict enormous damage to advanced, networked
militaries and societies. Fortunately, the U.S. and Japan maintain a
qualitative edge in satellite and computer technology -- an advantage we
are putting to good use in developing ways to counter threats to the
cyber and space domains. Just last month, the Government of Japan took
another step forward in the evolution of the alliance by releasing its
National Defense Program Guidelines -- a document that lays out a vision
for Japan's defense posture. These guidelines envision: A more mobile
and deployable force structure; Enhanced Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance capabilities; and A shift in focus to Japan's southwest
islands. These new guidelines provide an opportunity for even deeper
cooperation between our two countries -- and the emphasis on your
southwestern islands underscores the importance of our alliance's force
posture. And this is a key point. Because even as the alliance continues
to evolve -- in strategy, posture, and military capabilities -- to deal
with this century's security challenges, a critical component will
remain the forward presence of U.S. military forces in Japan.
[Without]{.underline} such [a presence]{.underline}: [North Korea's
military provocations could be even more outrageous \-- or
worse]{.underline}; [China might behave more assertively towards its
neighbors]{.underline}; It would take longer to evacuate civilians
affected by conflict or natural disasters in the region; It would be
more difficult and costly to conduct robust joint exercises -- such as
the recent Keen Sword exercise -- that hone the U.S. and Japanese
militaries ability to operate and, if necessary, fight together; and
Without the forward presence of U.S. forces in Japan, [there would be
less information sharing and coordination, and we would know less about
regional threats and]{.underline} the military [capabilities
of]{.underline} our potential [adversaries]{.underline}.

#### Base support is inev -- they're authoritarians.

University, "Trump's Base: They Are Authoritarians", Verdict, 3-2-18,
https://verdict.justia.com/2018/03/02/trumps-base-authoritarians

For weeks now, I have been reading studies examining **[Trump's
base]{.underline}**, those **[core supporters who are with him
notwithstanding his conspicuous incompetence]{.underline}** as President
of the United States, **[and the resulting chaos his lack of leadership
has created]{.underline}**. Trump's base is not solely (although it
includes) those people who are reported in polls on his job approval,
for with the better polls these are randomly selected people. Rather
**[these are the people who are prepared to vote for him in 2020, and
vote in 2018 for congressional candidates who support
Trump]{.underline}** and his administration's policies. **[The
core]{.underline}** supporters of Trump's presidency **[are the people
who were attracted to Trump from Republican primaries]{.underline}**,
those **[who wanted him to take down established
candidates]{.underline}**. It takes very little digging to find that
these **[voters liked his political incorrectness]{.underline}**, and
**[many]{.underline}** had **[first noticed him when he began
attacking]{.underline}** President **[Obama as]{.underline}** an
**[illegitimate]{.underline}** president: Trump's conspiracy theory
about Obama being born in Kenya, thus not a "natural born" citizen of
the United States, who could become president. It is easy to forget that
the eight years of the Obama presidency (2009--2017) was a very
difficult time for many white Americans, and these years witnessed a
significant political realignment in the United States. The racial
schisms that Nixon, Reagan, and the Bushes played on with their southern
strategies, which reshaped the Republican Party in the South and rural
areas, became a racial divide during Obama's years in the White House.
Americans became totally polarized. These changes commenced in the
immediate aftermath of Barack Obama's election. For example, Kaylon
Johnson experienced them first-hand. He had been an Obama volunteer and
was still smiling and wearing an Obama t-shirt just days after Obama's
win, when he stopped at his regular Shreveport, Louisiana, gas station
in his GMC Yukon utility vehicle, which displayed an Obama bumper
sticker. After purchasing gas and a soft drink, Kaylon was attacked by
three white men shouting obscenities at him, including "Fuck Obama" and
"No \[n-word\] President." They pummeled Johnson, sending him to the
emergency room with a broken nose and fractured eye socket that required
surgery. There were countless such incidents, along with cross-burnings,
and not only in the South but throughout the country. At the University
of Kentucky, a life-sized likeness of Obama was hanged from a noose in a
tree. Racist graffiti was spray-painted from Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, to Springfield, Massachusetts, to Tacoma, Washington. Southern
school children chanted: "Assassinate Obama/Assassinate
Obama/Assassinate Obama." The Secret Service arrested a Wisconsin man
who announced his plans online to kill Obama, and Neo-Nazi radio host
Hal Turner shared his dream of an unmanned drone or chemical-filled
balloons killing Obama and all those attending his forthcoming
inauguration. Obama's election and presidency provoked ugly racist
reactions by a startling number of conservative Republicans, both
leaders and followers. Openly racist conservatives, men and women,
shamelessly viewed the Obama White House as a call to arms and actions.
Like a cancer escaping remission, racism reemerged in America with a
vengeance, with its practitioners, promoters and organizers using the
internet to invigorate once largely dormant organizations like Ku Klux
Klan and the Council of Conservative Citizens, and to create new groups,
including online gatherings like the Confederate Pride website,
attracting men and women who rejected mainstream American conservatism
to embrace white nationalism and white supremacy, antifeminism,
homophobia, nativism, anti-immigration and Islamophobia. In addition,
here was a resurgence of neo-Nazi groups that embraced white supremacy
and xenophobia along with anti-Semitism. These groups were soon referred
to as "the alternative right," as early as 2008, later morphing into the
label "Alt Right." Local, state and national politicians in the South
were often ahead of their constituents in reacting to Obama's election
in plotting and planning how to defeat if not end his presidency. As
President Obama and wife Michelle danced at his inauguration ball,
fifteen of the most powerful members of the Republican Party, top GOP
lawmakers and strategists, gathered at the Caucus Room Restaurant in
Washington for a private dinner to consider ways to subvert Obama's
presidency. Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced that his agenda
was to make certain Obama was a one-term president who accomplished
little. Less than a month after Obama's inauguration, on February 19,
2009, CNBC reporter Rick Santelli gave an on-camera rant from the floor
of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange opposing President Obama's stimulus
package to deal with a tanking economy, and along his way calling for a
"tea party" in Lake Michigan. News reporters played and replayed the
rant, which caught the attention of some conservative activists, who by
conference call agreed to start protesting Obama's agenda. Unknowingly,
Santelli and the news media had ignited a movement. The Tea Party was
born. Soon, nationwide demonstrations erupted, largely spontaneously,
and organizers kept them going. (See, e.g., Scott Rasmussen and Doug
Schoen, Mad As Hell: How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally
Remaking Our Two-Party System (New York: Harper Collins Publishers,
2020); Theda Skocpol and Venessa Williamson, The Tea Party and the
Remaking of Republican Conservatism (New York: Oxford University Press,
2012); Nella Van Dyke and David S. Meyer (eds.), Understanding the Tea
Party Movement (New York: Routledge, 2016).) The discomfort of the Alt
Right and Tea Party with an African American in the White House was not
lost on Donald Trump, and in early 2011 he reached out to a leading
right-wing conspiracy theorist who claimed Obama was not a natural-born
American, rather from Kenya. Trump quickly became "birtherism's" most
outspoken champion. And the racism of the Alt Right, Tea Party, and
other conservatives discovered Trump. This race-based support would take
him all the way to the White House, and it remains the foundation of his
support. (Of course, he cannot appear openly racist, so he has a few
token African Americans in his otherwise lily-white administration,
e.g., Omarosa Manigault, for a while, and Ben Carson, for a while
longer.) There are **[other factors]{.underline}**, of course, that
**[solidified and united the people who elected Trump, and retain them
as his core supporters. These include]{.underline}** the development of
**[social media]{.underline}** on the internet (Trump without Twitter
would be unable to communicate with these people), **[and]{.underline}**
the growing availability of **[dark and hidden money in the presidential
election process]{.underline}** following the landmark ruling of the US
Supreme Court in Citizens United vs. FEC, decided on January 21, 2010.
This split decision by the High Court changed the political landscape.
Without Citizens United, Donald Trump would not be president because
this new money not only funded his campaign, but it enabled disparate
groups of like-thinking people to operate as a unified force. **[While
the news media at least took notice of the]{.underline}** people who
were organizing to support Trump during his campaign---most of whom have
remained among his **[core supporters]{.underline}**---**[the reason
these people support Trump has been widely misunderstood if not totally
ignored]{.underline}**, although not by everyone. For example, on
January 17, 2016, as Trump's campaign was weathering storm after storm,
looking like it might sink, Politico published a brief article by
Matthew **[MacWilliams]{.underline}**, founder of a small upstart
political communications firm and a political science PhD candidate at
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. **[MacWilliams noticed that
the work on his dissertation appeared to be playing out in the Trump
campaign]{.underline}**. Speaking with his academic voice, **[he wrote:
"I've found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether
a voter supports Trump]{.underline}**---and it's not race, income or
education levels: **[It's authoritarianism]{.underline}**." His finding
was based on a national poll sponsored by University of Massachusetts,
asking questions about authoritarianism that other pollsters were
ignoring. Based on his findings, he urged other pollsters to start
including such questions. Very few did, although a few did late in the
general election. Nonetheless, by January 20, 2016, Breitbart News was
firing back at MacWilliams, as well as at Politico for publishing the
work of "a college graduate student." Breitbart writer/editor Mike Flynn
(a former Coca Cola bottling plant manager turned radio talk show host
turned Breitbart editor, who died six months later of a heart attack
after posting several nasty columns on the Clintons) found the
MacWilliams material wanting because it was based on research that began
following the rise of the Nazis in the late 1930s. Flynn, who had no
idea what he was talking about, nor did he make any effort to learn
about the seven decades of study of authoritarianism, simply dismissed
it. This is not unusual. Overwhelmingly, conservative Republicans who
test high as right-wing authoritarians are unhappy to be described by
this label, finding it pejorative. (A few academics who study
authoritarianism have tried in vain to come up with some other label,
and so far they have been less than successful.) But Matthew MacWilliams
not only impressed the Politico editors, a few others began looking
closely at what he was saying. Amanda Taub, who described herself at the
time as the "senior sadness correspondent, a former human rights lawyer,
now covering foreign policy, human rights, and Shetland ponies" at Vox,
was fascinated by the MacWilliams report. She started digging, and by
March 1, 2016, she published the best piece that would be written during
the 2016 presidential election cycle explaining the reason people were
drawn to Donald Trump. It was a 7,700-word dip into the well-tested and
vast social science that explained the secret source of the Trump
phenomenon. Her study and report were titled: "The rise of American
authoritarianism," with a subtitle punching up the significance of it
all: "A niche group of political scientists may have uncovered what's
driving Donald Trump's ascent. What they found has implications that go
well beyond 2016." Ms. **[Taub's piece was thoroughly researched and
nicely written, revealing]{.underline}** key information explaining
**[why Republicans were supporting "a far-right, orange-toned populist
with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often
bizarre views." Taub was not reporting the guesswork of pundits, rather
information based on political science and polling, with Vox even
running its own polls to confirm the findings that Trump
was]{.underline}**, in fact, **[the darling of]{.underline}** little
known American voters called **[authoritarians. Drawing
on]{.underline}** the work of Matthew MacWilliams, as well as on even
more **[established political scientists]{.underline}** like Marc
Hetherington of Vanderbilt, Jonathan Weiler of the University of North
Carolina, **[along with other scholars in related fields]{.underline}**
(e.g., professors Jonathan Haidt, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner and
Elizabeth Suhay), **[Taub's article provided a solidly documented
explanation of how Trump had become the candidate to beat in
2016]{.underline}**. (Amanda Taub is now with the New York Times.) It
should surprise no one that **[the authoritarians who elected Trump are
now his core supporters---his base. A steady stream of post-election
academic study confirms]{.underline}** the analysis that Amanda
**[Taub]{.underline}** assembled during the Trump campaign,
**[information which continues to be largely ignored by the mainstream
media]{.underline}**. Authoritarianism not only sounds pejorative, but
very wonky. The breakdown questions Ms. Taub suggested in March 2016,
remain equally if not more relevant given Trump is not only president,
but already planning is 2020 reelection bid: What is American
authoritarianism? Where did it come from? How does authoritarianism
work? What does authoritarianism explain? How did authoritarians end up
in the Republican Party? What does fear and loathing have to do with it?
How is authoritarianism changing America's political and social
landscape? What do authoritarians want? And how have authoritarians
changed American politics?

#### Trump's base will NEVER abandon him -- no matter what.

American History, \"The Trump Fever Never Breaks\" New York Times \--
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/opinion/sunday/the-trump-fever-never-breaks.html?mcubz=1\]

But **[when I hear people talk of Mr. Trump's supposedly dismal future,
I think of his not-so-dismal past]{.underline}**. I was the first
national television correspondent to cover Mr. Trump full-time, so **[I
know what can happen when people ignore the unbridled enthusiasm of his
crowds]{.underline}**. For more than 500 days, I watched as Mr. Trump's
campaign grew from an awkward rally around a backyard pool in June 2015
to a raucous, 10,000-person convention center event in November 2016. In
that same time, **[I]{.underline}** also **[watched as]{.underline}**
Mr. **[Trump's candidacy survived a procession of death
predictions.]{.underline}** Lately**[, it seems, those predictions are
back]{.underline}**. Last month, when asked whether the president will
be the Republican nominee in 2020, the Republican senator from Maine,
Susan Collins, told MSNBC, "It's too difficult to say." **[Every week
there's a new last straw: Comey, Charlottesville, Arpaio]{.underline}**.
If all else fails, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, will surely take
him down, right? When I was out on the road following Mr. Trump, I
sneaked in a bit of "Game of Thrones" on my laptop between rallies. What
I learned, to paraphrase the show, is that **[what is dead may never die
--- and, in Mr. Trump's case, may only rise stronger]{.underline}**. Mr.
**[Trump's candidacy was dead when he announced it.]{.underline}**
(Mexico is sending "rapists.") His candidacy was dead **[when he
insulted]{.underline}** a former prisoner of war named John
**[McCain]{.underline}**. ("I like people who weren't captured.") His
candidacy was dead when he cast suspicion on an entire religion.
("Donald J. Trump is calling for a complete and total shutdown of
Muslims entering the United States.") Dead **[when he attacked a federal
judge, a Gold Star family, the pope]{.underline}**. Deader than dead
when he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. ("When you're a
star, they let you do it.") The more Mr. Trump's candidacy was said to
flatline, the more life I saw in his crowds. In August 2015, a month
after a high-ranking Republican National Committee operative promised me
that America would never tolerate a man with no military service
disparaging an American military hero, I was standing on a football
field in Mobile, Ala., surrounded by 30,000 screaming Trump fans, an
unheard-of turnout six months before a primary. Were they mad about the
candidates words on Mr. McCain? No. The opposite. "He's not afraid of
anybody," one woman told me. Of all the times Donald Trump was done, it
is his current status as a supposedly lame duck first-term president
that reminds me most of his final months on the trail. Back then,
luminaries in his own party were condemning him, calling on him to drop
out and researching a late-race change to the top of the ticket. Much of
the country was outraged. The polls were bleak. No politician had ever
come back from what Mr. Trump was facing. But then, as now, the view
from armchairs in Washington and newsrooms around the country missed
something that it was impossible to miss out on the trail. Mr.
**[Trump's supporters were tired --- of Washington, of the media, of
waiting. And that fatigue allowed them to overlook a lot. They knew he
was flawed but at least, they thought, he was on their
side.]{.underline}** On one of Mr. Trump's primary victory nights, in a
ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by people in diamonds and silk, I
couldn't help wondering what Mr. Trump's rally crowds would think of all
the money their candidate chose to celebrate with. "Why do people
fighting for a raise relate to all of this?" I asked a man in a tuxedo.
"Because deep down, they know he's one of them," he said. "Trump sees
us," his supporters would tell me, everywhere we stopped. "You don't."
When they couldn't exactly cheer for him, they found ways to excuse him.
Five days after the "Access Hollywood" tape, for example, I asked an
older woman in a flowery red dress what she thought of her candidate's
theory of sexual license --- as a lone protester was playing the tape on
a loop outside a rally venue in Lakeland, Fla. She smiled. "What person
hasn't said it?" she said. "I haven't said it," I said. "Well, good for
you," she said. "You've said you're going to grab women by the ... ?" I
asked. "No. Don't be stupid," she said, and walked away. Shortly after,
Mr. Trump was onstage, kissing a pink Women for Trump sign, really
pressing his face against it. The crowd roared because they thought it
was funny and because it was a clear rebuke to anyone offended by what
Mr. Trump waved away as "locker room talk." **[Sometimes]{.underline}**
Mr. **[Trump's supporters had to justify or ignore his
positions]{.underline}**, too. **[Sure, they liked a lot of his policies
and ideas, but they weren't married to any of them. They wanted the man
above all. And if he said it, they'd find a way to support it, even if
he reversed himself the next day.]{.underline}** I once asked a man
heading into a rally why he supported Donald Trump. "Because he is going
to build a wall," the man said. "What if he doesn't?" I countered. "I
trust his judgment," the man said. They trusted his judgment and on
Election Day they trusted Mr. Trump more than they trusted any of us.
That's why when members of the media pronounced his candidacy dead, his
supporters knew the opposite was true. It was never more alive. **[Maybe
that has changed. I don't know. Nobody does]{.underline}**. **[The
building blocks of political life are too complex to predict, too
unstable to rely on. But I do know what political devotion looks like,
and I do know what happens when you choose to discount
it.]{.underline}**

#### Base support [resilient]{.underline}

\--voter perceptions are [steady]{.underline} despite scandals

\--eighty percent [approve]{.underline} of the job Trump's doing

\--adherence to a [populist agenda]{.underline}

**Shepard 17** -- Steven Shepard, Editor for The POLITICO Caucus and
chief polling analyst for POLITICO, What will it take for GOP voters to
cut Trump loose?, 05/17/2017,
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/donald-trump-polling-support-238519

Donald **[Trump's]{.underline}** overall **[approval
ratings]{.underline}** **[have cratered]{.underline}** **[to the lowest
point in his nascent presidency,]{.underline}** **[according to a new
POLITICO/Morning Consult survey and the RealClearPolitics and HuffPost
Pollster polling averages]{.underline}**. **[Yet among the Republican
base]{.underline}**, **[the president's standing remains strong in the
face of a mounting series of scandals]{.underline}**. His seeming
defiance of the laws of political gravity is so astounding that it has
official Washington wondering, what exactly will it take for GOP voters
to cut him loose?

It's not an easy question to answer. Despite a seemingly never-ending
series of gaffes, missteps and scandals that would have derailed other
politicians, **[voters' perceptions of Trump have been remarkably steady
since he launched his presidential campaign nearly two years
ago]{.underline}**, pollsters say.

**[Some things have moved the needle]{.underline}** --- **[like last
year's "Access Hollywood" tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting
women, or the initial failure in March to advance the GOP health care
bill through the House.]{.underline}** **[But Trump rebounded within
weeks of each event]{.underline}**, **[suggesting his support is
unusually, and exceptionally, durable.]{.underline}**

"It seems like he is trading in a very narrow band, at 38 \[percent\] on
the low end and 44 \[percent\] or 45 \[percent\] on the high end," said
Patrick Ruffini, co-founder of the GOP tech firm Echelon Insights.

In the case of this week's news --- reports that Trump disclosed highly
classified information to Russian government officials last week, and
that former FBI Director James Comey outlined in a contemporaneous
memorandum Trump's request to "let ... go" of an investigation into
former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn --- it's too early to
evaluate the impact. Even the latest Gallup daily tracking poll still
includes some interviews conducted before both stories were first
reported.

But there are some clues that suggest the scandals are indeed taking a
toll, even if it isn't immediately obvious from Trump's top-line
approval ratings. In terms of the level of enthusiasm for the president
--- often an indicator of grassroots passion for or against a president
\-- his numbers are underwater. According to this week's
POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, twice as many voters "strongly
disapprove" of Trump (38 percent) than "strongly approve" (19 percent).

Even there, pollsters note, the Republicans who have moved from
"strongly approve" to "somewhat approve" haven't abandoned the president
yet. Ruffini compared it to the presidential campaign, when Trump's
ballot share would slide after gaffes and scandals. But those voters
were parking in the "undecided" column, not with Hillary Clinton --- and
eventually came back to Trump when the controversies abated.

"**[The base is still with him]{.underline}**. **[Even on a bad week, 80
percent of Republicans approve of the job he is doing]{.underline}**,"
said Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who worked for Trump during
the campaign. "**[Because he's adhered in principle to a conservative,
populist agenda, they're still with him]{.underline}**. It's a matter of
winning back the center."

a huge deal? Could you have ridden it out instead of resigning? TR: I
don't know. Could I have pulled a Donald Trump, like a middle finger in

happened in the national level with **[the ridiculousness of people
upset with]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump saying a bad word on a bus
with Billy Bush --- those national news stories, they came and went very
quickly]{.underline}**. I don't think that necessarily happens on the
local level as much. I broke a lot of hearts at home and it's hard to
get past that. I should have resigned right away, there's no question
about that. But in retrospect, me hanging on desperately was just. . .
It was pathetic.

#### Policy issues are [irrelevant]{.underline} 

**McGrath 17 --** David McGrath, Emeritus English Professor at College
of DuPage, "What Trump Shares With Reagan, The Teflon President",
Chicago Tribune, 2017,
http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/opinion/ct-sta-mcgrath-column-st-0323-20170322-story.html

I never thought I would be comparing our 45th president to the
country\'s 40th. But Donald **[Trump does share something important
with]{.underline}** Ronald **[Reagan]{.underline}**.
**[People]{.underline}** my age **[remember Reagan as the Teflon
president]{.underline}**. The reason was that **[his personal charm and
glibness enabled him to fend off mistakes and criticism, so much so that
few of the barbs]{.underline}** or accusations **[against him seemed to
\"stick,\" just as nothing sticks to the bottom of a Teflon frying
pan]{.underline}**. In just one example, when the nation was struggling
with a poor economy in the early eighties, ABC journalist Sam Donaldson
thought he had him on the hot seat: \"Mr. President, in talking about
the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes in the past.
You have blamed the Congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?\"
\"Yes,\" Reagan answered, \"because for many years I was a Democrat!\"
**[Similarly, as we have seen with Trump, neither his falsehoods,
scandals, flip-flops, nor policy about-faces seem to have much of an
effect on his own popularity, at least with his base]{.underline}**.
**[Throughout his election campaign, when over 80% of Trump\'s
statements were labeled false by Politi-fact, it didn\'t matter to
supporters who continued to stand by him]{.underline}**. **[Even the
infamous three minute recording of Trump boasting about how his stardom
gave him license to grab women\'s private parts did not stick
detrimentally, as he went on to win the election after the type of
scandal that would have caused any other candidate to drop not only out
of the race, but off the face of the earth]{.underline}**. Just ask Gary
Hart. So, how has Trump managed to emerge from all the mud in his
ascension to the presidency? Unlike Reagan, he has not succeeded because
of his wit. He is not articulate, nor quick on his feet. Who could
forget his cringe-worthy rebuttal when Hillary Clinton suggested in a
debate that he was Vladimir Putin\'s puppet: \"No, you\'re the puppet.\"
And his generalizations (\"\...we\'re going to grow the economy so
much.\") and vitriol toward the media, are the antithesis of the style
of Reagan, a.k.a. The Great Communicator. But **[what won Trump the
presidency was a huge block of voters who chose him primarily because he
reminded them of themselves]{.underline}**. His winning strategy was to
echo the thoughts and feelings that he rightfully suspected were
simmering inside his constituents\' hearts: resentment against
government, immigrants, African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims,
academics, scientists and the media. Finally, a like-minded presidential
contender meant that their views were not just shameful manifestations
of racism or lack of education. Trump made them legit. A cartoon in a
recent edition of the New Yorker captured this phenomenon with a drawing
of a lone passenger standing up in the aisle of an airplane: \"These
smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us. Who thinks
I should fly the plane?\" In the drawing, all the passengers\' hands are
raised. So, too, with Trump supporters, for whom it doesn\'t matter that
he has never flown a jet. Doesn\'t matter if he decides to land
somewhere else. Doesn\'t even matter if he turns over the controls to
Mike Pence. Therefore, **[Trump breaking his promise to deport 11
million immigrants does not stick, because as chief validator of their
beliefs, he deserves loyalty, no matter what]{.underline}**. **[Trump
University being exposed as a con job? Doesn\'t stick. Bragging about
sexual triumphs and assault? Doesn\'t stick]{.underline}**. **[The most
recent step-back or lie that has taxpayers, and not Mexico, paying for
the border wall? Doesn\'t stick]{.underline}**. **[In fact, because
there are no negative consequences to what he said and did last year,
last week, or yesterday, as far as his followers are concerned, Trump is
proving to be more unaccountable than Reagan ever was]{.underline}**.

#### Base wont shift

**[Trump is winning]{.underline}**, at least **[among his
supporters]{.underline}**, his war with the media. **[They buy his
conspiracy theories]{.underline}** -- the story about wiretapping that
has since been shot down by Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers is the
perfect example -- **[as if they are gospel]{.underline}**. **[News that
does not paint him in a positive light is immediately determined to be
"fake]{.underline}**." **[Anytime he speaks he is conducting a
conversation with those who elected him]{.underline}**. There is no
attempt at unifying the country because that would prove his undoing.
And while his favorability numbers continue to dip, just about every
metric shows that the same people -- rich or poor, smart or stupid and
mostly white -- who put him in office still hang on his every lying
word. They are the people that put him in office, **[they support him
unwaveringly]{.underline}**, and if he isn't impeached, something no one
should count on, **[they will vote for him again.]{.underline}**

MAPLE PARK, Ill. --- Snow and sleet were falling on Eldon Gould's 500
acres this week, but he was already looking ahead to planting season;
depending on ground conditions and the temperature, that could be just
several weeks away. But now **[the prospect of steel and aluminum
tariffs]{.underline}** was **[add]{.underline}**ing **[to the list of
worries]{.underline}** and uncertainties that come with **[every corn
and soybean season]{.underline}**. "**[It's the retaliation

table in Maple Park, in a region of northern Illinois where farmland
runs on for miles. "**[The world's already awash in
grain]{.underline}**," Mr. Gould said, "and then **[if you lose a key
customer --- it's big. They're going to go somewhere else to buy
it]{.underline}**." **[That's a tangible threat throughout the Midwest,
which accounts for]{.underline}** roughly **[half the nation's
agricultural output, a prime target in any tit-for-tat response to the
tariffs announced by]{.underline}** President **[Trump. Unlike the rest
of the economy, farms deliver a trade surplus]{.underline}** for the
United States, **[and a trade war could put barriers around lucrative
markets]{.underline}**. Mr. Gould, 76, is a longtime Republican, and
like **[large numbers of farmers]{.underline}**, he **[voted
for]{.underline}** Mr. **[Trump. But several of the president's policy

For weeks now, I have been reading studies examining **[Trump's
base]{.underline}**, those **[core supporters who are with him
notwithstanding his conspicuous incompetence]{.underline}** as President
of the United States, **[and the resulting chaos his lack of leadership
has created]{.underline}**. Trump's base is not solely (although it
includes) those people who are reported in polls on his job approval,
for with the better polls these are randomly selected people. Rather
**[these are the people who are prepared to vote for him in 2020, and
vote in 2018 for congressional candidates who support
Trump]{.underline}** and his administration's policies. **[The
core]{.underline}** supporters of Trump's presidency **[are the people
who were attracted to Trump from Republican primaries]{.underline}**,
those **[who wanted him to take down established
candidates]{.underline}**. It takes very little digging to find that
these **[voters liked his political incorrectness]{.underline}**, and
**[many]{.underline}** had **[first noticed him when he began
attacking]{.underline}** President **[Obama as]{.underline}** an
**[illegitimate]{.underline}** president: Trump's conspiracy theory
about Obama being born in Kenya, thus not a "natural born" citizen of
the United States, who could become president. It is easy to forget that
the eight years of the Obama presidency (2009--2017) was a very
difficult time for many white Americans, and these years witnessed a
significant political realignment in the United States. The racial
schisms that Nixon, Reagan, and the Bushes played on with their southern
strategies, which reshaped the Republican Party in the South and rural
areas, became a racial divide during Obama's years in the White House.
Americans became totally polarized. These changes commenced in the
immediate aftermath of Barack Obama's election. For example, Kaylon
Johnson experienced them first-hand. He had been an Obama volunteer and
was still smiling and wearing an Obama t-shirt just days after Obama's
win, when he stopped at his regular Shreveport, Louisiana, gas station
in his GMC Yukon utility vehicle, which displayed an Obama bumper
sticker. After purchasing gas and a soft drink, Kaylon was attacked by
three white men shouting obscenities at him, including "Fuck Obama" and
"No \[n-word\] President." They pummeled Johnson, sending him to the
emergency room with a broken nose and fractured eye socket that required
surgery. There were countless such incidents, along with cross-burnings,
and not only in the South but throughout the country. At the University
of Kentucky, a life-sized likeness of Obama was hanged from a noose in a
tree. Racist graffiti was spray-painted from Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, to Springfield, Massachusetts, to Tacoma, Washington. Southern
school children chanted: "Assassinate Obama/Assassinate
Obama/Assassinate Obama." The Secret Service arrested a Wisconsin man
who announced his plans online to kill Obama, and Neo-Nazi radio host
Hal Turner shared his dream of an unmanned drone or chemical-filled
balloons killing Obama and all those attending his forthcoming
inauguration. Obama's election and presidency provoked ugly racist
reactions by a startling number of conservative Republicans, both
leaders and followers. Openly racist conservatives, men and women,
shamelessly viewed the Obama White House as a call to arms and actions.
Like a cancer escaping remission, racism reemerged in America with a
vengeance, with its practitioners, promoters and organizers using the
internet to invigorate once largely dormant organizations like Ku Klux
Klan and the Council of Conservative Citizens, and to create new groups,
including online gatherings like the Confederate Pride website,
attracting men and women who rejected mainstream American conservatism
to embrace white nationalism and white supremacy, antifeminism,
homophobia, nativism, anti-immigration and Islamophobia. In addition,
here was a resurgence of neo-Nazi groups that embraced white supremacy
and xenophobia along with anti-Semitism. These groups were soon referred
to as "the alternative right," as early as 2008, later morphing into the
label "Alt Right." Local, state and national politicians in the South
were often ahead of their constituents in reacting to Obama's election
in plotting and planning how to defeat if not end his presidency. As
President Obama and wife Michelle danced at his inauguration ball,
fifteen of the most powerful members of the Republican Party, top GOP
lawmakers and strategists, gathered at the Caucus Room Restaurant in
Washington for a private dinner to consider ways to subvert Obama's
presidency. Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced that his agenda
was to make certain Obama was a one-term president who accomplished
little. Less than a month after Obama's inauguration, on February 19,
2009, CNBC reporter Rick Santelli gave an on-camera rant from the floor
of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange opposing President Obama's stimulus
package to deal with a tanking economy, and along his way calling for a
"tea party" in Lake Michigan. News reporters played and replayed the
rant, which caught the attention of some conservative activists, who by
conference call agreed to start protesting Obama's agenda. Unknowingly,
Santelli and the news media had ignited a movement. The Tea Party was
born. Soon, nationwide demonstrations erupted, largely spontaneously,
and organizers kept them going. (See, e.g., Scott Rasmussen and Doug
Schoen, Mad As Hell: How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally
Remaking Our Two-Party System (New York: Harper Collins Publishers,
2020); Theda Skocpol and Venessa Williamson, The Tea Party and the
Remaking of Republican Conservatism (New York: Oxford University Press,
2012); Nella Van Dyke and David S. Meyer (eds.), Understanding the Tea
Party Movement (New York: Routledge, 2016).) The discomfort of the Alt
Right and Tea Party with an African American in the White House was not
lost on Donald Trump, and in early 2011 he reached out to a leading
right-wing conspiracy theorist who claimed Obama was not a natural-born
American, rather from Kenya. Trump quickly became "birtherism's" most
outspoken champion. And the racism of the Alt Right, Tea Party, and
other conservatives discovered Trump. This race-based support would take
him all the way to the White House, and it remains the foundation of his
support. (Of course, he cannot appear openly racist, so he has a few
token African Americans in his otherwise lily-white administration,
e.g., Omarosa Manigault, for a while, and Ben Carson, for a while
longer.) There are **[other factors]{.underline}**, of course, that
**[solidified and united the people who elected Trump, and retain them
as his core supporters. These include]{.underline}** the development of
**[social media]{.underline}** on the internet (Trump without Twitter
would be unable to communicate with these people), **[and]{.underline}**
the growing availability of **[dark and hidden money in the presidential
election process]{.underline}** following the landmark ruling of the US
Supreme Court in Citizens United vs. FEC, decided on January 21, 2010.
This split decision by the High Court changed the political landscape.
Without Citizens United, Donald Trump would not be president because
this new money not only funded his campaign, but it enabled disparate
groups of like-thinking people to operate as a unified force. **[While
the news media at least took notice of the]{.underline}** people who
were organizing to support Trump during his campaign---most of whom have
remained among his **[core supporters]{.underline}**---**[the reason
these people support Trump has been widely misunderstood if not totally
ignored]{.underline}**, although not by everyone. For example, on
January 17, 2016, as Trump's campaign was weathering storm after storm,
looking like it might sink, Politico published a brief article by
Matthew **[MacWilliams]{.underline}**, founder of a small upstart
political communications firm and a political science PhD candidate at
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. **[MacWilliams noticed that
the work on his dissertation appeared to be playing out in the Trump
campaign]{.underline}**. Speaking with his academic voice, **[he wrote:
"I've found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether
a voter supports Trump]{.underline}**---and it's not race, income or
education levels: **[It's authoritarianism]{.underline}**." His finding
was based on a national poll sponsored by University of Massachusetts,
asking questions about authoritarianism that other pollsters were
ignoring. Based on his findings, he urged other pollsters to start
including such questions. Very few did, although a few did late in the
general election. Nonetheless, by January 20, 2016, Breitbart News was
firing back at MacWilliams, as well as at Politico for publishing the
work of "a college graduate student." Breitbart writer/editor Mike Flynn
(a former Coca Cola bottling plant manager turned radio talk show host
turned Breitbart editor, who died six months later of a heart attack
after posting several nasty columns on the Clintons) found the
MacWilliams material wanting because it was based on research that began
following the rise of the Nazis in the late 1930s. Flynn, who had no
idea what he was talking about, nor did he make any effort to learn
about the seven decades of study of authoritarianism, simply dismissed
it. This is not unusual. Overwhelmingly, conservative Republicans who
test high as right-wing authoritarians are unhappy to be described by
this label, finding it pejorative. (A few academics who study
authoritarianism have tried in vain to come up with some other label,
and so far they have been less than successful.) But Matthew MacWilliams
not only impressed the Politico editors, a few others began looking
closely at what he was saying. Amanda Taub, who described herself at the
time as the "senior sadness correspondent, a former human rights lawyer,
now covering foreign policy, human rights, and Shetland ponies" at Vox,
was fascinated by the MacWilliams report. She started digging, and by
March 1, 2016, she published the best piece that would be written during
the 2016 presidential election cycle explaining the reason people were
drawn to Donald Trump. It was a 7,700-word dip into the well-tested and
vast social science that explained the secret source of the Trump
phenomenon. Her study and report were titled: "The rise of American
authoritarianism," with a subtitle punching up the significance of it
all: "A niche group of political scientists may have uncovered what's
driving Donald Trump's ascent. What they found has implications that go
well beyond 2016." Ms. **[Taub's piece was thoroughly researched and
nicely written, revealing]{.underline}** key information explaining
**[why Republicans were supporting "a far-right, orange-toned populist
with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often
bizarre views." Taub was not reporting the guesswork of pundits, rather
information based on political science and polling, with Vox even
running its own polls to confirm the findings that Trump
was]{.underline}**, in fact, **[the darling of]{.underline}** little
known American voters called **[authoritarians. Drawing
on]{.underline}** the work of Matthew MacWilliams, as well as on even
more **[established political scientists]{.underline}** like Marc
Hetherington of Vanderbilt, Jonathan Weiler of the University of North
Carolina, **[along with other scholars in related fields]{.underline}**
(e.g., professors Jonathan Haidt, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner and
Elizabeth Suhay), **[Taub's article provided a solidly documented
explanation of how Trump had become the candidate to beat in
2016]{.underline}**. (Amanda Taub is now with the New York Times.) It
should surprise no one that **[the authoritarians who elected Trump are
now his core supporters---his base. A steady stream of post-election
academic study confirms]{.underline}** the analysis that Amanda
**[Taub]{.underline}** assembled during the Trump campaign,
**[information which continues to be largely ignored by the mainstream
media]{.underline}**. Authoritarianism not only sounds pejorative, but
very wonky. The breakdown questions Ms. Taub suggested in March 2016,
remain equally if not more relevant given Trump is not only president,
but already planning is 2020 reelection bid: What is American
authoritarianism? Where did it come from? How does authoritarianism
work? What does authoritarianism explain? How did authoritarians end up
in the Republican Party? What does fear and loathing have to do with it?
How is authoritarianism changing America's political and social
landscape? What do authoritarians want? And how have authoritarians
changed American politics?

as voters say 65-27 percent that the Trump administration does not do a
good job handling issues that have a significant impact on women. Men
say no 59-32 percent and women say no 71-22 percent. **[Voters

by several people should not receive a security clearance, voters say
73-17 percent. Voters say 57-40 percent they do not like Trump\'s
policies and say 61-30 percent they do not like him as a person.
American voters say 56-36 percent that Trump acts more like an autocrat
than a typical American president. **[When it comes to Russia, voters
are capable of overlooking his antics]{.underline}**, the poll found.
\"American voters think 76-18 percent, including 55-35 percent among

extent the GOP-led House of Representatives has stuck with him, one
would think it could leave Republicans open to the serious attack that
they have failed to respond to the Russian threat. Looking more closely
at the data, one is struck by several phenomena. First, **[young voters
really, really don\'t like Trump]{.underline}**. Seventy percent of
voters under the age of 35 said they don\'t approve of his performance
--- 60 percent of which said they strongly disapprove. Nearly 80 percent
of younger voters dislike the Republican Congress. Second, **[Trump\'s
support among white voters without college degrees has eroded. They
approve]{.underline}** of the job he is doing **[by only a
slim]{.underline}** 47- to 45-percent **[plurality. They certainly
don\'t like the president as a person]{.underline}** (39 percent like/50
percent dislike), **[and a majority]{.underline}** (59 percent) of these
voters **[want him to release his tax returns, 44 percent]{.underline}**
of which **[believe he hasn\'t done so because he has something to

women, think the White House mishandled]{.underline}** the Rob
**[Porter]{.underline}** situation, **[and think that Russia interfered
with]{.underline}** the **[2016]{.underline}** election. A large
plurality (46 percent) said he has mishandled the Russia scandal, and 50
percent believe he acts more like an autocrat than he does a typical

### Thumper

#### Trump is a historically unreliable ally for the NRA which is weak now

**Coaston 1/17** (Jane, senior politics reporter at Vox, 2019, "Why the
NRA is struggling",
<https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/17/18167430/nra-2018-midterms-trump-spending-trouble>,
Aly M)

**[Though the NRA has remained one of the president's greatest
champions, Trump himself became a curious liability for the
organization.\
After the Parkland school shooting in the spring of 2018, Trump argued
at a meeting with lawmakers that the minimum age for rifle purchases
should be raised and that law enforcement should be able to seize guns
without a court order, saying, "Take the guns first, go through due
process second." In another meeting, this time with a gathering of state
governors, Trump said, "Half of you are so afraid of the NRA. There's
nothing to be afraid of. \... And you know what, if they're not with
you, we have to fight them every once in a while, that's okay."\
This is perhaps unsurprising from a president who grew up in New York
City and once advocated heavily for gun control before he aligned
himself with the Republican Party. In Trump's 2000 book, The America We
Deserve, Trump decried members of the GOP who "walk the NRA line" and
resisted restrictions on guns.\
Whether because of Trump or not, the NRA itself is taking a hit, perhaps
because with the GOP in charge of the White House, donating to an
organization purportedly standing up for gun rights seems less
essential.\
The NRA's revenue from membership dues --- a one-year membership costs
\$45 --- has dropped 21 percent since 2016, from \$163 million to \$128
million, according to the nonpartisan transparency organization
OpenSecrets. Other donations to the NRA dropped too, from \$128 million
in 2016 to \$98 million in 2017. That revenue drop has led to
cost-cutting measures across the organization, from raising the cost of
dues to dropping free coffee and water at its Fairfax, Virginia,
headquarters to major layoffs at the group's media outlet, NRATV.\
But most importantly, the revenue drop dramatically impacted how
involved the NRA got in the 2018 midterm elections. The group got
involved in about half the races in 2018 that it did during the previous
midterm cycle, and the amount it spent dropped as well --- from \$25
million in 2014 to less than half that this cycle.]{.underline}**\
One source told me that the election spending was a canary in a coal
mine for the organization. **["They spent very little money compared to
what they usually do. And that's a problem for them. And they need to
figure out why that is, and what's going on, and how they can fix it if
they want to remain as prominent and influential as they
are."]{.underline}**

### Arms Sales Not Key

#### NRA in disarray -- gun lobby needs Trump more than he needs them -- he can get away with reducing arms sales

**Richardson 4/29** (Davis, policy reporter for the Observer, 2019,
"Donald Trump's Relationship Status With the NRA? It's Complicated",
<https://observer.com/2019/04/trump-nra-complicated-relationship/>, Aly
M)

**[Just one day after President Donald Trump addressed the National
Rifle Association (NRA) leadership conference last week, the infamous
gun lobbying organization imploded. Over the weekend, the NRA's recently
installed president Oliver North was ousted, its longtime lawyer Steve
Hart was suspended and the New York State Attorney General's office
announced it had launched an investigation into the group's nonprofit
status.\]{.underline}**
Almost on cue, the president on Monday tweeted support, and a veiled
warning, for the organization.\
**[Support from the president will prove paramount as the NRA navigates
mounting legal hurdles, financial woes (the group hemorrhaged \$46
million in 2016) and an ongoing civil war. Although the NRA spent
roughly \$30 million to help Trump's 2016 campaign, the president has
publicly challenged the organization many times while in office.\
Following the Parkland shooting last February, the president accused a
GOP lawmaker of being "afraid of the NRA" for not supporting a federal
age limit for purchasing firearms.\
"Somebody can buy a handgun at 21," said the president. "Now this is not
a popular thing to say in terms of the NRA, but I'm saying it anyway."\
Most recently, the Trump administration rolled out federal regulation in
December banning bump fire stocks---the same device a shooter used to
alter a semi-automatic rifle and massacre 59 people in Las Vegas in
2017. The NRA was largely silent on the issue, but did say it was
"disappointed" by the measure.\
Vexed with a new state investigation, the gun lobbying juggernaut
desperately needs support from Trump, giving him even more influence to
pull the gun lobbyists in whatever direction he wants.]{.underline}**

### No Link -- Media Spin

#### Media spin means Trump controls the narrative to his base- no risk of backlash

Leandra **Bernstein 2017** (Sinclair Broadcast Group, "Poll: Mainstream
media continues to lose the public\'s trust"
<http://valleycentral.com/news/nation-world/main-stream-media-continue-to-lose-the-publics-trust>
Feb 14th )

WASHINGTON (Sinclair Broadcast Group) \-- While many mainstream media
outlets have cried foul over Donald Trump targeting outlets as
\"failing\" or peddling \"fake news,\" that sentiment is largely shared
by a majority of Americans. In its annual confidence poll, **[Gallup
found that Americans\' trust in the mass media]{.underline}** \"to
report the news fully, accurately and fairly\" **[reached its lowest
level in polling history]{.underline}**, with only 32 percent saying
they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. Trust in
the establishment media did not begin with the contentious 2016 election
and Donald Trump taking the stage, but after a steady decline over the
past 20 years, it took its deepest dive yet, led by Republicans deep
distrust of mass media. **[On the campaign trail, Trump maintained a
combative relationship with the press, but received roaring applause
from his supporters when he referred to the \"dishonest media,\" and
sniped at the]{.underline}** anchors, pundits,
**[reporters]{.underline}** and editorial boards who **[he said were
treating him \"very unfairly.\"]{.underline}** **[In order to skirt the
criticism and the tough questions, Trump took advantage of Twitter, the
most effective tools he has used to circumvent the media and communicate
directly with his base.]{.underline}** In one of his first stops after
taking office, Trump addressed intelligence professionals at CIA
headquarters, using the occasion to address his \"running war with the
media.\" He received laughter and applause when referring to the press
as \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth.\" Only a week
earlier, Trump shut out CNN\'s Jim Acosta to the delight of his
supporters, denying a question to the mainstay of cable news during his
first press conference after winning the election. Today, after less
than a month in the White House, **[Trump continues to transform the
relationship with the mainstream media]{.underline}**. Reporters who
were traditionally the first to be called on by previous press
secretaries have been edged out by Sean Spicer. In place of the
Associated Press, CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times,
Spicer has brought in outside voices. In his first briefings, Spicer
called on the New York Post, Breitbart, LifeZette, One America News
Network, and Newsmax. Rather than staying in the traditional press
secretary\'s comfort zone of the first two rows of the briefing room,
Spicer has introduced local news outlets from across the country
questioning the White House via Skype. \"The point is, there are voices
and issues that the mainstream media sometimes doesn\'t capture, and its
important for those issues to get as much prominence as some of the
mainstream ones,\" Spicer told Fox News in January. Bringing in more
non-traditional media outlets is by design Spicer explained. \"Over and
over again we are seeing people gravitate towards sites because they
recognize the mainstream media isn\'t the only game in town,\" he said.
While some larger media outlets have complained that **[the new White
House briefing format is crowding out]{.underline}** the more hard-nosed
**[critical reporters with Trump cronies]{.underline}**, Spicer has also
brought in a handful of local media outlets, who enjoy one advantage
over the national establishment media: more trust. According to a 2016
Pew Research study, 22 percent of respondents had \"a lot\" of trust in
local news organizations, compared to 18 percent who trust national
outlets. In total, local news coverage enjoyed a six-point advantage
over national stations. The shake-up of the national media giants in
favor of local stations or new media outlets has raised the ire of those
who previously enjoyed having their questions at the front of the queue.
During the Monday joint press briefing with Donald Trump and Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Sinclair Broadcasting Group\'s reporter,
Scott Thuman was called on to ask the first question. Thuman asked the
two North American leaders whether either had decided to \"alter or
amend\" their very different approaches to immigration, terrorism, and
trade. Trump also took a question from the Daily Caller. CNN reported
that other reporters were \"outraged\" that they weren\'t called on and
that neither Sinclair or Daily Caller asked about the fate of National
Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, who announced his resignation from the
administration just hours after the press conference. The Washington
Post and New York Times both alleged that Trump had intentionally called
on \"friendly\" media outlets to avoid harsh questioning. Fox News and
AP directly confronted the two reporters who got their questions
answered, alleging their questions had been planted by the White House.
Sinclair Broadcast Group\'s Vice President of News, Scott Livingston
defended the reporter for working \"to go beyond inside the beltway
chatter and get to the heart of the issues that are relevant to all
Americans \... The question wasn't pre-set, screened nor suggested by
the White House. We stand by Scott's judgement and reporting.\" That
wasn\'t the end of the media infighting on Monday, as the New York Times
led a pack of news outlets taking aim at the Wall Street Journal, whose
editor-in-chief Gerard Baker insisted on keeping coverage of Trump
objective. One individual attending the Monday town-hall style meeting
described **[the]{.underline}** Journal\'s **[lack of criticism of the
president as \"neutral to the point of being absurd.\"]{.underline}**
Baker defending the publication\'s stance in a statement after the
meeting saying, \"If you view a Trump presidency as something that's
potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You
would move closer than you've ever been to being oppositional. That's
uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, non-opinion
journalist I've ever known, and by normal standards, untenable.\"
**[Last week Emerson College]{.underline}** political communications
professor Spencer Kimball **[published a poll comparing the public\'s
trust in main stream media to the public\'s trust in Donald
Trump.]{.underline}** The poll was shared the next day by President
Trump himself under the headline, \"Trump administration seen as more
truthful than news media.\" **[The poll found that 49 percent of voters
consider Trump to be truthful]{.underline}**, versus 48 person of voters
who find him untruthful. The **[researchers then compared that
confidence rating to trust in the news media, which 53 percent of voters
considered to be untruthful, a 14-point gap. A key finding of the poll
shows that voters find the Trump administration to be more truthful than
the news media.]{.underline}** The partisan split was obvious, with the
overwhelming majority of Republicans saying Trump is truthful and 88
percent considering the media untruthful. Democrats overwhelmingly found
Trump untruthful and 62 percent found the media to be truthful. Tens of
thousands of people saw the poll when it was tweeted out by the
president, leading to an outpouring of responses for Spencer Kimball.
\"It was very intense,\" Kimball said of the response. \"I would say the
negative comments were three to one, at least in emails I received or
phone calls I received from people who were upset about the poll
results.\" **[Trump\'s approval ratings are hovering around 49
percent]{.underline}**, according to the Real Clear Politics average.
While that\'s certainly nothing to brag about in the so-called honeymoon
period after the election, **[it matches up pretty well with the Emerson
poll on the president\'s truthfulness]{.underline}**. Kimball defended
his work and had to explain to critics \"This is how people are really
thinking. It\'s not ten percent of the country that trusts Trump, maybe
it\'s 45 percent and not 49 percent, but it\'s right up there.\" **[What
is most concerning]{.underline}**, though was less the reaction to the
particular poll, but **[a growing tendency by media consumers to only
read or watch those things that confirm their preexisting biases or
ideologies.]{.underline}** \"It\'s scary,\" Kimball said. \"**[If you
report something and people don\'t like it they will refer to it as
\'fake news.\'\"]{.underline}** The back and forth accusations over fake
news come from both the left and the right, from Democrats and from
President Trump who has routinely denounced unfavorable polls or
critical coverage as fake news. The tendency for media consumers across
the ideological spectrum to engage in selective exposure and
confirmation bias is a worrying trend. \"Both sides are using this as a
way to dismiss credible information,\" Kimball warned. **[With more than
60 percent of American adults getting their news from social media, and
about half getting their news from only one source, it is easier than
every to personalize both the sources of information and the facts
themselves.]{.underline}** \"We\'re in a very politicized environment
and we are now in a situation where a lot of people try to get the news
from a politically congenial echo chamber,\" said Cathy Young,
contributing editor at Reason magazine.

### No Diversionary War

#### No diversionary war

Founding Editor of the Russian business daily Vedomosti and Founded
Slon.ru, "Trump\'s Forever War of Diversion", Bloomberg News, 1-25,
https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-25/trump-s-forever-war-of-diversion

**[There\'s even a term for the tactic: \"diversionary
conflict.\"]{.underline}** Faced with economic difficulties or other
problems potentially threatening to its survival, the regime starts a
war somewhere or sharpens domestic ethnic divisions. Since the oil price
plummeted in late 2014, the Putin regime has kept Russians on a steady
diet of war news from eastern Ukraine and Syria (Russia and its allies
have been winning). With the Syrian operation, Putin sharply raised his
international standing, but a big reduction in protests against
worsening economic conditions has probably been more important to him.
In neighboring Ukraine, every time a government finds itself in trouble
and particularly unpopular, the matter of the country\'s linguistic
division surfaces, with various groups trying to promote or ban the
Russian language. Former President Viktor Yanukovych used the language
matter as cover for passing other unpopular legislation. Now, with
president Petro Poroshenko\'s popularity at a nadir, reforms stalled and
the cost of living rising sharply, Ukrainians are distracted by the
discussion of a new language law that would make Ukrainian obligatory in
public life, under threat of fines. **[Trump doesn\'t need to start
wars: He and his team know how emotional many Americans are about him.
He can choose what he wants to be hated for \-- preferably for something
silly and unrelated to his actual priorities at the moment. He used this
to his advantage during the campaign: His alleged sexual misconduct took
up so much media time and public attention than issues like his business
history, his tax returns and his proposals.]{.underline}** As the
inauguration attendance argument played, Trump has been busy. [**Apart
from starting the Obamacare rollback and withdrawing from the TPP, he
has frozen a reduction of mortgage insurance premiums, allowed the
Keystone Pipeline to go ahead and prepared to sign an executive order to
begin construction of a border wall. Well aware that some of these
important actions might cause indignation and targeted protest, Trump
has tossed out another meaningless football for the media and the public
to fixate on.**]{.underline} \"I will be asking for a major
investigation into **[VOTER FRAUD]{.underline}**, including those
registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even those
registered to vote who are dead,\" he tweeted. Sure enough, at the time
of this writing, [**the CNN story about this was the most shared in the
last 24 hours, with news about the border wall order coming a distant
second.**]{.underline} Just as it was unimportant how many people
attended the inauguration, it doesn\'t matter at all at this point
whether undocumented immigrants actually voted last November and whether
any votes were cast for dead people. No one is challenging the results
of the election. The wall and the Keystone Pipeline matter, yet are much
smaller stories in terms of readership. Trump and his team are already
showing a flair for diversion. Is it enough to discourage the kinds of
mass protests that such aggressive moves on lightning-rod issues might
spark? We\'ll know in the coming days and weeks, though protesters\'
energy was certainly sapped by the massive women\'s march, which took
place before Trump actually did anything damaging to women\'s rights.
**[Trump\'s and his team\'s communications]{.underline}** look awkward,
inept, gallingly primitive. It\'s time to wise up: These people know
what they\'re doing. They want their political opponents to be confused,
to flail at windmills, to **[expend emotions on meaningless scandals
to]{.underline}** **[distract them from any targeted, coordinated action
against specific threats]{.underline}**. There are going to be many of
these: Trump appears intent on keeping his promises. Calm concentration
is needed to counteract dangerous policies.

**[But what about military force? To be clear, there is little cause to
speculate that Trump plans to launch a full-scale war solely to distract
attention]{.underline}**. For one thing, **[as president, the worst
possible time to start a major military campaign is when you're deeply
unpopular.]{.underline}** And **[the political upside is shaky at best.
Recent big wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were politically damaging to
George W. Bush. Even victory doesn't guarantee a pay-off, as George H.

#### Congress and Trump's advisors will create fake victories to make him feel like he's taken diversionary action\-\--no actual impact.

Dog\' for the Age of Trump" Bloomberg \-- December 13 \--

Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** come into office
knowing little about government policies and probably caring less about
most of them. But he\'s going to **[want to stage an impressive opening
number or two]{.underline}**, **[to let everyone know who\'s the star of
this show]{.underline}**. The combination of uninformed and
uninterested, but still ambitious and aggressive \-- does that sound
like potential trouble? If so, here\'s a different question. **[How can
we insure that the new president feels he\'s getting his way often
enough to keep him satisfied without creating disaster]{.underline}** on
the actual policies? Answer: Think \"Wag the Dog.\" In this version,
**[people inside]{.underline}** and outside of hi**[s administration
will persuade him to fight and win a few harmless
battles]{.underline}**. **[The Tweeter-in-Chief can say]{.underline}**
and believe **[he\'s taking decisive action]{.underline}**. And normal
Republicans and Democrats can get on with hashing out the normal stuff
of politics. Suggestion One: The president wins the war on crime!
Solution: As president-elect, Trump is still saying the murder rate is
\"highest in 45 years,\" a fictional claim he made in the campaign as
well. Despite a jump in 2015, the murder rate is close to historical
lows. So all he has to do is start using real statistics instead of
phony ones to claim credit for solving this one. The formula can be
repeated for other mistaken claims he made during the campaign about how
terrible America is. Suggestion Two: Repeal a fictional law! Solution:
The president can help fulfill his \"drain the swamp\" pledge if he can
claim a full defeat for everyone in Congress, including the Republican
leadership. A harmless way to do this is to make up a law he can
persuade Congress to \"repeal.\" There\'s even a phony law that has
already been invented, the Public Affairs Act of 1975, a title dreamed
up by academics to study how public opinion works. It turns out that
many people will readily express opinions on non-existent laws, and will
support or oppose them in response to partisan cues. If congressional
leaders deny the need to repeal the (fictional) law, perhaps Trump can
get them to take action anyway, since it would placate the angry
constituents who are calling the legislators\' offices and demanding
that the \"law\" be declared null and void. Done. Trump can go on a
victory tour, and leave the battles over real policies to the people who
are serious about the policies. Many voters don\'t know how law-making
works in the U.S. in the first place, and others may not care much about
the truth so much as they care about visibly sticking it to the
do-nothing bureaucrats in Washington. Suggestion Three: Invade
something! **[The president-elect was the \"bomb the hell out of them\"
candidate]{.underline}**. H**[ow can he do this without involving a lot
of innocent people or harming the interests of the U.S.,]{.underline}**
let alone pick the wrong place (the South China Sea?) and risk global
war? Solution: **[Find someplace out of the way]{.underline}**, maybe an
uninhabited island somewhere in the South Pacific \-- closer to Hawaii
than to China and Japan. Announce that Islamic League is about to set up
a base there, **[and then bomb away]{.underline}** and even stage a
beach landing, with patriotic flag-raising pictures. Yes, I\'m joking
(well, mostly). But **[these \"solutions\" show some serious truths
about how government works. Congress, career civil servants, interest
groups and parties manipulate all presidents]{.underline}**. **[The only
question is how much]{.underline}**, and how successful presidents are
in fighting back. Even the most knowledgeable presidents have very
limited expertise, given the vast number of subjects they deal with \--
everything from space travel to Medicare reimbursement rates to aircraft
carriers to national parks to constitutional law to regulation of
complex financial products to disputes among Kurdish factions in Iraq.
And the civil servants and members of Congress and lobbyists that
presidents deal with are often masters of detail on whatever specific
issue is under consideration. Presidents win a lot of these fights (or
at least play to a draw) because they have strong political skills. They
are good at figuring out what others want, and at knowing the incentives
and motivations of those they must interact with.
**[Trump]{.underline}** has to date not demonstrated such skills,
although, to be fair, he\'s only beginning to be tested. Thus far, **[he
has shown a weakness for being easily distracted]{.underline}**, **[and
of seeking quick, surface-level results]{.underline}** \-- **[ones
that]{.underline}** career **[bureaucrats]{.underline}** or House
subcommittee chairs **[can reverse later]{.underline}**, once the
president\'s attention has moved on to something else.

Presidential Power Are Stronger Than You Think" 1-20-17
https://www.thecipherbrief.com/article/north-america/checks-presidential-power-are-stronger-you-think-1091)

TCB: Which are the most **[resilient]{.underline}** currently existing
**[checks on his power]{.underline}**, and which need to be bolstered?

JG: There **[are]{.underline}** many, both **[inside and outside the
Executive branch]{.underline}**. On the inside, **[a bevy of lawyers,
ethics monitors, inspectors general, and bureaucrats in the intelligence
and defense communities have expertise, interests and values, and
infighting skills that enable them to check and narrow]{.underline}**
the options for **[even the most aggressive presidents]{.underline}**.
**[On the outside, the press, which did]{.underline}** such **[an
extraordinary job of holding Bush, and]{.underline}** to a lesser extent
**[Obama, to account, is more motivated than ever to hold Trump
accountable.]{.underline}** The **[same goes for civil society
groups]{.underline}** like the ACLU, **[which have used lawsuits,
reports, and F]{.underline}**reedom of **[I]{.underline}**nformation
**[A]{.underline}**ct **[requests to expose government operations and
misdeeds since 9/11, and]{.underline}** whose coffers have **[ballooned
since Trump]{.underline}**'s election. Spurred on by the press and civil
society, the judiciary, which often stood up to Bush, will stand up even
more to Trump if he engages in excessive behavior. Finally, **[Congress
has been more consequential in constraining the national security
president since 9/11 than people realize]{.underline}**. And as we have
already seen in some pushback from Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey
Graham (R-SC), and Rand Paul (R-KY), it will stand up to Trump on many
issues, even though his party nominally controls Congress.

None of these institutions are perfect. They are especially ill-suited
to prevent the President from using military force as he sees fit, which
is why the Obama Administration's precedents in this context are so
troubling. But the **[institutions]{.underline}** **[do a much better
job in]{.underline}** other **[national security contexts than they
have]{.underline}** been given **[credit for, and they will be watching
president Trump with a very skeptical eye and an array of powers to push
back.]{.underline}**

### Twitter

#### Trump diverts through twitter and small missile strikes

**Tierney 17** (Dominic Tierney is a contributing editor at The Atlantic
and an associate professor of political science at Swarthmore College,
"The Risks of Foreign Policy as Political Distraction", The Atlantic,
June 15, 2017,
[[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/trump-diversionary-foreign-policy/530079/]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/trump-diversionary-foreign-policy/530079/),)

Today, some **[critics claim that Donald Trump will adopt a version of
the Wag the Dog strategy, and launch an actual major conflict to deflect
attention from the growing Russia scandal]{.underline}**. In the Daily
Beast, Michael Tomasky outlined a number of dangerous scenarios for a
"caged and cornered animal" like Trump, the first being that he "tries
to start a war," perhaps against North Korea. Distraction is indeed at
the core of Trump's foreign policy---but its role is far more subtle and
broadly applied. **[At present, the Trump administration finds itself
caught in just the sort of storm of circumstance that could lure it into
a diversionary foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[Trump certainly has a
motive to busy giddy minds, given the FBI's investigation into collusion
between his campaign and Russia, as well as approval ratings mired in
the 30]{.underline}**s. **[Because the president of the United States
has a relatively free hand to use force, Trump also has the opportunity
to divert attention.]{.underline}** (The White House can't impose its
will on healthcare, but it can unilaterally launch airstrikes.) **[In
addition, Trump has an unparalleled capacity to dominate the
news]{.underline}**. He may be the most famous person ever to stroll the
earth, or at least ride a golf cart. In January, by one account, Trump
received more media coverage than the next 1,000-most famous people put
together. On top of this, distraction has been a staple of Trump's
political strategy since he declared his intention to run for president.
**[When negative stories arise, his instinct is to seize the narrative
with bold, even outlandish, claims---accusing Barack Obama of
wiretapping the phones in Trump Tower, for example. If the diversion
sets off another firestorm, the solution is further deflection, like a
magician whose first trick goes up in smoke and then immediately begins
performing a new illusion]{.underline}**. Trump has the flexibility to
pursue a diversionary foreign policy because he lacks a clear diplomatic
doctrine. In some policy areas, such trade and immigration, he has been
consistent. But his positions on issues of war and peace have been
highly mutable---he was for the Iraq war and then against it,
pro-intervention in Libya before opposing this course of action, and
largely indecipherable on Afghanistan. This gives him greater latitude
to deploy smoke and mirrors when opportunities arise. What are the core
elements of a diversionary foreign policy? First of all, diplomatic
moves should be attention-grabbing, symbolic, and popular, particularly
among the base. The smartest diversionary actions also have some
substantive merit, precisely so the true agenda is harder to spot. After
all, giddy minds shouldn't know they've been busied. **[Ultimately, it's
not what the foreign policy does that matters, but what people think it
does]{.underline}**: the myths it creates, the stories it weaves, the
narratives it reinforces. In Trump's case, the tale is one of dark
enemies and unscrupulous allies. **[His diplomacy seeks to establish a
narrative of America First, a commitment to protect the U.S. homeland
even if---or especially if---it irritates global elites.]{.underline}**
Seen through this lens, much of Trump's behavior seems designed to
distract, however clumsily. **[Just consider the]{.underline}**
**[diversionary tweets]{.underline}**. The president has repeatedly
picked fights for his own political benefit by, for example, criticizing
London mayor Sadiq Khan and taking his words out of context to make him
appear weak on terrorism. Trump may see Khan, a foreign Muslim, as an
ideal foil given the embrace of anti-Muslim attitudes among some in the
Republican party. **[And then there's Trump's]{.underline}**
**[diversionary staging. When he decided to withdraw America from the
Paris climate deal, he could have given other nations maximum lead time
to help them handle the fallout. Instead, he hyped up his forthcoming
announcement, leading to frenzied debate about whether the United States
would stay or go, as if his sole concern was to boost ratings on a
reality television show]{.underline}**. **[But]{.underline}** **[what
about military force?]{.underline}** **[To be clear, there
is]{.underline}** **[little cause to speculate that Trump plans to
launch a full-scale war solely to distract attention]{.underline}**.
**[For one thing, as president, the]{.underline}** **[worst possible
time to start a major military campaign is when you're deeply
unpopular]{.underline}**. **[And the political upside is]{.underline}**
**[shaky at best]{.underline}**. **[Recent big wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq were politically damaging to George W. Bush. Even victory doesn't
guarantee a pay-off, as George H. W. Bush discovered when he won the
1991 Gulf War and then lost his bid for reelection in
1992.]{.underline}** A crisis may arise where there are real
national-security rationales for fighting, along with potential domestic
gains. Here, the payoff at home would likely enter Trump's calculus, and
even push him over the edge to fight, with the legitimate casus belli
providing a shield of plausible deniability. **[The most tempting use of
force may be a seemingly]{.underline}** **[manageable]{.underline}**,
**[but still dazzling, kinetic operation, like a]{.underline}**
**[missile strike]{.underline}** **[or a]{.underline}** **[raid to kill
terrorist leaders]{.underline}**. **[Another option would be to escalate
a crisis where an easy win seems available]{.underline}**: The key is to
find the right enemy, one that's both widely hated and too weak to fight
back. After all, there's a well-established "rally 'round the flag"
effect, where almost any military crisis temporarily juices the
president's approval ratings. In the wake of Clinton's airstrikes in
1998, one poll found that 68 percent of Americans approved of his
foreign policy. Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, "it was the
right thing to do at the right time."

### AT: Trade

Smoot--Hawley Myth and the Crisis", Review of International Political
Economy, 21(3), Taylor & Francis

**[Despite]{.underline}** the **[onset of]{.underline}** the current
**[economic crisis there has been no significant move towards
protectionism amongst most of the world\'s economies.
Although]{.underline}** rational institutionalist **[explanations point

**[O]{.underline}**rganisation, **[countries have largely remained open
in areas where they have not legally bound their
liberalisation]{.underline}**. While **[accounts
emphasising]{.underline}** the increasing
**[interdependence]{.underline}** of global supply chains have some
merit, I show that such explanations **[do not tell the full story, as
integration]{.underline}** into the global economy **[is not always
associated with support for free trade]{.underline}** during the crisis.
In response, I develop a constructivist argument which highlights how
particular **[ideas about]{.underline}** the **[global
trading]{.underline}** system **[have become rooted in policy-making
discourse, mediating the response of]{.underline}** policy **[elites to
protectionist pressures]{.underline}** and temptations. Trade
policy-makers and a group of leading economists have constructed an
ideational imperative for continued openness (and for concluding the
Doha Round, albeit less successfully) by drawing on a questionable
reading of economic history (the Smoot--Hawley myth); by continually
stressing protectionism\'s role as one of the causes of the Great
Depression non-liberal responses to the current crisis have been all but
ruled out by all except those willing to question the received wisdom.

#### Trade doesn't solve war

**Miller 14** -- Charles Miller, Lecturer at the Strategic and Defence
Studies Centre at the Australian National University, "Globalisation and
War", April, <http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/globalisation-and-war/>

John O'Neal and Bruce Russett's work is perhaps the best known in this
regard---and Steven Pinker cites them approvingly in his book The Better
Angels of Our Nature. **[Analysing trade and conflict
data]{.underline}** from the nineteenth to the twenty-first centuries,
**[they found that trade flows do have a significant impact in reducing
the chances of conflict, even when taking a variety of other factors
into account]{.underline}**. But their conclusions have in turn been
questioned by other scholars. For one thing, **[their model failed to
take three things into account]{.underline}**. First, **[it's quite
possible that peace causes trade rather than the other way around---no
company wants to start an export business to another country if it
anticipates that business linkages will be cut off by war further down
the line. Second, conflict behaviour exhibits what's called 'network
effects'--- if France and Germany are at peace, chances are Belgium and
Germany will be too. And third, both the likelihood of conflict and the
level of trade are influenced by the number of years a pair of countries
has already been at peace]{.underline}**---because prolonged periods of
peace increase mutual trust. **[Take any of these factors into account,
and studies have shown]{.underline}** (here and here) **[that the
apparent relationship between trade flows and peace
disappears.]{.underline}** Perhaps, though, conceiving of globalisation
solely in terms of trade flows is mistaken. Alternative indicators of
globalisation include foreign direct investment, financial openness and
the levels of government intervention in economic relations with the
rest of the world. Data on those variables is less extensive than on
trade flows, usually dating back only to the post World War II period.
But some analysts, such as Patrick McDonald and Erik Gartzke, have
argued that a significant correlation can be found between them and a
reduction in the probability of conflict. Those findings, newer than
O'Neal and Russett's, haven't yet been subjected to the same intense
scrutiny, so may in turn be qualified by future research. What does all
that mean for the policy-maker? **[The statistical evidence certainly
doesn't tell us that globalisation has made war in]{.underline}** East
Asia **[impossible.]{.underline}** 'Cromwell's law' counsels us that a
logically conceivable event should never be assigned a probability of
zero. The most we could conclude is that globalisation has made such an
occurrence much less likely. There's some hopeful numerical evidence
that globalisation does indeed have that effect, but the evidence isn't
so compelling that we can substitute an economic engagement policy for a
security policy. By all means, let's continue to promote trade in the
Asia-Pacific. But we should also continue to be prepared for scenarios
which are unlikely but would be hugely damaging if they were to occur.

#### Trump's trade doctrine is "America first" -- he'll ignore upcoming landmark WTO rulings against the US

**Reuters 17** "The Trump Administration May Ignore WTO Rulings It
Doesn't Like" Mar 01, 2017,
http://fortune.com/2017/03/01/trump-administration-wto-rulings/

U.S. President Donald **[Trump\'s administration is preparing to ignore
any rulings by the]{.underline}** **[W]{.underline}**orld
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[O]{.underline}**rganization **[that it sees
as an affront to U.S. sovereignty]{.underline}**, the Financial Times
reported on Tuesday, citing a report prepared by officials.

**[The draft document]{.underline}**, due to be sent to the U.S.
Congress on Wednesday, **[marks the first time the new administration
has laid out its trade plans in writing, the Times said.]{.underline}**

\"Ever since the United States won its independence, it has been a basic
principle of our country that **[American citizens are subject only to
laws and regulations made by the U.S. government---not rulings made by
foreign governments or international bodies]{.underline}**,\" the report
said, according to the Times.

\"Accordingly, the Trump administration will aggressively defend
American sovereignty over matters of trade policy,\" the report said,
according to the Times.

The Wall Street Journal, which also said it reviewed the document, said
**[the policy represents a dramatic departure from the Obama
administration, which emphasized international economic rules and the
authority of the WTO]{.underline}**, a body that regulates trade and
resolves disputes among its members.

By contrast, the Trump administration will more assertively defend U.S.
sovereignty over trade policy, ramp up enforcement of U.S. trade laws,
and use \"all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries
to open up their markets,\" the document said, according to the Journal.

The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for
comment.

Congress requires the president to submit the administration\'s trade
policy annually by March 1.

In the face of Republican concerns, a congressional aide said language
in the draft challenging the WTO could still be toned down in a final,
public version, the Journal reported.

**[Washington is facing several important WTO decisions, particularly
involving China]{.underline}**. **[Potentially the most important is a
WTO complaint filed in December by Beijing against the EU and the United
States for blocking China\'s request to be treated as a \"market
economy\" under the institution\'s rules.]{.underline}** A final ruling
could still be years away. But **[were the U.S. to ignore a finding in
China\'s favor it could have major consequences for the WTO as a venue
for resolving trade disputes before they fester into destructive trade
wars, the Times said.]{.underline}**

#### Trump is going to increase tariffs

**Rosenfeld 17** "Trump reportedly demands China action: \'I want
tariffs. And I want someone to bring me some tariffs\'" Everett
Rosenfeld - Asia Pacific Editor for CNBC.com, Mon, 28 Aug 2017,
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/27/trump-reportedly-demands-china-action-i-want-tariffs-and-i-want-someone-to-bring-me-some-tariffs.html

President Donald **[Trump recently dismissed some of his senior staff as
globalists and demanded that someone draw up a plan for tariffs that
would affect China]{.underline}**, Axios reported Sunday evening.

Citing multiple sources with knowledge of the meeting --- and noting
that the White House had not disputed the accounts ---the outlet
reported that Trump had issued the demand during an Oval Office meeting
with top advisors.

**[\"]{.underline}**So, John, **[I want you to know, this is my view. I
want tariffs. And I want someone to bring me some
tariffs,\"]{.underline}** Axios quotes the president as saying to John
Kelly, his chief of staff.

**[Trump then reportedly ended his meeting by saying: \"I know there are
some people in the room right now that are upset. I know there are some
globalists in the room right now. And they don\'t want them, John, they
don\'t want the tariffs. But I\'m telling you, I want
tariffs.\"]{.underline}**

People in **[the meeting]{.underline}** --- which **[was set to be about
plans to investigate China for]{.underline}**
**[i]{.underline}**ntellectual **[p]{.underline}**roperty
**[theft]{.underline}** --- included U.S. Trade Representative Robert
Lighthizer, trade advisor Peter Navarro, National Economic Council
Director Gary Cohn and then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon,
according to Axios.

Here\'s the non-denial that the White House gave to Axios: \"**[The
president has been very clear about his agenda as it relates to
trade]{.underline}**. Discussions pertaining to specific tariffs and
trade deals are ongoing and have already resulted in many positive
developments.\"

### AT: China

#### Trump more likely to divert through a deal with China than a war

**Kuttner 3/28** (Robert, co-founder and co-editor of The American
Prospect and professor at Brandeis University\'s Heller School, 2019,
"Trump and China: The Art of the Desperate Deal",
<https://prospect.org/article/trump-and-china-art-desperate-deal>, Aly
M)

**[Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, aims to change
that. He is dead serious about using America's economic and political
leverage to reset the U.S.-China relationship.]{.underline}** An anomaly
among Trump's appointees, Lighthizer is deeply knowledgeable about his
subject, strategically clear about his goals, and tactically astute as a
negotiator. And unlike his last four predecessors as USTR, Lighthizer
unabashedly embraces a salutary brand of nationalism. To use a very
old-fashioned word, Lighthizer is a patriot, someone who truly cares
about whether U.S. industry endures---and a far more serious man than
his boss.\
**[There's only one person who can undermine what Light-hizer is trying
to achieve. That would be Donald Trump.]{.underline}** Why? **[Because
Trump is looking for a quick deal that gives him bragging rights, while
Lighthizer is playing a long game for systemic change.\
After Trump waived his own March 1 deadline for a major increase in
tariffs on Chinese goods absent a major agreement, he sounded more and
more bullish about the prospects of an imminent deal, issuing tweets on
the great progress that has been made. On February 25, Trump crowed to a
White House gathering of the nation's governors that "we're going to
have another summit, we're going to have a signing summit, which is even
better, so hopefully we can get that completed, but we're getting very,
very close."\
The more Trump trumpeted success before progress had been agreed to, the
more he invited the Chinese to harden their line, and the more he
undercut his own negotiators. In reality, the deal that was on the table
in early March, when Beijing insisted on delaying the signing ceremony
several weeks pending further talks, was far from
adequate.]{.underline}** China had sought to sucker-punch Trump by
offering to purchase a lot more stuff---soybeans, beef, chickens,
natural gas, semiconductors---but not to make changes in China's
mercantilist system of state support for its own industries.\
**[You can understand the appeal of a deal. If Trump and China's
President Xi Jinping can announce an agreement consisting of specific
commitments to purchase lots more U.S. products, plus some vague, easily
evaded promises to reduce aspects of Chinese mercantilism, it will
produce several tactical wins for the president. First, it will divert
attention from Trump's other woes. Second, there will be favorable
headlines that Trump has come to his senses on tariffs and avoided a
"trade war" with China. Going into an election year, the farm lobby and
farm-belt voters will be relieved and grateful.]{.underline}** So will
the large segment of American corporations and banks that profit from
the status quo. The Dow will jump several hundred points, reflecting
both general approval and the prospect of increased exports and profits.
**[Best of all, the deal will be announced at Mar-a-Lago, with a smiling
Xi at Trump's side.]{.underline}**

### AT: North Korea

#### Trump won't start war with North Korea -- because he has them right where he wants them

**Arkin 2/25** (William M., long time military analyst, critic and
commentator who is writing a book for Simon & Schuster on ending the era
of perpetual war, 2019, "Say what you will about Trump, but his tactics
on North Korea are working",
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/say-what-you-will-about-trump-but-his-tactics-on-north-korea-are-working>,
Aly M)

**[Though it might seem like nothing has happened on North Korea since
Trump introduced denuclearization, and hence the near universal howl
against Trump's folly, consider the factual picture: North Korea
conducted one nuclear test during the Trump administration in September
2017 and has backed off even since then. Five underground tests were
held in the two previous administrations.]{.underline}** After a flurry
of longer and longer range missile activity in the first months of
Trump's rule, the North also hasn't conducted a long-range missile test
since November 2017. Provocations and incidents of other types have also
noticeably declined.\
No one quite knows why Pyongyang slowed its public and overt testing,
nor why Trump's bluntness and boasting that his nuclear button was
bigger seems to have worked. But consider this: Trump largely inherited
practices initiated in the Obama years, military moves that were meant
to threaten and coerce North Korea in light of its diplomatic failures.\
And so, from the beginning of the Trump administration, American B-1
bombers based in Guam accelerated mock bombing runs over the Korean
peninsula. US troop movements and readiness for war increased as well,
with larger exercises and more live fire drills. Ballistic missile
defenses of the United States, South Korea and Japan were all augmented
and increasingly netted together. According to intelligence officials,
cyber activity against North Korean military and nuclear targets
increased. A very large armada of US ships congregated closer to the
Korean Peninsula. More American missile-shooting submarines deployed
within range of the North in 2017 than at any time since the Korean war,
according to US navy data and military officials.\
Into this near autonomous skid towards conflict blundered Trump. It did
look grim for a few months, the two threatening strikes on each other,
missiles flying, and speculation even emerging that the United States
might move nuclear weapons back onto South Korean soil.\
**[But then a different course emerged, the denuclearization dream
vetoing the national security establishment's "tried and true"
practices. Much of the American activity stopped or slowed at the end of
2017. The navy pulled back and submarines were sent home. B-1 bombers
flew elsewhere. After the first summit meeting, some war games in South
Korea were canceled. There was even a gap between rotating army units
coming from the United States.\]{.underline}**
Meanwhile, a new leader in South Korea made significant overtures to the
North and the two sides increased their talks and meetings, ratcheting
down tensions and creating far better conditions for serious
negotiations. And slowly, though this could change on the whims of the
illustrators of doom, the ominous maps also pulled back. You know the
ones I'm talking about. First Guam and then Hawaii in range of the
North's missiles, then Alaska and California, all culminating with the
mushroom cloud and the dotted line moving closer to Washington DC
itself.\
With this second summit, the same cast of characters wants you to know
that North Korea is refusing to provide an inventory of its nuclear
program, that it is secretly building missiles and preparing this and
that new base, that it is modernizing its military, that it is trying to
break sanctions, that it is a cyber and even terrorist threat. And most
important, that it is fooling the president.\
Most of the leaks come from active saboteurs but some also just believe
they are protecting America. They want you to believe that doofus Trump
will willy-nilly agree to withdraw the near 30,000 American troops from
the peninsula, at the same time closing the nuclear umbrella over South
Korea and Japan. **[And, if he is successful, they want you to know that
he might divert attention from Robert Mueller and the border wall
debacle and all of what else might be more important to Washington.\
Say what you will about Trump, but after some very bad years of active
nuclear testing and missile shooting, disarmament on the Korean
peninsula has already occurred. Things are quieter and two leaders who
previously weren't talking -- ever -- now are. Sure the United States
should remain vigilant, but much of the penis-wagging and button-pushing
is over. To say no success has occurred is factually incorrect. Just
getting rid of the war cry is enough to cheer over.]{.underline}**
