Dear Mister / Madam President,

As the world's largest arms exporter, **[[the U.S. plays an outsize role
in fueling Latin America's insatiable addiction to
firearms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [To take one example, during most of
the 1980s, El Salvador was the largest consumer of U.S. military
hardware in the Americas, feeding one of the most vicious civil wars in
Latin American history. And while the conflict ended in 1992, the legacy
of its arms transfers remains: U.S. officials estimate that almost 50
percent of the weapons turning up in El Salvador's crime scenes are from
the U.S. Today, El Salvador registers the highest homicide rate
globally.]{.underline}

Maybe not surprisingly, **[[Latin American countries and cities are
among the planet's most prone to gun-related
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Approximately 75 percent of all
homicides in Latin America are caused by firearms, compared to the
global average of roughly 42 percent]{.underline}**. [In Brazil and
Honduras, the percentage of gun-related murders soars to close to 90
percent. **Handguns and assault rifles are of course not the cause of
homicide or violent crime, but their abundance and easy accessibility
certainly increase the risk of a lethal outcome during a dispute between
intimate partners or a holdup.**]{.underline}

**[[The sheer diversity and scale of arms and ammunition moving into
Latin America from the U.S., both in legal transfers and through
smuggling, constitutes a major policy challenge for your
administration]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To be sure[**, [the]{.mark}
region's [governments can take]{.mark} many worthwhile [steps, such as
strengthening arms export and import regulations, sharing intelligence
and introducing additional border and custom controls, and establishing
more oversight over local arms production]{.mark}**[ --- ]{.mark}not to
mention developing stricter management and marking of military, police
and private security arsenals**.** However, without stronger U.S.
control over the flow of arms south of the border, it will be difficult
for Latin American authorities to adequately confront the region's gun
menace**. Given the ready supply of firearms and ammunition [the U.S.
continues to provide as part of major security packages to Mexico,
Central and South America, you have a special obligation to ensure the
responsible export of arms and ammunition to the
region.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**[One way to accomplish this is by mandating greater accountability on
the part of the brokers and end-users involved in the
trade]{.underline}**. **[[This could be greatly aided if
Congress,]{.mark} under your leadership[, were to ratify the Arms Trade
Treaty,]{.mark} which the U.S. signed in 2013[, as well as expand
support for end-use monitoring programs such as Blue Lantern and Golden
Sentry, which have spurred thousands of checks into license requests and
suspicious transfers]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [Ramping up
bilateral support for military and police stockpile and inventory
management and surplus destruction will help prevent lawful guns from
being diverted into private --- and eventually
criminal --- hands.]{.underline}

**[You should [also support regional confidence-building mechanisms to
monitor legal and illegal arms transfers, trafficking and
leakage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This will require some coaxing of Latin
American governments to overcome the many political and economic factors
that frustrate regional cooperation. For example, Brazil, Colombia,
Mexico and Venezuela are actively seeking to expand their market share
in the defense sector --- especially in rifles, handguns and ammunition.
**[What is more[, several Central American governments mistrust one
another and the U.S. One way to surmount some of these challenges is to
encourage more Latin American countries to report to the UN Conventional
Arms Register, as well as the legally
binding OAS Firearms Convention.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Finally, consider providing targeted support to countries that are
reeling from the effects of armed violence, through support of regional,
national and local government and civil society efforts to strengthen
oversight over weapons stores and undertake targeted gun amnesty and
destruction campaigns]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Ultimately, special
efforts will be required to reduce corruption and increase transparency
in the security sector; improve legislation and controls over local
retail and ownership of firearms; improve and digitize record-keeping;
mark and trace arms; and ensure stringent oversight over exports and
imports. These kinds of measures, if pursued with fidelity, would go a
long way toward curbing the diversion of weapons and ammunition to those
who should not have them.
