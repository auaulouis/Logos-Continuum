### HIPHOP GOOD 

#### HIP HOP IS CRITICAL TO SOCIETAL PROGRESS AND A CATHARTIC EXPOSURE OF INJUSTICES TO SOCIETY

Pedagogy: Blue Scholarship to Challenge 'The Miseducation of the
Filipino'". <http://www.jceps.com/PDFs/04-2-08.pdf>. PWoods.

At the forefront in theorizing revolutionary critical pedagogies,
McLaren's work upholds the belief that [[the more conscious people
become of **exploitative social relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} that
lie at the root of a global division of labor and the corporatization of
our world, [[the more people will]{.mark}]{.underline} in quantity
[[become active in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[changing]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
**[[society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only through the imagination and
creation of a world outside of the capitalist law of value, will people
come to realize that struggle is their historic right and work to attain
the intense desires of freedom that burn within. Echoing this sentiment
in his latest book, Rage and Hope, McLaren asserts: [[**Revolutionary
critical pedagogy** can assist us in]{.mark} understanding history as
**a process**[in which human beings make their own
society]{.mark}]{.underline}, [although in conditions most often not of
their own choosing]{.underline} and therefore populated wit h the
intentions of others\...The actions of human beings are what shapes
history. History is not given form and substance by abstract categories.
The idea that a future society comes into being as a negation of the
existing one finds its strongest expression in class struggle (19). In
their lucid essay, "Rethinking Critical Pedagogy and the Gramscian and
Freirean Legacies," Peter McLaren and Gustavo Fischman answer a crucial
question presented in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks, where he poses: \"is
it better to 'think,' without having a critical awareness, \... or, on
the other hand, is it better to work out consciously and critically
one's own conception of the world?\" 30 [McLaren and Fischman highlight
[the importance of a collective critical consciousness that transcends a
social relation of domination]{.mark}]{.underline}as they support the
capacity of human beings **[to not only understand the world but more
importantly to transform it]{.underline}**. McLaren and Fischman recover
Gramsci's notion of hegemony from theorists who employ its use but
disregard the fundamental social contradictions between capital and
labor. Furthermore, they make clear that the strategy to recreate
society must take place not only in the transformation of civil society
but more comprehensively in the creation of proletari an hegemony. They
state: The problem with \[uncritical\] view\[s\] of hegemony is that in
their emphasis, to distance themselves from what they consider to be a
crude economism, they often seriously neglect the fundamental social
contradictions between capital and labor and resecured the prohibitions
on challenging th e contradictions of capitalism\... 31 They go on to
argue that such exclusions in Gramsci's notion of hegemony, have
effectively caused domination to hemorrhage into a pool of relational
negotiation s in which certain ideological positions are won through
consent. Here, we need to be reminded that intellectuals themselves are
always the products of new forms of collective labor power brought about
and consolidated by the forces of production. 3 2 Hip - Hop and the
Naming of the World Gramsci believed that "[ordinary men and women could
be educated into understanding the coercive and persuasive power
of]{.underline} capitalist [hegemony over them]{.underline}." 3
3[Gramsci highlighted the important roles of intellectuals who aligned
with subalterns and acted to transform the social existence of oppressed
communities]{.underline}. He states, [The]{.underline}\...[new
intellectual can]{.underline} no longer [consist]{.underline} in
eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and
passions, but [**in active participation in practical life**, as
constructor, organizer, 'permanent persuader, ' and **not just a simple
orator**]{.underline}. 3 4 As I have mentioned in my article, "Filipino
American Hip - Hop and Class Consciousness: Renewing the Spirit of
Carlos Bulosan," [the oral expression central to hip-hop comes from our
nation's racialized youth, who are surviving in a system that mandates
inequality and exploitation.]{.underline} 33 **[[Hip-hop
artists]{.mark}]{.underline}** often **[[speak "in active participation
in practical life" revealing people's present needs for adequate food,
shelter, and security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore,
[[hip-hop]{.mark} is an important musical outlet that [possesses the
ability to leave a lasting **imprint in the hearts and minds of the
struggling**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, the Seattle based group
Blue Scholars, contributesin the development of [[a **revolutionary
critical pedagogy**]{.underline}as]{.mark} they disseminate lyrical
messages that [[**demystify the exploitative nature of capitalism**
while at the same time **sharpen the lens for social analysis**, **untie
the tongue for cultural critique**, **and strengthen the heart for
activism among those who listen and relate**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Through their music, Blue Scholars assist in the development of a
critical consciousness by naming the world and helping to uncover the
material reality for many Filipinos and other oppressed communities who
are "shack led in the chains of international capital gain." 3 6 In
their song Southside Revival, Blue Scholars identify how the critique of
capital and the satisfaction of human needs are at the roots of their
musical philosophy: "Hungry is an adjective attached to my philosophy,
You got to be, progress revolves around economy. I can see the
consequences of capital first hand, Monorail construction push\[es\] the
tenants off the land." The Word Employed to Unveil and Transform The
musical duo of Blue Scholars, consisting of Filipino - American,
Geologic (vocals) and Sabzi (DJ) are examples of hip - hop artists who
serve as intellectuals and "permanent persuaders" whose purpose is to
serve the social groups with whom they share fundamental interests. They
use their music as an organizing tool to reclaim history, challenge what
is viewed as "natural," and engage with the masses in charting
alternativesto capitalism. Through their various performances in
mainstream concerts, community organized benefits, and anti-imperialist
conferences, Blue Scholars work to build relational knowledge of and
with the masses to help them develop a critical and collective
reflectiveness. As Paulo Freire emphasized, critical inquiry and
unveiling is not enough for social transformation. Freire asserts, If it
was possible to change reality simply by our witness for example, we
would have to think that reality is changed inside of our consciousness.
Then it would be very easy to be a liberatory educator! All we would
have to do is an intellectual exercise and society would change! No,
this is not the question. To change the concrete conditions of reality
mean a tremendous political practice, which demands mobilization,
organization of the people\...all these things, which are not organized
just inside the school . 3 7 Freire's words remind us that the
transformation of the society does not take place only within the
individual basis of self - reflection but through the collective actions
of people. Through their connection with the pro-democratic
organizations, [Blue Scholars directly engage with youth, workers, and
students in translating theory into concrete strategies for improving
their communities]{.underline}. Demonstrating this commitment, Blue
Scholars performed a benefit concert to financially support a national
Filipino youth conference organized by the group Sandiwa. 35 The
conference, in recognition of this year's centennial of Filipino
migration to the United States, brought Filipino youth from around the
country to critically examine the role Filipino s have played as cheap
labor in the sugar plantations of Hawaii, the agricultural fields of
California\'s Central Valley, and the canneries of the Pacific
Northwest. Sandiwa proclaims their hope "that this conference connects
our history with the ongoing s truggle millions of Filipinos face today
in search of new homelands away from the existing conditions in the
Philippines." In a workshop organized by the youth collective, Anakbayan
(whom Geo is an active member), to honor Filipino labor organizer,
writer , and activist, Carlos Bulosan, Anakbayan proclaims: we hope to
improve our conditions by studying and educating others about the rich
culture and proud revolutionary heritage of the Filipino peoples
continuing struggle. We also work towards building anti - imperialist
unity among all people to expose and oppose U.S. imperialist
intervention in the Philippines . 3 9 [Because their [music
is]{.mark}intimately[connected with]{.mark} Seattle's[working class
community of color who are **politically active** in **reflecting** and
**acting up on** the **problems that engulf their lives**,
]{.mark}]{.underline}Blue Scholars is not simply employing resistance
(which is largely passive and individual in focus) but [more
significantly **[serving as committed agents to make possible another
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Lyrical Examination [Blue Scholars' music
substantiate the testament that "'**[everyone' is a
philosopher]{.mark}** and that [it is not a question of introducing from
scratch a scientific form of thought into everyone's individual life,
**but of renovating and making 'critical' already existing
activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}." 40 In their song, "Wounded Eyes," Blue
Scholars reflect upon the conditions of their racialized and working
class communities who they describe as "poverty stricken folks,
constantly liv\[ing\] in hope. American dreams angling from a rope."
Further exposing the difficult realities many people face in their
communities, rapper, Geologic declares, "I study to survive\...
\...where the struggle and the hustle coincide. In this moment in time,
a shift in the tide. Get the blindfold lifted from your eyes, and see
what we see. And stop pretending it's all right." 41 Paralleling the
writings of Antonio Gramsci, Blue Scholars recognize that as artists
their music must not consist solely "in eloquence \[as\] an exterior and
momentary mover of feelings and passions." As "permanent persuaders" in
their community, [Blue Scholars utilize their music as an outlet for
study as well as a conduit to promote the transformation of the systems
that have left many without proper food, housing, and
education]{.underline}. In the same song, the y state, "My wounded eyes
seen through the lies. Many brutalized, so we rise and fight for the
future we strive. \...[Who am I? A student. Observing my environment to
see contradictions, In concrete conditions. Evidence we're living in an
obsolete system]{.underline}. \...I got folks working in the public
school sector, who lose one youth to death per semester. I guess the
cost of living is going up, While the chance of living is going down."
42 Supporting the dialectical process of praxis, Blue Scholars pull at
the roots of a material relation (between labor and capital) that
dehumanize those left with no other option but to sell their labor
power. Scrutinizing the personal effects of such a system, in his song
"Cornerstone" vocalist, Geologic rhymes how he, like many people, "don't
really own a damn thing, except for my labor. And maybe, a couple
thousand pages of my rhymes." He goes on to assert that this system has
placed our brains in a cage, unless "\...knowledge itself is given
proper prospective. To see how politicians keep the dollars
protected\... \[with their\] false prophesy, promising we will all be
free. As long as we fall in line with the flawed philosophy\...
\[while\]the ranks start to swell, in the hoods and jail cells." 43
Providing further explanation of this "f lawed philosophy" I turn to the
writings of Epifanio San Juan, Jr. At a talk he gave at the Carlos
Bulosan Symposium in Washington D.C., San Juan lucidly provides the
characteristics of the present social system that dichotomizes society
leaving the major ity "deprived of land, tools or animals\...confined to
sell their labor - power and do manual 'labor' while those free from
laboring with their hands, supposedly educated, occupy a higher position
or status." He maintains that those who occupy the lower rungs in this
division of labor are there not as "a result of being uneducated, but of
being dispossessed, racialized and colonized." 44 As I have shown with
the education policies in the Philippines and the United States, **[[the
educational apparatus in its present form legitimizes inequality by
assigning individuals to unequal social
positions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Blue Scholars provides further detail
into this system that disseminates a "false philosophy" to the majority
of the people in society. In their song "Commencement Day," Blue
Scholars sing, "you know they made curriculums designed to create
obedient drones." They elaborate, "They never tell you the conditions in
which to apply the math. Only 65 percent of your peers, freshman year,
are still here. And half that total will move on, But three out of four,
will drop out in two years. Add it up and it equals some shit has gone
wrong. Now the snakes gave the education budget rollback, No Child Left
Behind is just a backdoor draft\... It's the next generation of
miseducatedyouth , next time ask them for proof." 4 5 Lyrics such as
this strongly conflict with the endorsements made by educational
bureaucrats who claim that privatization is the panacea for students,
parents, and teachers. For instance, Education Secretary, Margaret Sp
ellings, recently defended the policy of No Child Left Behind stating
that "the law works." She argues that people who are "critical of the
law simply fear the results." 46 Ironically, Spellings is not entirely
wrong. Many youth of color, are fearful of r ecent education legislation
as they witness their peers entering militarized zones as opposed to
school zones. Authors such as Angela Davis and Mumia Abu - Jamal have
already revealed the harsh reality for many African Americans in the
United States whose a ttendance in prisons exceeds the numbers for those
in institutions of higher learning. Education, Economy, and War
Education in the Philippines was transformed in 1982 to further produce
the necessary labor for an export - oriented economy. In the United S
tates the economy does not evolve around export but rather a "military -
industrial complex." As the United States fights its wars in the
occupied countries of Afghanistan and Iraq, the country's labor force
must meet the demands of a war - based economy. Th e "backdoor draft"
that Blue Scholars allude to in their song "Commencement Day" further
discloses how No Child Left Behind is utilized to serve the labor needs
of the U.S armed forces. Currently, the U.S. ruling elites promoting the
occupations in the Mi ddleEast are calling for an expansion of their
"wars on terrorism" to such places as Iran and Venezuela. However,
public support for U.S imperial aggression dwindles reflected not only
in the millions of people who have taken to the streets in protest bu t
also in the military's failure to maintain monthly recruitment goals.
Provisions in NCLB legislation assist the U.S. military with their
recruitment problems. Buried on page 559 of the legislation's 670 total
pages, a small section requires that school s turn over names, phone
numbers, and addresses of all students to the military or risk losing
NCLB funding. 47 Succinctly explaining this precarious connection
between education policy and war, Blue Scholars explains that the
elite's "solution for the poo r, \[is to\] recruit them for the war." 48
The common denominator that links education and war is found in the
system of capitalism. 4 9 This is not a new phenomenon. Author and
social activist, Rosa Luxemburg, echoed these sentiments at the turn of
the 20 th century. She said, "if we consider history as it was not as it
could have been or should have been -- we must agree that war has been
an indispensable feature of capitalist development." 50 It is impossible
to omit war and imperialism in the histories of F ilipino Americans.
Echoing Luxemburg's words in their song, "The Long March," Blue Scholars
state, "War? What the fuck is it good for? Absolutely everything that
this country has stood for." 51 The words of both Rosa Luxemburg and
Blue Scholars, while ex pressed in two different centuries, embody a
continuing past, which began with the conquest of the Philippines and
carries on in its present forms characterized by U.S. "military
training" in the Philippines, secret prisons throughout Eastern Europe,
and t he ongoing occupations in the Middle East. Ever - imminent Hope
The central objective of education should be for the formation of men
and women with minds and attitudes that are in tune to the needs of its
people. This is expressed wonderfully in the music of Blue Scholars as
they state, "My purpose as of now is to serve the people to the
fullest." 52 [Serving the people of all colors, genders, ages, and
religions requires the development of a consciousness critical of our
present social order]{.underline}. As I have introduced throughout this
essay, the lyrics of [Blue Scholars participates in the development of
this consciousness by naming the world]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[developing a critical consciousness is]{.underline} only [the first
step]{.underline} in a collective path towards equality and justice.
[**Contrary** [to the widespread belief]{.mark} that "[**there are no
alternatives**" to **a system responsible for global environmental
degradation, widespread impoverishment, and perpetual war**, **we must
actively seek**]{.mark} to attain **[what many believe to be
impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The present system will not collapse
on its own]{.underline}. As it has transpired throughout history, the
small group of elites will continue to make the necessary changes of
appeasement in order to accomplish their parochial objectives for profit
and power. [For those who demand more, the lyrics of **Blue
Scholars**]{.underline} provide a strategy. They **[call us to "look
critical and begin to organize quietly, underneath the sugar coated
surface of society]{.underline}**." 53 [[Such messages **that inject the
people with courage and hope are indispensable in the long march
ahead**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The obstacles in our path will continue to
be great and for many they will seem be an unsurpassable. However,
closing with the words of Blue Scholars, "**[[No uprising fails. Each
one is a step forward towards the victory at the end of the
trail]{.underline}]{.mark}**." 54

#### HIP HOP HELPS TO BREAK DOWN DISEMBODIED WHITENESS

**Polson 12** (2012, Dana Roe Polson (PhD in Language Literacy and
Culture, UMBC, Baltimore city public and public charter schools high
school teacher), "'Longing for Theory:' Performance Debate in Action",
E-Book pp. 251-252, RaMan\]

[Further, the hip-hop music that animates many critical debate rounds is
a sonic disturbance to this quiet white space, an aural representation
of the Black bodies playing it. The presence of music in a debate round,
the Blackness of hip-hop, etc., all conspire against this disembodied
whiteness.]{.underline} As Duane Hartman said: \[Performativity\] deals
with the performance of the body. And being able to identify something
by the performance of the body. And [that doesn't necessarily have to be
active, you know, it could just be looking at you.]{.underline} What
makes a woman a woman is based on the performance of that body. And so
that gender becomes a performative identity. [And so their argument
became the way in which we express ourselves within debate, is based on
the performance of our bodies as Black males, Black females. (Hartman,
group interview I, p. 11) What might the "unique styles and expressions"
that Ede Warner and Jon Bruschke (both veteran collegiate debate
coaches) called for look like]{.underline}? Jason Burton described the
beginnings of performance debate at the University of Louisville as an
effort to increase participation of Black students. He said that the Ede
Warner, who was the founder of that program, "began to introduce hip-hop
music into debate rounds" as a way of doing so (Jason Burton, group
interview I, p. 3). T[he beginnings, then, had to do with changing the
style of debate to include culturally Black art as part of the debate
performance. These performances often still include hip-hop music, often
pre-recorded, as part of debate. In addition, to give just a few
examples,]{.underline} students from Paul Robeson High School have
played West African percussion and danced, read narratives about their
families, created poetry. Student participant Jessica Cooper describes
singing in debate, [as a way of being comfortable in debate by making it
relate to her experience: "\... in debate we, like I'll sing my first
speech because like, like first it was like a way for me to be
comfortable in the round\....For me, singing was a way for me to make
myself comfortable and a way for me to make debate relate to me and my
community"]{.underline} (Jessica Cooper, interview, p. 2).

momentary mover of feelings and passions." As "permanent persuaders" in
their community, [Blue Scholars utilize their music as an outlet for
study as well as a conduit to promote the transformation of the systems
that have left many without proper food, housing, and
education]{.underline}. In the same song, the y state, "My wounded eyes
seen through the lies. Many brutalized, so we rise and fight for the
future we strive. \...[Who am I? A student. Observing my environment to
see contradictions, In concrete conditions. Evidence we're living in an
obsolete system]{.underline}. \...I got folks working in the public
school sector, who lose one youth to death per semester. I guess the
cost of living is going up, While the chance of living is going down."
42 Supporting the dialectical process of praxis, Blue Scholars pull at
the roots of a material relation (between labor and capital) that
dehumanize those left with no other option but to sell their labor
power. Scrutinizing the personal effects of such a system, in his song
"Cornerstone" vocalist, Geologic rhymes how he, like many people, "don't
really own a damn thing, except for my labor. And maybe, a couple
thousand pages of my rhymes." He goes on to assert that this system has
placed our brains in a cage, unless "\...knowledge itself is given
proper prospective. To see how politicians keep the dollars
protected\... \[with their\] false prophesy, promising we will all be
free. As long as we fall in line with the flawed philosophy\...
\[while\]the ranks start to swell, in the hoods and jail cells." 43
Providing further explanation of this "f lawed philosophy" I turn to the
writings of Epifanio San Juan, Jr. At a talk he gave at the Carlos
Bulosan Symposium in Washington D.C., San Juan lucidly provides the
characteristics of the present social system that dichotomizes society
leaving the major ity "deprived of land, tools or animals\...confined to
sell their labor - power and do manual 'labor' while those free from
laboring with their hands, supposedly educated, occupy a higher position
or status." He maintains that those who occupy the lower rungs in this
division of labor are there not as "a result of being uneducated, but of
being dispossessed, racialized and colonized." 44 As I have shown with
the education policies in the Philippines and the United States, **[[the
educational apparatus in its present form legitimizes inequality by
assigning individuals to unequal social
positions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Blue Scholars provides further detail
into this system that disseminates a "false philosophy" to the majority
of the people in society. In their song "Commencement Day," Blue
Scholars sing, "you know they made curriculums designed to create
obedient drones." They elaborate, "They never tell you the conditions in
which to apply the math. Only 65 percent of your peers, freshman year,
are still here. And half that total will move on, But three out of four,
will drop out in two years. Add it up and it equals some shit has gone
wrong. Now the snakes gave the education budget rollback, No Child Left
Behind is just a backdoor draft\... It's the next generation of
miseducatedyouth , next time ask them for proof." 4 5 Lyrics such as
this strongly conflict with the endorsements made by educational
bureaucrats who claim that privatization is the panacea for students,
parents, and teachers. For instance, Education Secretary, Margaret Sp
ellings, recently defended the policy of No Child Left Behind stating
that "the law works." She argues that people who are "critical of the
law simply fear the results." 46 Ironically, Spellings is not entirely
wrong. Many youth of color, are fearful of r ecent education legislation
as they witness their peers entering militarized zones as opposed to
school zones. Authors such as Angela Davis and Mumia Abu - Jamal have
already revealed the harsh reality for many African Americans in the
United States whose a ttendance in prisons exceeds the numbers for those
in institutions of higher learning. Education, Economy, and War
Education in the Philippines was transformed in 1982 to further produce
the necessary labor for an export - oriented economy. In the United S
tates the economy does not evolve around export but rather a "military -
industrial complex." As the United States fights its wars in the
occupied countries of Afghanistan and Iraq, the country's labor force
must meet the demands of a war - based economy. Th e "backdoor draft"
that Blue Scholars allude to in their song "Commencement Day" further
discloses how No Child Left Behind is utilized to serve the labor needs
of the U.S armed forces. Currently, the U.S. ruling elites promoting the
occupations in the Mi ddleEast are calling for an expansion of their
"wars on terrorism" to such places as Iran and Venezuela. However,
public support for U.S imperial aggression dwindles reflected not only
in the millions of people who have taken to the streets in protest bu t
also in the military's failure to maintain monthly recruitment goals.
Provisions in NCLB legislation assist the U.S. military with their
recruitment problems. Buried on page 559 of the legislation's 670 total
pages, a small section requires that school s turn over names, phone
numbers, and addresses of all students to the military or risk losing
NCLB funding. 47 Succinctly explaining this precarious connection
between education policy and war, Blue Scholars explains that the
elite's "solution for the poo r, \[is to\] recruit them for the war." 48
The common denominator that links education and war is found in the
system of capitalism. 4 9 This is not a new phenomenon. Author and
social activist, Rosa Luxemburg, echoed these sentiments at the turn of
the 20 th century. She said, "if we consider history as it was not as it
could have been or should have been -- we must agree that war has been
an indispensable feature of capitalist development." 50 It is impossible
to omit war and imperialism in the histories of F ilipino Americans.
Echoing Luxemburg's words in their song, "The Long March," Blue Scholars
state, "War? What the fuck is it good for? Absolutely everything that
this country has stood for." 51 The words of both Rosa Luxemburg and
Blue Scholars, while ex pressed in two different centuries, embody a
continuing past, which began with the conquest of the Philippines and
carries on in its present forms characterized by U.S. "military
training" in the Philippines, secret prisons throughout Eastern Europe,
and t he ongoing occupations in the Middle East. Ever - imminent Hope
The central objective of education should be for the formation of men
and women with minds and attitudes that are in tune to the needs of its
people. This is expressed wonderfully in the music of Blue Scholars as
they state, "My purpose as of now is to serve the people to the
fullest." 52 [Serving the people of all colors, genders, ages, and
religions requires the development of a consciousness critical of our
present social order]{.underline}. As I have introduced throughout this
essay, the lyrics of [Blue Scholars participates in the development of
this consciousness by naming the world]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[developing a critical consciousness is]{.underline} only [the first
step]{.underline} in a collective path towards equality and justice.
[**Contrary** [to the widespread belief]{.mark} that "[**there are no
alternatives**" to **a system responsible for global environmental
degradation, widespread impoverishment, and perpetual war**, **we must
actively seek**]{.mark} to attain **[what many believe to be
impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The present system will not collapse
on its own]{.underline}. As it has transpired throughout history, the
small group of elites will continue to make the necessary changes of
appeasement in order to accomplish their parochial objectives for profit
and power. [For those who demand more, the lyrics of **Blue
Scholars**]{.underline} provide a strategy. They **[call us to "look
critical and begin to organize quietly, underneath the sugar coated
surface of society]{.underline}**." 53 [[Such messages **that inject the
people with courage and hope are indispensable in the long march
ahead**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The obstacles in our path will continue to
be great and for many they will seem be an unsurpassable. However,
closing with the words of Blue Scholars, "**[[No uprising fails. Each
one is a step forward towards the victory at the end of the
trail]{.underline}]{.mark}**." 54

### ! -- WHY PERFORMANCE GOOD

#### DEBATERS OF COLOR STILL FACE RACIST PREJUDICE AND ARE OFTEN FORCED TO EMBODY THE "GHETTO KID GONE GOOD" NARRATIVE 

**[Reid-Brinkley, 12]{.underline}** \[\"ARGUMENTATION AND ADVOCACY.TR
\"*Argumentation and Advocacy* 49 (2012): 77-99.\]

[I remember one particular incident that most clearly highlighted my
sense of discomfort. I was still in college and maintaining my \"poster
child\" relationship with the UDL.]{.underline} Melissa Wade, my college
debate director at Emory University, was contacted by [a production
company that wanted to put together a human-interest segment to be
broadcast by a number of local news stations along the east
coast]{.underline}. In addition to interviewing Wade the producers also
[requested an interview with the two African American students on the
Emory team who had been former members of the university\'s outreach
program, and I was one of those students.]{.underline} I put on a nice
suit (one my mom picked out and paid what was, at the time, a lot of
money for her and my dad to spend) and went to the interview, conducted
in the middle of the central two-block quadrangle on the university\'s
campus. Emory\'s architecture is quite beautiful. The quad \'-vas almost
two blocks of open green space where students played Frisbee, studied
while sunbathing, or attended class on a beautiful spring day. The quad
is bound on all sides by clean, light-marble buildings. Everything is
incredibly bright and fresh, gleaming in the Georgia sunshine[. The
interview went well, the reporter asking about my debate career and the
UDL program. The interviewer thanked me for my time and I went on my
way. A few weeks later, my debate coach called me into her office for a
chat. It seemed that the producers would like to interview me again,
this time while touring the inner-city community where I had grown up
and the high school I had attended.]{.underline} I wanted to know why
they had made that request before I made a decision. The producer agreed
to call me within a few days. [With that time to think about the
request, I began to visualize what the edited version of the piece would
look like. They would show my interview on campus and contrast the image
of the university\'s economic privilege with the \"darker\" image of my
inner-city community It was the \"ghetto kid gone good\" narrative that
had already begun to make me uncomfortable.]{.underline} The producer
finally called [and I expressed my concern about their need to contrast
my economic (and racial) background to that of my college environment as
a means of sensationalizing my story. I simply wondered why my
achievements, which were the focus of the interview, could not stand on
merit alone. The producer was completely clueless and after going in
circles with her for 20 minutes, I realized we were not going to get
anywhere. At the end of our conversation, she stated \"But, I don\'t
understand, I mean you did go to school there.\" I told her that I would
not be granting them a second interview and terminated the conversation.
The representation of successful UDL students is of human-interest
appeal. It contrasts with the dominant narrative that constructs
inner-city children of color as deviant and intellectually inferior.
Yet, the representation of success is extremely restrictive, requiring
the embodiment and enactment of the \"ghetto\" at-risk youth narrative
to produce the transformative discourse of exceptionalism read tokenism.
The repetition of the dangerous urban youth of color character as the
most used representation of UDL students suggests an inability of news
media to tell the success stories of inner-city students of color
outside this frame]{.underline}. The texture ami [complexity of the
lives of UDL students is lost within the constraints of a pre-determined
frame that restricts these students to the scripts made available to
them in a society bound by the ontological standard of whiteness at the
intersection ofthe material privileges associated with economic
wealth.]{.underline} As a 20-year-old, I lacked the vocabulary to fully
articulate my discomfort with the scripts made available to me. What I
intuitively understood to be happening was ignored by the news producer
and by every other media representative I encountered. I am an
\"outsider within,\" to use Patricia Hill Collins\'s (1998) term, one
\"who no longer belong\[s\] to any one group\" (p. 5). [I occupy a
borderland space between various communities, including the academy, the
UDL, college debate, and the black community in which I was raised,
where all or part of my subjectivity can be rejected or vilified at any
moment.]{.underline} It is within this liminal space that I engage in an
oppositional reading of the discourses surrounding UDL students in news
media representation. Such an oppositional reading recognizes and
engages the dominant, or suggested, reading offered within a field of
signification (Hall, 1997). Rather than offering an alternative or more
positive reading in opposition to the suggested read, I seek to
highlight the modalities by which racialized representation reproduces
itself.

#### The narrative is written for us, affirming the media's racial bias, but that doesn't mean we except those conditions. 

**[Reid-Brinkley, 12]{.underline}** \[\"ARGUMENTATION AND ADVOCACY.TR
\"*Argumentation and Advocacy* 49 (2012): 77-99.\]

Earlier in this essay, I drew on Karen Houppert\'s (2007) article,
\"Finding Their Voices,\" in the Washington Post to discuss the framing
of familial dysfunction. Houppert, profiling Baltimore Urban Debate
League student Ignacio \"Iggie\" Evans, asks personal questions about
Evans\'s family background. [Houppert notes that while Evans was
initially reticent about sharing his story, she persisted and eventually
convinced her interview subject to reveal sensitive information about
his personal background]{.underline}. Three years after the original
interview in August 2007, Houppert (2010) published a follow up article
entitied [\"Whatever Happened To .. . the Baltimore high school
debater?\" Evans, at the time of the article\'s publication, was in his
junior year of college at Towson University and along with his debate
partner was well on his way to being a formidable competitor on the
national college policy debate circuit.]{.underline} Houppert\'s (2010[)
second article begins with a summary of what believes to be the relevant
information from the first article. Still misspelling his name, she
reported: Iggy was a kid who had a lot of strikes against him. He never
knew his biological dad. His mom struggled with drug addiction, and he
landed in foster care. He attended Baltimore\'s Frederick Douglass High
School, one of four failing Baltimore schools slated for takeover under
the No Child Left Behind Act. His odds of success were poor. Here we
have a reproduction of the familial dysfunction and failing
community/school frames, which is followed by the narrative of
exceptionalism that identifies debate as Evans\'s savior: But Iggy, an
argumentative kid, found a way to channel his contrariness through the
wildly popular Baltimore Urban Debate League, a program chat teaches the
fundamentals of democracy-as well as critical thinking, basic literacy
and research skills-to underprivileged students.]{.underline} {Houppert,
2010, para. 3) [The repetition of the narrative frames associated with
black youths, in this example, demonstrates the difficulty these
students will have in any attempt to escape this narrative\'s social
intelligibility. The narrative frame may be quite difficult to overcome
because of its intelligibility to audiences trained to process the
classed and racialized redemptive narrative.]{.underline} Yet, the final
paragraph of the Houppert (2010) follow up article on Evans may offer a
glimpse at potential tactics students and supporters might use to
respond to the context of the frame when engaging with media
representatives[: Meanwhile, he continues to question what it means to
be a black man in America today, personally and politically. Though
Towscn is only a half-mile north of the Baltimore city limits, Iggy\'s
sense of displacement is profound. \"My biggest challenge is being able
to authentically perform who I am in these spaces,\" Iggy says. \"At the
very least, debate has taught me to relentlessly defend my position as a
black man and to understand my community\'s needs.\"]{.underline}
\|para. 8) [Evans does not speak to the obstacles he faced as a young
man; it is Houppert who summarizes that part of the initial
story.]{.underline} [Evans focuses the discussion away from the
racialized poverty frame that positions blackness and urban communities
as spaces from which to escape, to his community as a place to direct
the resources made available to him through debate training and a
college education]{.underline}. Rather than demonize his community[,
Evans indicates both a love and support for the very community that
Houppert has characterized as nothing but deviant with dilapidated
school systems and failing students. The Houppert/ Evans example, while
demonstrating the strength of the frame, simultaneously indicates that
students can engage the frame, attempting to create alternative scripts
to those that are normally intelligible.]{.underline} Given the audience
for this journal, I think the readership might be more interested in a
discussion of the potential responses available for UDL students and
supporters to this normative media frame, rather than a focus on what
the media might do to resolve this problem. I attempt to offer some
possible tactics and strategies for engaging the news media given the
prevalence of the frame. First, UDL students should be trained to
interact with journalists. Anyone who has worked with UDL students knows
that they are often incredibly intelligent and quite sensitive to and
reflexive about issues of representation. [Thus, investing time in
training UDL advocates, teachers, and coaches in media tactics, in order
to educate the students, may be a significant tool in supporting student
agency in the shaping of their representation. Students can learn to
pivot the dominant frame. Knowing that the exists and how it functions
may offer students the opportunity to interact with the frame, engaging
in oppositional discourse designed to disrupt the normative scripts made
available within the racialized poverty frame.]{.underline} Second, UDL
administrators and teachers might consider broaching the subject of the
normative frames used in a majority of news representation of the UDL
with journalists interested in featuring the program\'s students. [Those
journalists who are unwilling to reject or, at the very least,
interrogate the racialized poverty frame should potentially be denied
access to the students. All interactions between journalists and
students could be recorded by a UDL representative, likely a good common
practice as a means of protecting the interests of the students given
their ages. In addition, those recordings could be used to further
engage media outlets in conversations about what narratives journalists
have chosen to focus their attention upon versus what may have been said
in the actual interview.]{.underline} Lastly, [administrators and
teachers might turn to minority and alternative news press outlets as
options for more complex representations of the UDL and its students.
Future research into UDL representation should evaluate the framing and
scripting techniques of these alternative presses.]{.underline} The
suggestions I offer, however, must be considered within the [context of
a dominant narrative that will be difficult, if not impossible, to
replace through individual and even institutional acts of agency. The
issue here is one of the intelligibility of representations and the
scripting of racialized narratives on the corporeal bodies of
those]{.underline} [coded as black in the social
imagination.]{.underline}

When thinking about black female spectators, I remember being punished
as a child for staring, for those hard intense direct looks children
would give grown-ups, looks that were seen as confrontational, as
gestures of resistance, challenges to authority. [**[The \"gaze\" has
always been political in my life. Imagine the terror felt by the child
who has come to understand through repeated punishments that one\'s gaze
can be dangerous. The child who has learned so well to look the other
way when necessary.]{.mark}** Yet, when punished, the child is told by
parents, \"Look at me when I talk to you.\" Only, the child is afraid to
look. Afraid to look, but fascinated by the gaze. There is power in
looking]{.underline}. Amazed the first time I read in history classes
that white [slaveowners (men, women, and children) punished enslaved
black people for looking, I wondered how this traumatic relationship to
the gaze had informed black parenting and black spectatorship. **[The
politics of slavery, of racialized power relations, were such that the
slaves were denied their right to gaze]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Connecting this strategy of domination to that used by grown folks in
southern black rural communities where I grew up, I was pained to think
that there was no absolute difference between whites who had oppressed
black people and ourselves. Years later, reading Michel Foucault, I
thought again about these connections, about the ways power as
domination reproduces itself in different locations employing similar
apparatuses, strategies, and mechanisms of control. Since I knew as a
child that [the dominating power adults exercised over me and over my
gaze was never so absolute that I did not dare to look, to sneak a peep,
to stare dangerously, I knew that the slaves had looked. That all at
tempts to repress our/black peoples\' right to gaze had produced in us
an overwhelming longng to look, a rebellious desire, an oppositional
gaze. By courageously looking, we defiantly declared: \"Not only will I
stare.]{.underline}

African Diaspora is not necessarily very queer. Diaspora, from the
Greek, meaning the scattering of seed or sperm is classically
patriarchal, and impossibly patrilineal. Diaspora is the name for an
assumption that despite the disruption of a desired linearity, Africa
survives. The study of the African Diaspora, conceived within a
pan-african political movement, is the pursuit of an impossible
lineage.6 While the search for Africanisms, or African survivals in
diaspora seeks to create a natural Blackness, I would suggest that this
is a contradiction. For Africa to survive at all in the Americas is a
queer thing.

recruitment of other¶ diverse groups, such as: Latinos, Native
Americans, disabled populations, and LGBT¶ students. Additionally, the
inclusion of different values and perspectives adds another¶ level of
training for the future movers and shakers of society. If debaters are
trained to¶ make policy for diverse populations, then understanding the
difference in cultures, values¶ and perspectives of these groups is an
invaluable experience. Ultimately, these¶ standpoints are necessary for
the growth and development of every member of the Debate¶ community.
Unfortunately, the backlash to alternative debate has overshadowed the¶
73¶ benefits of including alternative debate for much of the community.
Therefore, research¶ on the clash of civilization debates is an
essential and timely endeavor.¶]{.underline} [The speech community model
of analysis has been a productive model for¶ examining the ways in which
the prioritizing of traditional debate norms and procedures¶ has served
to exclude Black discourse, values, and perspectives. While it is not
always¶ an intentional act of exclusion, the effects can often be just
as injurious. The debate¶ about Debate, that has been ongoing within
Intercollegiate Policy Debate, has provided¶ an excellent opportunity to
examine how the exclusion of different discourse strategies¶ can
ultimately lead to the exclusion of an entire culture, their values, and
their¶ experiences.]{.underline}¶ With the recent growth of the Black
student population in Debate, the community¶ has been introduced to new
methods of debate. [As a result of the increased use of¶ alternative
methods, the discussions regarding the community's best practices have¶
become a site of contention for many of its members. The hostility
surrounding the¶ debate about Debate is at an all-time high and the
community is split along the lines of¶ stylistic choice. Additionally,
this split has also segregated the community along lines of¶ race. The
effects of this conflict have left these Black students stigmatized and¶
constantly fighting to be recognized as valuable members of the Debate

only are these Black debaters negatively¶ affected, but the entire

### A2 PERFORMANCE BAD FOR DEBATE

#### Suggesting that performance is "bad for debate" only reinforces neutrality and causes a vicious cycle of violence 

**Polson 12** (2012, Dana Roe Polson (PhD in Language Literacy and
Culture, UMBC, Baltimore city public and public charter schools high
school teacher), "'Longing for Theory:' Performance Debate in Action",
E-Book pp. 16-18, RaMan)

Finally, situation or context is the third aspect of genre and our
attempts to find meaning in genre. The context embraces content and form
and "enable\[s\] interpretation of the action resulting from their
fusion" (ibid). [What is the context that enables interpretation of
critical debate?]{.underline} I think that is a contested question. Many
members of the traditional debate community find critical debate "bad
for debate." P[erformance debate proponents might say that they are
directly challenging traditional debate conventions that have become
mechanistic and are inherently racist, and that debate must find new
ways of becoming less exclusive and more relevant.]{.underline}
[Specifically, many debate community members such as Preston (a coach
and author) suggest that traditional debate practices and pedagogy
result in difficulty recruiting minority debaters.]{.underline} He cites
Hill as having "noted that learning and communication styles of African
Americans may differ from the learning and communication norms of the
policy debating community" (Preston, Jr., 2006, p. 162). A call to solve
this problem becomes one of the foundations of performance debate
practice. T[hrough content and form, performance debaters call for and
demonstrate a practice that is inclusive and challenges the norms of the
community. Reid-Brinkley quotes a Louisville debater in-round: The
university of Louisville enacts a full withdrawal from the traditional
norms and procedures of this debate activity.]{.underline} Because this
institution, like every other institution in society, has also grown
from the roots of racism. Seemingly neutral practices and policies have
exclusionary effects on different groups for different reasons. These
practices have a long and perpetuating history. (Reid-Brinkley, 2008, p.
114) R[eid-Brinkley argues that many performance debate tactics are
rhetorical strategies "designed to disrupt the normativity of
traditional debate practices\.... genre violation \[is\] a means of
using style and performance to combat the social ideologies that result
in unequal power relations across race, gender, and class within the
national policy debate community" (pp. 78-79). Reid-Brinkley identifies
four types of genre violations in critical debate: sonic and spatial
disruption, violations of strategic norms, violations of expectations
regarding the resolution, and violations of the policymaker debate
persona.]{.underline} We can see here the interplay of content, form and
context in her argument. [The disruptive aural presence of rap music in
a debate round, for example, is not coincidental to a substantive
message critiquing Eurocentric epistemology and white-normed debate
practices]{.underline}, for example. I will discuss such genre
violations much more in Chapter 5, as I explain performance debaters'
attempts to do debate rather than just talking about it \[social
change\].

### RAP GOOD 

**The world is Eurocentric -- that's bad -- prefer Afrocentrism**

**Asante '98** (Molefi Kete Asante, Professor and Chair, Department of
Africology & African American Studies at Temple University, 1998,
Dancing between Circles and Lines, "The Afrocentric Idea")\\\\AK

Afrocentrity cannot abandon the structuralism of modernism without
betraying the achievements of culture. African Americans are a
preeminently cultured people within American society, and our
contributions to what is called \"popular American culture\" are
immense. To seek to transcend the African cultural presence in
contemporary society is to quest for anonymity at the very time that
African Americans and Africans are most capable of asserting their
culture. Robert Farris Thompson has argued that [[the modern world
is]{.mark} fundamentally [a world created by the presence of Africans in
the Americas]{.mark}.\" Thus, [African presence]{.mark} in art, science,
Egyptology, literature, politics, and democracy [is a decisive force in
the]{.mark} modern [world as it either affirms or rejects]{.mark} that
[presence]{.mark}.]{.underline} That we Africans have been involved in
making the modem world is precisely why Afrocentrists question the
abandonment of modernism. We are not, however, running away from
ourselves, and while we are in the midst of projecting ourselves to the
world, we do not lose sight of the structural ideas of location, place,
and stance. Nevertheless, the quest for transcendence, in the sense of
going beyond the simple affirmation or rejection of African presence,
does not have to be detrimental to good society; it can be affirming and
fulfilling so long as an Afrocentric agency is constituted in the
creation of a new world. [We must conclude that [modernism\'s problem is
with the use of Africans rather than]{.mark} with the [agency]{.mark} of
Africans. If this unsettles some to the point that they question the
restructuring of the world, [it serves to demonstrate that]{.mark} the
[deconstruction]{.mark} process [was never completed]{.mark} in the
first place. If it had been completed, it would have had to serve up the
abandoned concepts of white racism on the altar of progressive sacrifice
so that we could have a more fully creative world.]{.underline} What
needs to be deconstructed are the means by which human beings in the
Western world have defined a triumphal vision that diminishes other
people. I know that this is a diffiasdfacult road for those who are
committed to the detours of literary analysis and historical
speculation, because once again we are in the area of the forbidden when
we question the Eurocentric ideas about culture. [Unless they are
subjected to severe criticism, [the]{.mark} preponderant [Eurocentric
myths of universalism, objectivity, and classical traditions retain a
provincial European cast.]{.mark} Scholarship rooted in such myths
obviously lacks either historical or conceptual
authenticity.]{.underline} The aggressive seizure of intellectual space,
like the seizure of land, amounts to occupying someone else\'s territory
and claiming it as one\'s own. When this occurs, cultural analysis takes
a back seat to galloping ethnocentric interpretations of phenomena.
[[Applied to the African world, such conceptions become limiting,
restricting, and parochial]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, a
discussion of African cultural history rarely calls forth African
culture in the American context when the discussion is made by
Eurocentric writers. Like the literary critics, the historians dismiss
the African elements that survived and developed on the American
continents as purely temporal. They usually refer to them as \"Negro
culture,\" or speak of \"the African slave in the New World or \"Newt)
emancipation.\" The fact that the spatial referent is Africa is ignored,
and Negro becomes a cryptoterm that is used to designate our
degradation. In this way the Eurocentric writer ties the African to the
Negro, a false concept and a false history, separate from any particular
spatial reality. The word Negro did not exist prior to slavery; both the
term and its application were products of the social and economic
context of the slave trade. Consequently, the attachment of the term
Negro to African means a. negation of history and culture. Furthermore,
the Eurocentric formulations recognize neither African classical thought
nor the African classical past. We are essentially left with a
discontinuous history and an uncertain future. By contrast, the
Afrocentric analysis reestablishes the centrality of the ancient Kemetic
(Egyptian)civilization and the Nile Valley cultural complex as points of
reference for an African perspective in much the same way that Greece
and Rome serve as reference points for the European world. [Thus, the
[Afrocentrist expands]{.mark} human [history by creating a. new path for
interpretation]{.mark}, making words like Negro and colored obsolete and
anachronistic. [African is identified with time, place, and
perspective.]{.mark} Without the Afrocentric perspective, [the
imposition of the European line as universal hinders cultural
understanding and demeans humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Nommo is the signification of the power of Black rhetoric -- it is not
just a communicative event, but a communal experience that facilitates
reclamation**

Thus, [[nommo in Afrocentricity signifies the generative power of the
spoken word. The generative function of nommo stems from its focus on
collectivity]{.mark}, which is the essence of African American
spirituality.]{.underline} According to Hamlet (1998), [[nommo is
necessary]{.mark} not only to actualize life but also [to give people a
mastery over things]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nommo's presence can be felt
in all facets of African American life, including interpersonal, group,
public, or mass communication events in which African culture and
experiences are fused[. It is [the quality of nommo that has shaped the
perception of African Americans to regard a communication event]{.mark}
not just as an act where words are spoken in the presence of an
audience, but also [as a communal experience]{.mark} [where]{.mark}
those [words, songs, dance]{.mark}, and so on [give life and meaning to
the event]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the Afrocentric perspective, rhythm,
like speech, must coincide with the generative power of the word so that
the communicator, word, and audience are all of one accord. Rhythm plays
a crucial role in Afrocentric discourse. It is that force that helps to
bring about harmony. Rhythm in the African American context is described
as \`\`the architecture of being . . . only rhythm gives (the word) its
effective fullness'' (Jahn, 1961, p. 161). Asante (1987) seesrhythm
asthe\`\`basis of African American transcendence'' (p.38).Transcendence
is conceived here \`\`not as an escape from but as a reconciliation of
the dualities of existenceömind vs. body, sacred vs. profane, America
vs. Africa'' (G. Stephens, 1991, p.74). In rap music, the musical
elements combine to provide rhythm that facilitatesrhyme and other forms
of expressions such as dance[. Another quality of Afrocentric rhetoric
is [the call-response function]{.mark}, also known as \`\`harmony
indicators'' in Asante's parlance. The rapper [seeks harmony by
summoning the audience to participate]{.mark} in the
rapping.]{.underline} According to Keyes (1984), \`\`call-response is an
interactive network between performer and auditor. The role of such
discourse is to unify and establish cohesiveness. . . . The execution of
a rap depends on this interplay between the participants and
communicative resources within context'' (p. 146). [Thus, [rap music,
with its rich lyrics, rhythm, and poetry]{.mark}, helps [bring the
audience]{.mark} members [to]{.mark} participate and [identify]{.mark}
[with the rapper]{.mark}. In sum, then, African American
[rhetoric,]{.mark} [including]{.mark} [rap]{.mark} music, often
[manifests]{.mark} several characteristics of [nommo]{.mark}.They are
rhythm, soundin' out, repetition, stylin', lyrical quality,
improvisation, historical perspective, indirection, call and response,
and mythication.]{.underline} Rhythm demonstrates how well a speaker
regulates his=her flow of words with correct pauses and
intensifications. In African American culture, words are often expressed
musically and rhythmically and function as a basic measure of the
success of the speaker (Asante,1987). An example, among many, would be
Sugarhill Gang's\`\`Rappers Delight.

[Historical perspective in African American [discourse is used as a way
to motivate audiences to look to their own culture for
inspiration]{.mark}, wisdom, and strength [in order to survive]{.mark}
and grow [in]{.mark} a [racist America]{.mark} (Hamlet,
1998).]{.underline} Throughout history in America, [[music has]{.mark}
always [been one of the few ways African Americans have been able to
express themselves freely.]{.mark} It has been used, in whatever form,
[to articulate their deepest and most enduring feelings and
certainties]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some scholars have stated that it is
in the secular song where the record of African American people's
consciousness can be found (Cummings & Daniel, 1979). [[Rap]{.mark}
music [is an extension of this]{.mark} legacy. [Rappers]{.mark}, as the
contemporary griots, [are expected to be fluent, to testify, to speak
the truth]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smitherman,1997). Kool Moe Dee's
\`\`PumpYour Fist'' is a prime example. In this rap, he speaks of
liberation as the responsibility of the oppressed. Similarly, in their
rap anthem, \`\`Proud to Black,'' Run-DMC speak of racial pride unlike
any other artist since James Brown's \`\`I'm Black and I'm Proud''.
Their lyrics are fiery, innovative, artistic, and patriotic: One of the
most enduring and recognizable characteristics of nommo is call and
response. In the African American communication setting, the
communicator is not a solitary voice[. There is usually [a high level of
synergy present between the communicator and]{.mark} \[their\]
[audience]{.mark}. The audience [members]{.mark} typically
[participate]{.mark} in the speaking or concert event [by calling and
responding to the communicator]{.mark} in different ways. [This]{.mark}
back-and-forth [interaction]{.mark} between the audience and
communicator [is an art]{.mark} form [that provides]{.mark} the audience
with [an opportunity to]{.mark} react favorably to the message while
[helping]{.mark} the communicator [establish a common ground]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [\[themselves\] and the audience]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Religious events are replete with call7response interactions, but so are
secular events, including rap music. Oftentimes rap music functions as a
conversation drama in which the rappers invite the listeners to
participate in the dynamic process of call and response as in the case
of KRS-One's\` \`Who Protects Us from You'':

Our sense of uncertainty about the future is compounded by a sense of
uncertainty about our own courses of action. And we can tackle at least
one of those things. To that end, let's move away from universalizing
and abstraction: away from "what is to be done" to "what are we -- you
and me -- going to do:" grounding ourselves in the fact that
**[[oppression is not theoretical. Violence is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
not abstract; it is intimate, visceral and
**[[material]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[[the
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which **[[we
resist]{.mark}]{.underline}** that violence **[[need
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** likewise **[[be]{.mark}]{.underline}**
intimate, visceral and **[[material. For those of us at
universities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it's especially critical to think
about this, given that **[[we often conceptualize our power in the form
of abstraction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Freedom and power are given to us
in the form of imperial mobility: the ability to go where and when we
please and to do what we want to whomever we choose. And among other
more sinister things, this lends itself to rootlessness: this sense of
"shit, there's so much to be done, and I have no idea what I'm supposed
to do." So, let's move away from that abstraction towards a critical
study of what our position, specifically within this university, both
empowers us to do and therefore makes us responsible for doing. Let's
start with the fact that we here at the university are not sitting on
salvation in the form of theses and theories and capstone projects. How
ridiculous is it that the knowledge and the resources to which we have
access -- which we might like to think of as inherently revolutionary --
are directly derived, and often violently extracted, from the people who
are now denied access to them. And these are the most precarious people:
the people who are going to be the most vulnerable under Trump, those
who work two or three jobs and take on massive debts so that their
children can go learn **[["revolutionary
theories"]{.mark}]{.underline}** that function to
[**[alienate]{.mark}**]{.underline} them further from their families and
**[[communities.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Nothing is inherently
revolutionary[.]{.underline} **[[Anything that does not engage]{.mark}
[people's]{.mark} [material needs]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the service
of radically transforming the world they inhabit **[[is not
revolutionary]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Our task is to take the abstract
knowledge that we have, and weaponize it. Because sitting here, in
libraries and archives, it has no transformative value. Our job is to
steal it -- from academia, from jargon, from the confines of these halls
literally named after colonizers -- to take everything we have access to
here, and weaponize it in the service of those we love. The university
is an imperial institution. It is fundamentally counterrevolutionary.
And as Fred Moten and Stefano Harney contend: that means that the only
ethical relationship to this university is one of theft.\[i\] And that
doesn't necessarily mean one of opposition. It is our job to study and
understand what we, specifically, are positioned within this
counterrevolutionary institution to do. To ask: what are the resources,
what are the connections, what are the kinds of access -- to mobility
and security and time -- that I have here, and how might I act as a
leak, a channel, a bridge to my community, and how might I transform
these things to speak directly to their visceral, material needs.
Because **[[resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}** is fundamentally a work of
deep affirmation. Whether it's creation, whether it's reaction, whether
it **[[looks like free breakfast programs or armed
self-defense]{.mark},]{.underline}** resistance is the work of affirming
our collective rights to self-determination, to enjoying the fruits of
our own labor, to **[[avoiding premature death at the hands of the
police]{.mark};]{.underline}** it's affirming our rights to health, to
dignity, to the sanctity of our own bodies, **[[to maintaining familial
bonds across arbitrary national borders]{.mark}...!]{.underline}**
Resistance needs always to emerge out of affirmation for our
deservingness of these things. And everything we're feeling right now:
the fear, the pain, the uncertainty, the anxiety, the sadness, they
serve the purpose of illuminating for us those needs. And so part of the
work we need to do is learn to be guided by those feelings in ourselves
and in each other, and through them trace and map the violence that
produces them, so that we can develop the capacity to collectively
imagine and then create a world that is responsive to those deep,
material, visceral, intimate needs that are currently not being met. And
we are not discovering fire here. To paraphrase Dylan Rodríguez: there
is so much beautifully-imagined, well-thought-out, wildly creative work
that has been going on for years, both inside and outside of the
US.\[ii\] Much of it done to prefigure the world people desire: in the
construction of mutual aid networks, in building functioning
alternatives to the police and to unaffordable healthcare, in creating
access to childcare, to healthy food, to housing, to land rights...
People have long been building what they need, to replace what does not
serve them. And we have so much to draw from as we develop and expand
our own capacities to desire and imagine and actually create a more
livable world. Nikhil Singh recently described Republican Congressional
action as "the expansion of pathways to premature death."\[iii\] And I
think that's a really useful descriptor, in that it reminds us that what
we now face is, yes, terrifying expansion, frightening acceleration --
but we are not strangers to this violence. This violence is not strange,
and neither is resistance to it. We are not starting from square one,
and we are not alone. And in that is rooted my hope. Let's think of hope
less as a kind of optimism, and more as a kind of humility. Joy James, a
radical Black intellectual, locates hope in what she calls
"comprehension of the unity of the oppressed."\[iv\] This unity exceeds
the unbearably painful here and now, and acknowledges the struggles, the
resilience, the resistance, the existence of all those who precede us
and exceed us and will proceed us. We are not alone. And now is the time
to double down. Now is not the time for Cal-exit, for moving to Canada,
for escape -- especially for those of us with the latitude for escape,
because that means we also have access to power and leverage that those
who cannot escape do not. Now is the time to root down and critically
examine what we have the power and therefore the responsibility to do.
To be guided by everything that we're feeling, and through it to trace
and to name visceral violence, and then to build resistance that affirms
our collective rights to have our deepest needs met. And, standing on
the shoulders of giants, to think and dream and build towards a world
that we actually want to inhabit.

[Liberalism contains from its inception a generalized incitement
to]{.underline} what Nietzsche terms [ressentiment]{.underline}, the
moralizing revenge of the powerless,\"the triumph of the weak as weak.
\"22 This incitement to ressentiment inheres in two related constitutive
paradoxes of liberalism: that between individual liberty and social
egalitarianism, a paradox which produces failure turned to recrimination
by the subordinated, and guilt turned to resentment by the
\"successful\"; and that between the individualism that legitimates
liberalism and the cultural homogeneity required by its commitment to
political universality, a paradox which stimulates the articulation of
politically significant differences on the one hand, and the suppression
of them on the other, and which offers a form of articulation that
presses against the limits of universalist discourse even while that
which is being articulated seeks to be harbored withinincluded inthe
terms of that universalism. [Premising itself on the natural equality of
human beings, [liberalism makes a]{.mark} political [promise of
universal individual freedom in order to arrive at social
equality]{.mark}, or achieve a civilized retrieval of the equality
postulated in the state of nature.]{.underline} It is the tension
between the promises of individualistic liberty and the requisites of
equality that yields ressentiment in one of two directions, depending on
the way in which the paradox is brokered. A strong commitment to freedom
vitiates the fulfillment of the equality promise and breeds ressentiment
as welfare state liberalism \-\-- attenuations of the unmitigated
license of the rich and powerful on behalf of the \"disadvantaged.\"
Conversely, a strong commitment to equality, requiring heavy state
interventionism and economic redistribution, attenuates the commitment
to freedom and breeds ressentiment expressed as neoconservative
antistatism, racism, charges of reverse racism, and so forth. [However,
it is not only the tension between freedom and equality but [the prior
presumption of the]{.mark} self-reliant and [self-made capacities of
liberal subjects, conjoined with their unavowed dependence on]{.mark}
and construction by a variety of [social relations]{.mark} and forces,
that [makes all liberal subjects]{.mark}, and not only markedly
disenfranchised ones, [vulnerable to ressentiment]{.mark}: it is [their
situatedness within power]{.mark}, their production by power,
[and]{.mark} liberal discourse\'s [denial of this situatedness]{.mark}
and production that [cast the liberal subject into failure]{.mark}, the
failure [to make itself in the context of a discourse in which its
selfmaking is assumed]{.mark}, indeed, is its assumed nature. [This
failure]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Nietzsche calls suffering, [must
either find a reason within itself (which redoubles the failure) or a
site of external blame upon which to avenge its hurt and redistribute
its pain. Here is]{.underline} Nietzsche\'s account of this moment in
the production of [ressentiment: For [every sufferer]{.mark}
instinctively [seeks a cause for]{.mark}]{.underline} his [[\[their\]
suffering]{.mark}, more exactly, an agent]{.underline}; still more
specifically, a guilty agent who is susceptible to suffering in short,
some living thing upon which he can, on some pretext or other, vent his
affects, actually or in effigy . . . . This \... constitutes the actual
physiological cause of ressentiment, vengefulness, and the like: a
desire to deaden pain by means of affects, . . . to deaden, by means of
a more violent emotion of any kind, a tormenting, secret pain that is
becoming unendurable, and to drive it out of consciousness at least for
the moment: for that one requires an affect, as savage an affect as
possible, and, in order to excite that, any pretext at all.
[Ressentiment in this context is a triple achievement: [it produces an
affect]{.mark} (rage, righteousness) [that overwhelms the hurt; it
produces a culprit responsible for the hurt; and it produces a site of
revenge to displace the hurt]{.mark} (a place to inflict hurt as the
sufferer has been hurt). Together these operations both
ameliorate]{.underline} (in Nietzsche\'s term, \"anaesthetize\") [and
externalize what is otherwise \"unendurable.\"]{.underline}

## COMMODIFICATION 

#### Commodification DA: The aff commodifies the suffering of black people in exchange for your ballot in the debate economy\-\--playing a game where we move scenarios of suffering around like chess pieces for our own personal enjoyment is the most unethical form of intellectual imperialism.

**Baudrillard 94** \[Jean, "The Illusion of the End" p. 66-71\]

We have long denounced the capitalistic, economic exploitation of the
poverty of the \'other half of the world\' \[\[\'autre monde\]. [[We
must]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[denounce]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[moral and sentimental [exploitation of]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[poverty]{.underline}** - [**[charity cannibalism]{.underline}**
[being **worse than oppressive violence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
**extraction** and **humanitarian reprocessing** of a
[destitution]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[has become the
equivalent]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[oil deposits]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[gold mines]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The extortion
of the spectacle of poverty and]{.underline}, at the same time, of
**[our charitable condescension]{.underline}**: [a]{.underline}
worldwide appreciated [surplus of fine sentiments and bad
conscience]{.underline}. We should, in fact, see this not as the
extraction of raw materials, but as a waste-reprocessing enterprise.
Their destitution and our bad conscience are, in effect, all part of the
waste-products of history- the main thing is to recycle them to produce
a new energy source.¶ We have here an escalation in the psychological
balance of terror. World [capitalist oppression is]{.underline} now
merely [the vehicle]{.underline} and alibi [for this]{.underline} other,
**[much more ferocious]{.underline}**, [form of moral
predation]{.underline}. One might almost say, contrary to the Marxist
analysis, that [[**material exploitation** is only there to
extract]{.mark} that **[spiritual raw material]{.mark}** that is [the
**misery of peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which [serves

rich countries and [media]{.mark} nourishment for our daily
lives]{.underline}**. The \'Fourth World\' (we are no longer dealing
with a \'developing\' Third World) is once again beleaguered, this time
as a catastrophe-bearing stratum. [The West is whitewashed in the
reprocessing of the rest of the world as waste and residue.]{.underline}
And the white world repents and seeks absolution - it, too, the
waste-product of its own history.¶ The South is a natural producer of
raw materials, the latest of which is catastrophe. [The

people\'s destitution]{.underline}** [becomes]{.underline} **[our
adventure playground]{.underline}** . Thus, [the]{.underline}
**[humanitarian offensive]{.underline}** aimed at the Kurds - a show of
repentance on the part of the Western powers after allowing Saddam
Hussein to crush them - [is]{.underline} in reality merely
[the]{.underline} **[second phase of the war]{.underline}**, a phase [in
which charitable intervention finishes off the work of
extermination]{.underline}. **[We are the consumers of the ever
delightful spectacle of poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving
spectacle of our own efforts to alleviate it]{.underline}** **[(which,
in fact, merely function to secure the conditions of reproduction of the
catastrophe market]{.underline}** ); there, at least, in the order of
moral profits, the Marxist analysis is wholly applicable: [we see to it
that extreme poverty is reproduced as a symbolic deposit, as **a fuel
essential to the moral and sentimental equilibrium** of the
West.¶]{.underline} In our defence, it might be said that this extreme
poverty was largely of our own making and it is therefore normal that we
should profit by it. There can be no finer proof that the distress of
the rest of the world is at the root of Western power and that the
spectacle of that distress is its crowning glory than the inauguration,
on the roof of the Arche de la Defense, with a sumptuous buffet laid on
by the Fondation des Droits de l\'homme, of an exhibition of the finest
photos of world poverty. Should we be surprised that spaces are set
aside in the Arche d\' Alliance. for universal suffering hallowed by
caviar and champagne? Just as the economic crisis of the West will not
be complete so long as it can still exploit the resources of the rest of
the world, so [the symbolic crisis will be complete only when it is no
longer able to feed on the other half\'s human and natural
catastrophes]{.underline} (Eastern Europe, the Gulf, the Kurds,
Bangladesh, etc.). [We need this drug, which serves us as an aphrodisiac
and hallucinogen]{.underline}. And [the poor]{.underline} countries
**[are the best suppliers]{.underline}** - as, indeed, they are of other
drugs. We provide them, through our media, with the means to exploit
this paradoxical resource, just as we give them the means to exhaust
their natural resources with our technologies. **[[Our whole culture
lives off this catastrophic cannibalism,]{.mark}]{.underline}** relayed
in cynical mode by the news media, and carried forward in moral mode by
our humanitarian aid, which is a way of encouraging it and ensuring its
continuity, just as economic aid is a strategy for perpetuating
under-development. Up to now, the financial sacrifice has been
compensated a hundredfold by the moral gain. But when the catastrophe
market itself reaches crisis point, in accordance with the implacable
logic of the market, when distress becomes scarce or the marginal
returns on it fall from overexploitation, when we run out of disasters
from elsewhere or when they can no longer be traded like coffee or other
commodities, the West will be forced to produce its own catastrophe for
itself , in order to meet its need for spectacle and that voracious
appetite for symbols which characterizes it even more than its voracious
appetite for food. It will reach the point where it devours itself. When
we have finished sucking out the destiny of others, we shall have to
invent one for ourselves. The Great Crash, the symbolic crash, will come
in the end from us Westerners, but only when we are no longer able to
feed on the hallucinogenic misery which comes to us from the other half
of the world.¶ Yet they do not seem keen to give up their monopoly. The
Middle East, Bangladesh, black Africa and Latin America are really going
flat out in the distress and catastrophe stakes, and thus in providing
symbolic nourishment for the rich world. They might be said to be
overdoing it: heaping earthquakes, floods, famines and ecological
disasters one upon another, and finding the means to massacre each other
most of the time. [**[The \'disaster show\' goes on]{.mark}** without
any let-up and our sacrificial debt to them far exceeds their economic
debt]{.underline}. The misery with which they generously overwhelm us is
something we shall never be able to repay. **[The [sacrifices we offer
in return are laughable]{.mark}]{.underline}** (a tornado or two, **[[a
few tiny]{.mark}]{.underline}** holocausts on the
**[[roads]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the odd financial sacrifice) and,
moreover, by some infernal logic, these work out as much greater gains
for us, whereas our kindnesses have merely added to the natural
catastrophes another one immeasurably worse: the demographic
catastrophe, a veritable epidemic which we deplore each day in pictures.

**Performance is invested in the creation of a cultivated self collapses
that politics into ethics, reifies privatization and misunderstands
powers' exertion through difference.**

**McNay '09** (Lois, Lecturer in Politics and Fellow of Somerville
College, Oxford, "Self as Enterprise: Dilemmas of Control and Resistance

P. 67-68)

A possible objection is that **[it would be incorrect to interpret
Foucault's idea of an [ethics of the self]{.mark} as offering an account
of oppositional political agency]{.underline}**. Certainly, Foucault
repeatedly states that the idea is not intended to provide a blueprint
for political action. **[It merely outlines a set of ethical
predispositions that provide a crucial precondition for democratic
practices but [have no]{.mark} particular [entailments for an account of
political action]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Such a strict demarcation of
the ethical from the political seems untenable, however, in the light of
the connections Foucault establishes between a critical ontology of the
self and emancipation. On any reading of Foucault's descriptions of an
ethics of the self, it is clear that **[he did not envisage it as a
solipsistic exercise but rather as a multifaceted form of 'practical
critique' whose subversive effects are felt in many domains of social
practice:]{.underline}** 'the political, ethical, social, philosophical
problem of our days is . . . to liberate us both from the state and from
the type of individualization which is linked to the state' (Foucault,
1982: 216). He frequently describes the idea of an ethics of the self in
the politicized terms of a 'liberation', a 'struggle', a 'refusal' and,
on several occasions, explicitly compares its methods and aims with
political movements such as feminism (Foucault, 1984b: 46--7).6 Given
this, **[it is difficult to see how a critical social ontology oriented
to the 'intransigence of freedom' can be anything other than a fully
political project. On this politicized reading of ethics of the self, it
becomes reasonable to ask to what extent it represents a plausible basis
for an oppositional political agency,]{.underline}** especially in the
light of Foucault's powerful analysis of the disciplinary restructuring
of self as enterprise. If the later work is read through the problematic
of the earlier lectures, **[[there seems to be a fundamental mismatch
between the analytics of biopower and the idea of ethical
self-formation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To put it bluntly, [[how can an
individualized process of ethical self-formation have sufficient
resources to present a serious challenge to]{.mark}, or refusal of, a
form of [power that operates precisely through the proliferation of
difference and the management of individual
autonomy**?**]{.mark}]{.underline} **[Foucault's desire to locate
political opposition at the level of an individual practice
stems]{.underline}**, famously, **[from his]{.underline}**
well-documented **[antipathy to Marxist and other collective plans for
political action]{.underline}**. But 25 years on,
**[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the fragmenting effects of
**[[neoliberal governance deeply entrenched]{.underline}]{.mark}**
within the fabric of many Western democracies, [[it is questionable
whether an ethics of self can withstand co-optation into the flexible,
depoliticizing spirit of capitalism]{.underline}**.** **[As Myers puts
it]{.underline}**:]{.mark} 'although Foucault labels the activity of
self-constitution a "practice of freedom" . . . **[[techniques of
self-care are inadequate instruments for confronting the specifically
depoliticizing effects of discipline and biopower, which concern the
configuration of plurality']{.underline}]{.mark}** (2008: 135). As a
model of political action, **[an [individual ethics of the self appears
to be]{.mark} relatively [ineffective because its]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[radical energies seem too vulnerable to reprivatization by the
assimilating force of the self as enterprise]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Against this, it is possible to argue that ethics of the self is not
only intended to be an individualized self-relation but may also denote
a widespread ethos of openness to alterity intended to ground collective
democratic practices.7 Even on this reading, however,
**[the]{.underline}** same **[[explanatory gaps remain as to how a
generalized structure of feeling has sufficient force to amount to a
'refusal']{.mark} [of]{.mark} a pervasive and [depoliticizing form of
social organization]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Missing is any
indication of how a]{.underline}**]{.mark} relatively **[[loose and
indeterminate ethos]{.mark} located in everyday life [can be mediated
into more durable and directed practices so as to constitute part of a
concerted 'struggle']{.mark} against neoliberal
governance]{.underline}**. Indeed, against the claim that it is too
demanding to interpret ethics of the self as an account of political
agency, it is possible to counter that **[[Foucault]{.mark}
problematically [collapses politics back to ethics]{.mark} [in so far as
the contestatory force attributed to practices of self-formation is
asserted rather than justified]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In short,
**[[there is a]{.mark} [troubling political quietism]{.mark} in the idea
of ethics of the self [which]{.mark} considerably [weakens]{.mark} [its
counter-hegemonic potential]{.mark} vis-à-vis the disruption of
neoliberal governance of the self.]{.underline}**

#### The mediated experience is affective to the purpose of their politics. It only insights psychic violence.

SUFFERING AND THE VISION OF A COSMOPOLITAN PUBLIC        Lilie
Chouliaraki is a professor in Media and Communications at the London
School of Economics and Political Sciences   \]

In the 'celebration of communitarianism' version of global
connectivity,   television introduces the spectator into a broad
community of fellow‐spectators simply by engaging him/her in the act of
simultaneous viewing. This argument, present in McLuhan's early idea of
the 'global village' (1964) as well as in current accounts of mediation,
claims that television establishes a spectatorial 'feeling in common'
based more on the activity of viewing and less on the content of the
spectacle itself. Television, Eco says, speaks less and less of the
exterior world...it speaks of itself and of the context it establishes
with its audience (Eco 1985 in Maffesoli 1996:66). This self‐referential
quality of television evidently comes about from the capacity of the
medium to have us all watching the same images at the same time.   [Yet,
there is deep pessimism in this line of thinkingiii. [Whereas images  
bring spectators together in new forms of sociality, the questions of
what these images show or how their content may affect the spectator
remain unaccounted for]{.mark}. This is because it is not the
connectivity to the spectacle on screen that counts as the purpose of
mediated experience, but the connectivity to fellow spectators iv. Such
[connectivity, however, not only separates the spectator's zone of
comfort from the zone of suffering as two worlds that never meet, but it
also deprives the world of suffering of its dramatic urgency and moral
appealv.]{.mark} What this view of mediation as tele‐sociality
ultimately misses out is an orientation towards the distant
other]{.underline}. Closely connected to this view is the argument about
**[compassion fatigue. [Compassion fatigue takes its point of departure
in the spectator's everyday life under conditions of safety and comfort
and accuses television of over‐burdening spectators with news of]{.mark}
human pain and [misfortune]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This overdose of
misery, the argument has it, renders suffering banal, unimportant and
irrelevant to the spectator's lifeworld; each piece of news on suffering
is yet another story that reaches our screen only to disappear in
oblivion as soon as we zap to another channelvi.    [In the
'democratization of responsibility' version of global connectivity, on
the contrary, television news from around the world increases the
spectator's concern for the misfortune of the distant sufferer. [Taking
its point of departure in the reflexive organisation of the self in late
modernity, this optimistic argument begs the question of how our
mediated experience can translate into political deliberation and public
action]{.mark}vii]{.underline}. The constant flow of images on screen,
the argument has it, inevitably opens up the local world of the
spectator to non‐local realities and enables the reflexive process by
which the spectator comes to recognise such realities as a potential
domain of his/her own action. It is the interplay between the visibility
of the sufferer and the reflexive response of the spectator to his/her
suffering that contains here the promise of
cosmopolitanismviii.  [Despite its forceful rhetoric, however, this
optimistic version proposes no specific perspectives as to how such
forms of publicness may be realized. Rather than asking how exactly the
image of the sufferer may lead to effective action[, the
'democratization of responsibility' argument ultimately turns to wishful
thinking.]{.mark}]{.underline} Audiences, we are told, must turn their
sense of responsibility into a form of moral‐practical reflection
because this is the best‐ the only option we have (Thompson 1995:265).
The dream of cosmopolitanism is asserted but the question of how we get
there is essentially ignored. To sum up, the two versions of global
connectivity that I reviewed here   understand cosmopolitanism as the
formation of a certain relationship between the spectator and the
distant other. Whereas in 'celebration of communitarianism', this
relationship connects the safe spectator with other safe spectators at
the expense of recognising the moral demand that the spectacle of
distant sufferers may press on us, in 'democratisation of
responsibility'[, [this relationship does entail a sense of
responsibility towards distant sufferers but cannot tell us how we can
move from simply watching to actually caring for those
sufferers]{.underline}]{.mark}. The paradox of technology seems to haunt
both optimistic arguments on mediation: technology connects, but how and
who connects with whom remain unaccounted for. [Can we overcome this
paradox in order to understand just how mediation may shape
beyond‐the‐nation forms of connectivity and how it may offer the
possibility of a cosmopolitan public?  ]{.underline}

## RECOGNITION

#### A politics of recognition/representation only reifies negative stereotypes and encourages separatism amongst marginalized groups. 

**Nancy Fraser 2000,** **(MAY/JUNE 2000. Nancy Fraser is an American
critical theorist, feminist, and the Henry A. and Louise Loeb Professor
of Political and Social Science and professor of philosophy at The New
School in New York City. "Rethinking
Recognition"**[https://newleftreview.org/issues/II3/articles/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition]{.underline}**)**

Displacement, however, is not the only problem: [the identity politics
model of recognition tends also to reify identity. Stressing the need to
elaborate and display an authentic, self-affirming and self-generated
collective identity, it puts moral pressure on individual members to
conform to a given group culture. Cultural dissidence and
experimentation are accordingly discouraged, when they are not simply
equated with disloyalty.]{.underline} [So, too, is cultural criticism,
including efforts to explore intragroup divisions, such as those of
gender, sexuality and class.]{.underline} Thus, far from welcoming
scrutiny of, for example, the patriarchal strands within a subordinated
culture, the tendency of the identity model is to brand such critique as
'inauthentic'. [The overall effect is to impose a single, drastically
simplified group-identity which denies the complexity of people's lives,
the multiplicity of their identifications and the cross-pulls of their
various affiliations. Ironically, then, the identity model serves as a
vehicle for misrecognition: in reifying group identity, it ends by
obscuring the politics of cultural identification, the struggles within
the group for the authority---and the power---to represent
it.]{.underline} By shielding such struggles from view, this approach
masks the power of dominant fractions and reinforces intragroup
domination. The identity model thus lends itself all too easily to
repressive forms of communitarianism, promoting conformism, intolerance
and patriarchalism. Paradoxically, moreover, the identity model tends to
deny its own Hegelian premisses[. Having begun by assuming that identity
is dialogical, constructed via interaction with another subject, it ends
by valorizing monologism---supposing that misrecognized people can and
should construct their identity on their own.]{.underline} It supposes,
further, that a group has the right to be understood solely in its own
terms---that no one is ever justified in viewing another subject from an
external perspective or in dissenting from another's
self-interpretation. But again, this runs counter to the dialogical
view, making cultural identity an auto-generated auto-description, which
one presents to others as an obiter dictum. [Seeking to exempt
'authentic' collective self-representations from all possible challenges
in the public sphere, this sort of identity politics scarcely fosters
social interaction across differences: on the contrary, it encourages
separatism and group enclaves.]{.underline}

Nurturing Collective Forms of Identity¶ We believe that before you go
out into the community and make change, you have to really understand
where you're coming from and understand yourself. This is about identity
development, the history of your people, where your people stand in the
bigger picture. ¶ ---Staffer at CAPAY (Coalition for Asian Pacific
American Youth), in Boston, Massachusetts¶ As evidenced by this quote,
civic **[[activism organizations focus on raising
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}** and strengthening individuals' ability
to navigate and negotiate the challenges they face. In doing so, they
[**[seek to "make the personal political" among youth from marginalized
social groups]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Civic activism organizations recruit youth from
marginalized ethnic, racial, or cultural groups; within our study, there
were organizations focused explicitly on African American, Native
American, Asian American, and gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and
questioning (GLBTQ) identity. There were other organizations that
coalesced around larger identity categories, such as youth of color.¶ We
found that there was a clearly defined need for identity support among
the young people within these organizations. Youth we interviewed
described that before joining these groups they had a poor view of
themselves, had been ignorant about their history, and/or had been
involved in self-destructive behaviors. For instance, as one youth
explained, "When I first realized I was queer I felt really powerless
and really scared of myself. And that was really scary; to be scared of
who you are is totally diminishing." Other youth said that they "didn't
know there were so many different kinds of Asians," "didn't know about
self-hatred," or didn't "understand what really happened in the civil
rights movement; schools didn't really give you more than the basics."
The need for identity affirmation, therefore, within these youth
populations was particularly strong**[[. It is
important]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, to point out
[**[that]{.mark}**]{.underline} civic activism [**[organizations moved
beyond mere identity affirmation, gearing their
work]{.mark}**]{.underline} in such a way as it set the groundwork
**[[for a]{.mark} [broader social justice
orientation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ Most organizations offered
"critical education" on prejudice and discrimination as an entry point
for social justice issues in order to help youth understand \[end page
26\] the legacy of oppression and identify present-day challenges facing
their identity group. One organization, for example, believed that the
barriers faced by African American youth are best addressed once youth
have considered the legacy and impact of their own history, including
the painful scars left by slavery and segregation. They encouraged youth
to reflect on and "heal" these scars so that they could transcend
internalized racism and learn to effectively function in society. This
approach is consistent with Watts et al.'s argument that African
Americans benefit from an understanding of the social structure of power
and privilege. In their struggle against oppression, African Americans
can "benefit from a strong sense of self that incorporates both the
cultural and sociopolitical aspects of their African American heritage"
(2003, p. 188).¶ Civic activism organizations move beyond the
exploration of the history of particular identity groups, seeking to
emancipate youth through a process of deep critical analysis and
reflection. Some organizations are intentional about pushing youth out
of their "comfort zone" by asking that they interrogate their
assumptions about themselves, each other, and about the society around
them. One youth captured this aspect of this approach when he said,¶ I
don't think it's about being comfortable all the time. It's about
learning different circumstances that make you uncomfortable, where you
have to stand up for what you say, even if it's not the majority
opinion. It's about getting over the discomfort you feel.¶ Thus, youth
within these organizations are pushed to extend their thinking, to
confront their own biases, and to ask hard questions of the leaders
within their communities. Further, they analyze issues of oppression and
consider how their own personal experiences relate to the struggles of
others within and outside of their own community. This kind of identity
support, in turn, creates a sense of purpose in young people to take a
civic activist stance and to work with others in their communities to
end various forms of oppression.¶ Making Social Change Tangible¶ Social
change happens at the personal level, at the gut level, and has to come
out of self-interest. People mobilize because their daughter has asthma
and they need to do something about it.¶ ---Staffer at 21st Century
Youth Leadership Movement, in Selma, Alabama¶ As captured by this quote,
[**[the desire for social change is often rooted in personal needs and
experiences]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and as such, connection to
collective forms of identity can be a precursor to social action. [Civic
**[activism]{.underline}**]{.mark}[,]{.underline} however, also \[end
page 27\] [**[depends on]{.mark}** **[the identification of tangible
goals for social change]{.mark}**,]{.underline} an articulation of [[**a
coherent strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark} for reaching those goals, and a
belief in the power and efficacy of groups of people **[[to effect
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.¶ Further, we have found that the social
change goals or "wins" that civic activism groups use to measure their
own progress are, by design, incremental so that youth can remain
engaged in the process. These include press coverage of their issues,
the number of people they recruit to attend rallies or events, and the
number of meetings they hold with people in power. Over the course of
the study, civic activism groups achieved some relatively large-scale
community wins. These include one organization's success in closing down
a cement plant in their community, another's successful defeat of a city
council measure to create a daytime curfew for teens, and a third
organization's successful effort to have a sexual harrassment policy
created for their school district. These types of victories fueled young
people's sense of purpose and their belief that they could make a
difference. The following quote from one youth is illustrative of the
sense of enthusiasm and competence that young people within these groups
radiated.¶ We have a big voice. There aren't a lot of other youth who
are as involved as we are\.... But, we're at the point now where we are
taken seriously. We earned their respect by the actions we take. When we
were opposing the cement plant, the owner challenged us at a city
council meeting. He told us to be more "productive." So, we went out and
got 1,000 sig- natures opposing his plant and that shut him up and
impressed the city council people.¶ Civic activism groups use a variety
of strategies to build the capacity of youth leaders to effect change[[.
**One of most**]{.mark} **[universal and potent]{.mark}**]{.underline}
strategies used by organizing groups [**[is political education.
This]{.mark}**]{.underline} approach [**[enables youth to learn about
social movements]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., the civil rights
movement), [**[political processes]{.mark}** (]{.underline}the electoral
process[) **[and current events]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., racial
profiling and the effects of 9/11 on immigrant communities). Through
political education, youth organizing groups hope to support
critical-thinking skills and develop values and attitudes that move
youth to act against injustice. Political education sessions often seek
to make connections between larger social issues and young people's
day-to-day lives, and center on such issues as policing, school quality,
environmental justice, and immigrants' rights. On one level, youth are
seen as experts on these issues, and they are encouraged to share their
experiences as well as compose and defend their own opinions. On another
level, youth are pressed by program leaders to think about these issues
abstractly, on a scale beyond their individual experience, including a
consideration of the international or global characteristics of power
and oppression.¶ From a base of political education, civic activism
groups have progressed toward the development of a clear and manageable
community-change \[end page 28\] agenda. They have sought, at the most
basic level, to empower youth to take leadership on issues in their
lives, emphasizing their role as grassroots leaders within their
communities. The first step in that process is to identify the issues
most salient to the youth who participate in the organization. The
second step is to ask youth to actively seek out the perspectives and
concerns of other community members, in an effort to find issues of
broad concern that can serve as the basis for sizable coalitions and
collective action. Thus, the issues that civic activist groups address
are reflective of issues that community members face. The process of
listening to and raising awareness about such issues is seen as a high
priority in and of itself. Issues identified as most relevant to youth
and their communities include the lack of recreational spaces, lack of
green spaces, environmental pollution, sexual harrassment in schools,
policing and the increased incarceration of youth offenders, and unfair
working conditions.¶ Coaching Strategies for Fostering Lifelong
Activism¶ **[[Without]{.mark}]{.underline}** grounding youth in the
larger sociohistorical context of social movements and introducing them
to **[[concrete strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}** for social change,
impassioned [[**youth** **would be at a loss to translate their
ideas**]{.mark}]{.underline} and beliefs [**[into
action]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Civic activism groups use a variety of
mechanisms or levers ("direct actions") for change, including education,
letter-writing campaigns, petitions, public presentations, meetings with
people in power, protests, and boycotts. In taking such approaches to
civic engagement, youth activism groups dispel some of the stereotypes
that characterize their work as "oppositional." They emphasize the need
to work within the system to the extent possible (i.e., through
participation in decision-making bodies), while always being prepared to
apply pressure from outside the system (i.e., through protests and
boycotts). In the words of one program director, "We're clear that being
in the system or out isn't important. It's a strategy that's rooted in
systems change that is important." Further, civic activism groups
embrace a philosophy of nonviolent and peaceful activism; they are
concerned that youth develop a social justice orientation that is
positive and affirming, because they believe that this is necessary to
sustain social action in the long run. The following quote, by a staff
member at one organization, speaks to this issue:¶ We don't organize out
of hate, but out of love---our love for people. Because hate is very
defeating, and can motivate and charge you to do something about
injustices. But \[we ask youth\], how long is your hate going to sustain
your commitment to social justice?¶ Hence, these organizations promote
spiritual and/or human rights arguments for social justice. In doing so,
they seek to strike a delicate balance, supporting young people's
ability and opportunity to actively question authority while at the same
time enabling youth to resist cynicism that could potentially lead to
social distrust and/or alienation

Reza vigorously labors to keep his body taut and groomed and confined or
to keep his matter in place because his, too, is not a hardened
body-*cum*-container of difference inaugurated by Enlightenment
humanism: an epistemic break tasked with measuring the progress of
Europe\'s and not a universal or generic Man. [Michelle Ann Stephens
elaborates:]{.underline} Gradually over the course of the Enlightenment,
as **[[the skin and the body both begin to harden]{.mark} and be seen as
less and less permeable]{.underline}**, the tying of difference to the
epidermal and physiognomic also hardens the bodily surface as an
impermeable container of difference. [[This]{.mark} hardening then
[contributes to]{.mark} an understanding of [physiognomic difference as
the marker of fundamental differences]{.mark} with the
species.[^\[17\]^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-17)]{.underline}
\[5\] Enlightenment modernity replaces anatomical human differences with
physiognomic ones to henceforth classify the human body as a duality of
insides and outsides in which [[material skin
signifies]{.underline}]{.mark} the spatialization of time, for example,
in [[racial schemas]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[6\] If [[the \"paradigmatic
trope of that body left behind\" by Enlightenment lore is flesh
\"stripped of its imaginary reflections and symbolic
meanings,]{.mark}\"]{.underline} characterized instead by orifices and
excrescences, always already black or \"a threshold or meeting point of
human
contact,\"[^[\[18\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-18)
then Reza\'s sexual preference for whiter whites is especially relevant
in the homosexual instance because \"the phallus *is* white
skin.\"[^[\[19\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-19)
Stated another way, the phallus doubly indicts sociogeny and not
ontogeny as the source of white libidinal persuasions. Lewis Gordon
explains, Consider the white man. Being pure Presence, he is equated
with manliness *in toto.* The manly, or masculine, is in fact a figure
of denial, a being who attempts to close all its holes and become pure,
sealed flesh in search of holes. From the perspective of such a being,
all holes are elsewhere; he doesn\'t even have an anus; when he kisses,
nothing enters his mouth---he enters the Other\'s. In his presence,
[[the black becomes a chasm to fill]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} [the
black \'man\' is a *hole*]{.underline}]{.mark}*.* \...\[The penis\]
protrudes. It pretends not to be a hole, but instead, a filler-of-holes.
\...As pure Presence, masculinity is an ideal form of whiteness with its
own gradations; the less of a hole one \'is,\' the more masculine one
is; the less dark, the more white. The black man would therefore have
the propensity to become slimy if it were not for the fact that he
embodies femininity even more than the white woman. His skin, his eyes,
his nose, his ears, his mouth, his anus, his penis ooze out his
femininity like blood from a splattered body. He faces the possibility
of denying his feminine situation: [a [black man in the presence of
whiteness stands as a hole to be filled]{.mark}]{.underline}; he stands
to the white man in a homoerotic situation and to the white woman in a
heterosexual erotic situation with a homoerotic twist; she becomes the
white/male that fills his blackness/femininity. \[7\] Interracial
meetings of invaginated flesh and phallic skin stimulate a sexuality of
the surfaces in which human recognition and value, epidermalized because
\"we are used to thinking of the skin, the surface of the body, as the
baseline for what it means to be human,\" are
bartered.[^[\[21\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-21)\[8\]
In *Deleuze and Guattari: An Introduction to the Politics of Desire*
(Sage Publications, 1996),Philip Goodchild elaborates the distinction
between high, low and surface experiences of sexual pleasure. Deleuze
and Guattari characterize a \"sexuality of the depths\" as lustful,
carnal and fetishistic; \"deep\" sexualities contrast with \"high\"
sexualities because the latter \"aims to re-create the moral ideals of
the Oedipal family or the subjectified
couple,[^[\[22\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-22)

expectation]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"[^[\[23\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-23)
Notably, both are heteronormative fantasies and tautologically [[fail to

radically disorganizes the self]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [making the parts

re-sedimentation.[^[\[24\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-24)
Sexton recommends a \"sexuality of the surfaces\" instead that is
\"critical but not utopian, planned but not programmatic, indeterminate

A sexuality of [[surface disturbances]{.underline}]{.mark} responds to
what Lauren Berlant describes as \"the sociality of the world, its
hiccups and inconsistencies,\" which \"are maddening\" and demand
\"\[surface\] room to move,\" in other words, to endlessly rearrange
themselves.[^[\[26\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-26)
These exchanges [\[[aim\] at the constitution of plateaus of
intensities]{.underline}]{.mark}---a continuous, self-vibrating region
avoiding any orientation toward a culminating point or external end.
Such a sexuality continually enfolds its intensities into every
movement, word, and touch[: its [aim is to isolate]{.mark} the event of
sexuality as a [phantasm]{.mark} that subsists in every moment,
\"saturating every atom,\" without this phantasm being actualized in an
exchange of bodies or promises. Indeed, every desire is initially of
this nature,]{.underline} before being caught up in the depths of bodies
or withdrawing into the ideal
heights.[^[\[27\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-27)
The sexuality of surfaces operates through perversion. \...One surface
is always substituted for another---the search for the phantasm yields
something else of a different nature as its result, but this result can
be made into a new object of desire, producing new phantasms,
maintaining the plateau of
intensity.[^[\[28\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-28)

Morrison,[^[\[29\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-29)
I account here for a more general economy of skin and flesh---of surface
topographies---to [[enumerate the process by which]{.underline} [an
antiblack libido]{.underline} [governs]{.underline}]{.mark} the law of
attraction for nonblack persons of color. This work elaborates what
Stephens describes as \"[[the tension between the skin as an object of
the distancing, racialized gaze]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [[and the flesh
as a]{.mark} haptic \"[site for registering relational]{.mark} and
reversible aspects of \[\...\]
touch.\"[^\[30\]^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-30)]{.underline}
Irrespective of chronopolitical ideologies hailed by the Enlightenment,
which is why [the skin\'s [invagination as fleshy materiality makes it
possible for bodies \"\[to\] touch each other]{.mark}, \[to\] be touched
by the other, and \[to\] make themselves feel touched or \[to\] touch
themselves]{.underline};\"[^[\[31\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-31)
with \"skin-based or skin-linked knowledges have the capacity to bring
the gaze back into relation with other psychic
objects.\"[^[\[32\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-32)
What I describe as surface exchanges thus respond to an intercorporeal
drive in which \"smells, sights, \[and\] impressions of the body\'s
volume and size are not just scopic; they are tactile and
multisensorial.\"[[^\[33\]^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-33)\[10\]
Stephens cites Merleau-Ponty in her study of]{.underline} [[black
performance cultures]{.underline}]{.mark} [to [position \"the touch and
the gaze as interacting in a reversible, reflecting relationship to each
other]{.mark}\...a \'double and crossed situating of the visible in the
tangible and of the tangible in the visible]{.underline};\'\" but she
leans on Fanon, whose epidermal and historical-*racial* schemas counter
Merleau-Ponty\'s corporeal schema, to clarify that \"[[the
intercorporeal drive]{.mark} seeks to touch (upon) the sensational
body,]{.underline}\" or *the \'I\' that feels,* \"rather than the body
constructed by the signifier,\" or *the \'I\' that
is*.[^[\[34\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-34)
Which is to say, her study intervenes in the chronopolitical if
arbitrary distinction between sensational flesh and signifying skin; she
begins from a black new materialist perspective that \"the outline of
the skin is not felt as a smooth and straight surface\" confining matter
in place, because \"there are no sharp borderlines between the outside
world and the
body.\"[^[\[35\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-35)
I shift the ground of Stephens\' intervention slightly to argue that
interracial sex acts [[function as]{.underline} [masochistic exchanges
in which]{.underline}]{.mark} [[participants of color martyr the
black]{.mark} or brown [*\'I\' that is* to clear surface room for the
sentient and white *\'I\' that feels*]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scholars in
queer theory\'s anti-social school cite Lacan and Oedipal psychoanalysis
to read masochism as the consequence of a death drive; Fanon, however,
suggests that [[the ego\'s defeat]{.underline}]{.mark} in masochistic
sex acts, which as \"destabilizing episodes \[\...\] [[suspend the
effects of relentless negation]{.mark} so that we can look at them
[and]{.mark} reshape not only what concepts we can derive from them but
how we, bodily, sensually, can *occupy* them]{.underline},\" might also
or alternatively satisfy a life
drive.[^\[36\]^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-36)
[Masochistic sex acts [dissolve the body-ego in passing moments of
*jouissance*]{.mark}, making room for the psychic-ego to territorialize
the \"dense\" body\'s becoming-flesh]{.underline}. Surface sexualities
are feats of alchemy insofar as they engender \"changes which occur in
the feeling of our skin and of the tactile surface of our body;\" in
these exchanges, the skin\'s \"surface becomes smooth, clear, and
distinct. The tactile and the optic outlines,\" otherwise discrepant,
\"are now identical with each
other.\"[^[\[37\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-37)\[11\]
In their collaborative text, *Sex, or the Unbearable* (Duke University
Press, 2013),Berlant and Lee Edelman characterize masochistic or
\"unbearable\" sex acts as erotic meetings in which participants
abdicate personal sovereignty to invoke \"the psychic and social
incoherences and divisions, conscious and unconscious alike, that
trouble any totality or fixity of
identity.\"[^[\[38\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-38)
In the preface, which presumably the authors wrote together (although it
bears the mark of Berlant\'s epistemological investments), they describe
the project as an attempt to \"account for the disturbances and anchors
within relationality (to ourselves, across ourselves, to the world at
large) and for the effects those disturbances and anchors have on our
thinking about
sociality.\"[^[\[39\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-39)Edelman
and Berlant agree that sex constitutes a privileged site \"for
experiencing \[an\] intensified encounter with what disorganizes
accustomed ways of
being,\"[^[\[40\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-40)
and likewise, that sex uniquely asks its participants to bear an
\"unbearable encounter with the unfinished business of
being,\"[^[\[41\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-41)but
they disagree to the extent that Edelman charges Berlant with remaining
\"\'bound to the world and thus to its conditions of possibility for
undoing and
rerouting.\"[^[\[42\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-42)
Favoring instead the affective tears in social and political realities,
Edelman interprets the radical undoings of sex less as [[the subject\'s
incoherence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the face of normativity than as the
momentary access to a sense of its radical unrepresentability. Such
negative encounters, such ruptures in the logic---which is always a
*fantasy* logic---by which the subject\'s objects (itself included)
[[yield a sense of the world\'s continuity]{.underline}]{.mark} (even if
only the continuity of experiencing the world as incoherent), impose the
abruptions that Lauren \[Berlant\] calls drama and undertakes to
de-dramatize. But in my understanding of how attachment binds the
subject to the world, a tear in the fabric of attachment, and so in
reality\'s representation, cannot be separated from threat or from the
dramatics of undoing. [\...Managing affective intensities [by
recognizing]{.mark} their [status as part of the ordinary]{.mark} puts
the emphasis on a cognitive binding of the subject to the world of its
representations]{.underline}---the very binding under pressure of
undoing in the encounters to which I refer. Such transformative
self-perception achieved amid affective discontinuity implicitly
presumes a mastery of, and a capacity to include in our calculations,
our unknowable primal
attachments.[^[\[43\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-43)\[12\]
The question at the heart of Edelman\'s disagreement with Berlant is one
I seek to address by way of Fanon[: [is it possible to account for
\"ruptures in the logic \[of being\]\" provoked by unbearable sex acts
in advance of those sex acts]{.mark}, as calculation and seduction or as
a stratagem manufactured by the self\'s ego?]{.underline} Edelman
understands the ego as that which \"binds the subject to the world\" as
it is and not as it could be, disregarding the experiences of persons of
color who identify with a white ego-ideal or who wear a \"white mask\"
to neutralize or negate an epidermalized
body-ego.[^[\[44\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-44)
[These people calculate and anticipate]{.underline}, indeed, wait [for
their racial schemas to be radically undone in surface
masochisms]{.underline}.[^[\[45\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-45)
[Black persons *live* in the radically unrepresentable world Edelman
wants unbearable sex acts to make exceptional; **[the black person
knows]{.mark} instinctivel**y, as the rule of her being and not its
exception, what nonblack persons of color experience as traumatic
misrecognition and whites in possession of an uncontested corporeal
schema experience as voluntary if unbearable submission to \"cruel
optimism\"[^\[46\]^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-46)
---**[that her being is always already unfinished]{.mark}**, [in want
of]{.mark} conditions that will make ends meet.]{.underline} Unbearable
sex acts with white/r others thus function for blacks as \"an incision
into a
corpse;\"[^[\[47\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-47)
they provoke not the undoing of being [but [a momentary jolt or
animation from the dead]{.mark}, its *jouissance* testifying to what
Fanon describes as the \"white potential in every one of
us]{.underline}.\"[^[\[48\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-48)
This alternate staging complicates Edelman\'s description of erotic
submission as an encounter \"with what exceeds and undoes the subject\'s
fantasmatic sovereignty\" because to suggest that the cognitive
unbinding of unbearable sex acts animates nonsovereignty is to assume a
priori self-mastery, even if only as fantasy and
persuasion.[^[\[49\]]{.underline}^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-49)
In a correction to the Hegelian dialectic, [[Fanon argues that the white
gaze]{.mark},]{.underline} we might add, [[omnipresent in]{.mark} and as
technologies of [surveillance, discipline and self-care, makes
impossible even or especially a
being-for-self]{.mark}.[^\[50\]^](http://rhizomes.net/issue29/malaklou.html#footnote-50)]{.underline}
In other words, the \"unknowable primal attachments\" Edelman labors to
politicize by way of Lacan and Oedipal psychoanalysis are eclipsed in
Fanonian psychoanalysis by what David Marriott describes asthe ways in
which [the unconscious is constituted by the real and halts and
interrupts it: [the imagoes]{.mark} and stereotypes [by]{.mark} means of
[which the colonial subject]{.mark} hates and [enslaves itself as a
subject]{.mark}, affirms its immorality or malfeasance, and [fails to
know itself as anything but (a masked, white]{.mark})
European]{.underline}.

#### Troubling the singularity of the skin-ego through more transgression, more performativity only re-elaborates a national public interwoven with the legacy of [American exceptionalism]{.underline}. Their investment in iconicity sutures a [parasitic melodrama]{.underline} that motors racial violence in the pursuit to purge difference in the name of the representational field.

[Black iconicity serves as a site for black audiences and the nation to
gather around the **seeing of blackness.**]{.underline} However, **[[in
the focus on the singularity of the image,]{.mark} the complexity of
black lived experience and [discourses of race are
effaced.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The [image functions as abstraction, as
**decontextualized evidence** of a historical narrative that is
**constrained by normative public discourse.**]{.underline} It is a
critique that Lubiano launches against the use of images of Malcolm X
and Martin Luther King Jr. throughout Do the Right Thing. Lubiano
writes, "[[Iconography and fetishization is no]{.mark} consistent
[substitute for history and critical thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
film offers no consistent critique of 'pictures'---as icons, as
fetishes."25 Lubiano suggests that Do the Right Thing perpetuates the
unquestionable evidentiary significance of the icon in black public
culture. W. J. T. Mitchell looks at how [[iconic photographs
circulate]{.mark} throughout the film [as public art and represent a
struggle over the public sphere.]{.mark}]{.underline} This struggle in
the film takes place between Sal, the pizzeria owner whose Wall of Fame
portrays a number of famous Italian Americans, and Buggin\' Out, who
challenges him to include images of African Americans on the wall given
that the clientele is predominantly the black working-class residents of
the neighborhood. [This [investment in black iconicity is
reflective]{.mark} of black audiences and a [**national
public.**]{.mark} It is [interwoven into the]{.mark} national
**[narrative of democratic progress and American
exceptionalism]{.mark}**, [in which the children of slaves become the
**exemplars of the nation-state**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a topic pursued
in detail in chapter 1 of this study. [[The **repetition of public
outcries**,]{.mark} cautious [celebrations, **struggles over "the
image,"**]{.mark} or even tepid ambivalence [reveal the **affective
power** of]{.mark} black [**representational
practices**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [[collective responses
reinvigorate]{.underline}]{.mark} what cultural theorists call "[[the
history of the present]{.mark}."]{.underline} In theorizing affect and
the sociality of emotions, Lauren Berlant uses the phrase [["collective
attachment"]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[defines this]{.mark}]{.underline}
concept [[as a form of optimism]{.mark} in how emotions can bring
individuals together. It "is a way of [describing a]{.mark} certain
[futurism that **implies continuity with the present,**]{.mark} but, it
does not always feel good, attachment seems a better way to describe the
pleasures of repetition without presuming their affective
reverb]{.underline}." As Berlant writes, "[the public spheres are affect
worlds]{.underline}," evidenced in what Lubiano describes as the Spike
Lee discourse.26 Sara Ahmed\'s theory of affective economies is very
useful to understand the [recurrence of collective attachment to black
visual representation.]{.underline} Moving (p.11) emotion beyond
interiority (especially as conceptualized in psychoanalytic theory) to
the externalizing effects in public discourse and collective belonging,
Ahmed writes, [In such [affective economies,]{.mark} emotions do things,
and they [**align individuals with communities**]{.mark}---or bodily
space with social space---[**through the very intensity of their
attachments**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Rather than seeing emotions as
psychological dispositions, we need to consider how **[they work, in
concrete and particular ways, [to mediate the relationship between the
psychic and the social,]{.mark} and between [the individual and the
collective.]{.mark}27]{.underline}** Ahmed states that **[emotions are
not fixed or located in objects or bodies but move among objects, signs,
and bodies; "they move sideways]{.underline}** (through 'sticky'
associations between signs, figures, and objects) as well as backward
(repression always leave its trace in the present---hence 'what sticks'
is also bound up with the 'absent presence' of historicity)."28 In
reading the work of Chicano playwright Ricardo A. Bracho, José Estaban
Muñoz theorizes a method of understanding affect to attend to the ways
in which racial and ethnic groups feel and perform difference. Muñoz
writes, "In lieu of viewing racial or ethnic difference as solely
cultural, I aim to describe how [race and ethnicity can be understood as
'affective difference,' by which I mean the ways in which various
historically coherent groups 'feel' differently and **navigate the
material world on a different emotional register."**]{.underline}29 The
affective register that Muñoz references speaks to the way that **[black
cultural practices continually produce the very notion of a black
audience and the investment in this construct.]{.underline}** Inasmuch
as [the collective [attachment to black]{.mark} visual
[production]{.mark} [returns implicitly]{.mark} or unwillingly [to "the
real"]{.mark} and the compulsion to get it "right," John Jackson\'s
theory of "racial sincerity" offers insight: "Racial sincerity is [an
attempt to apply this 'something- elseness']{.mark}]{.underline}
\[referring to Ralph Ellison\'s phrase\] to race, to explain the reasons
it can feel so obvious, natural, real, and even liberating to walk
around with purportedly racial selves crammed up inside of us and
serving as invisible links to other people."30 [Jackson\'s theory allows
for the possibility to read the collective attachment that circulates
around black images and bodies in ways that are not pejorative to those
who form a sense of belonging or kinship through visual rendering of
blackness]{.underline}. Instead racial sincerity can be read as critical
responses to the psychic wound that resurfaces as failed mourning, as
"the history of the present." Through sticky association, racial
sincerity gets attached to the troubling presence of the black body in
the visual sphere. Berlant\'s, (p.12) Ahmed\'s, and Jackson\'s writings
on affect help shape the emphasis placed on critical reception and
public discourse about black visual and performative practices in this
study.

#### This form of moral masochism in the name of black life is far from anathema to the colonial relation, but only works to libidinally charge the operation of [white enjoyment]{.underline}, innocence, and racialization. In displacing the white phantasm from the bar of black aggression, cycles of [pornographic sentiment]{.underline} remain by securing a spectator-like inaction that simulates parity with black trauma, locking in structures of domination by laying passivity onto enjoyment parodying-as-self-abgenation. The aff sutures the [libido housed in guilt]{.underline} and fortifies the colonial relation of the skin-ego.

**[[Moral masochism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[characterized by]{.mark}
an [unconscious guilt]{.mark},]{.underline} [is remarkable because it
"[loosened its connection with what we recognize as
sexuality]{.mark}.]{.underline}" In saying this, Freud writes that the
primary focus in moral masochism is suffering; "Whether it is decreed by
someone who is loved or by some- one who is indifferent is of no
importance." The explicit sexuality of erotogenic and feminine
masochists is replaced by suffering. This does not mean that the
libidinal aspect disappears, however; in moral masochism, [[guilt houses
the libido]{.underline}]{.mark}. To understand this logic, one must
remember that Freud theorizes that conscience and morality are functions
of the super- ego, which develops through overcoming the Oedipus
complex. Once a child processes his or her libidinal attraction to both
parents, the parents are introjected into the ego and the child seeks
other erotic objects. [In **moral masochism**]{.underline}**, [[the ego
rather than the superego seeks punishment]{.mark} at the hands of
parental power.]{.underline}** [[This desire to be "beaten]{.mark} by
the father" [signals a resexualization of the Oedipus complex]{.mark},
which causes a regression from morality to the Oedipus
complex.]{.underline} In order to achieve the desired punishment,
"[**[the masochist must do what is inexpedient]{.mark}**, must act
against ~~his~~ their own interests, must ruin the prospects which open
out to ~~him~~ their in the real world and must, perhaps, destroy
~~his~~ their own real existence.]{.underline}" Freud writes that [[this
"turning back of sadism against the self regularly occurs where a
*cultural suppression of the instincts* holds back a large part of the
subject's destructive instinctual components from being exercised in
life]{.mark}."]{.underline} The more the masochist refrains from hurting
others, the greater his own suffering and sense of guilt become, but
this provides some plea- sure; as Freud writes, "Even the subject's
destruction of himself cannot take place without libidinal
satisfaction." In his discussion of moral masochism, Freud rekindles
masochism's relationship to pathology by focusing on the individual
masochist and his or her relationship to others. The moral masochist
wants to submit to and be punished by his or her parents (though Freud
was speaking mostly of a paternal figure). This arrangement, however, is
not realizable because it takes place in the individual's unconscious
where parents (even if living) can never actualize their roles as
punishers. According to Freud, [[the impossibility of this performance
of submission and punishment leads the masochist to consciously act out
suffering in nonsexual ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. The moral masochist
depends on society to help him or her enact suffering upon him- or
herself. Suffering, Sympathy, and Race Labeling the liberal subject
masochistic echoes Fanon's comments about the white man's masochism. As
I argued in chapter 2, this masochism is born from the guilt produced by
the white man's racism. Fanon's coding of guilt and masochism as white
offers ways to theorize the guilt of whiteness as the underside to the
work of sympathy and empathy. In [rendering the black body synonymous
with pain]{.underline}, [[white sentiment]{.underline} [and black
objectification]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[[activated]{.underline}]{.mark}. To this end, legal scholar Anthony
Farley argues that the discourse of race [is "a discourse of
pleasure-humiliation]{.underline}. In talking about race, we make
ourselves white and black---a process which produces pleasure for the
former through the humiliation of the latter." Farley argues that the
production of the suffering black body "is a process by which whites
exorcise their own demons, and is, therefore, a pleasure in itself";
[[the black body is]{.mark}]{.underline} what the white body is not, and
the ability to conceive of both is predicated on the specter of the
black body in pain. Race, then, is a social phenomenon [[born out of the
"pleasure of comparison]{.underline},]{.mark}" a pleasure that Farley,
channeling the Marquis de Sade, describes as "[[born of the sight of
wretched persons]{.underline}]{.mark}." Race is about power and
sentiment. Farley's invocation of Sade is unexpected, but it speaks to a
way of understanding racialization as a process not only of Othering but
of cruelty. However, Sade's presence is significant for another reason.
It further emphasizes our ability to theorize racialization as a process
of becoming-biological. Sade, as Beauvoir points out, is a philosopher
of the flesh and as such privileges, and even prizes, suffering. In
summing up his philosophy, she writes, "[[Pleasant
sensations]{.underline}]{.mark} are too mild; it is when the flesh is
torn and bleeding that it is revealed most dramatically as flesh." Since
suffering [[reveals the body to be a body]{.underline}]{.mark}, we can
theorize becoming-black as an amalgam of suffering and
becoming-biological. If the biological and suffering can be read as
sensations of becoming- black, how do these processes activate [[white
(masochistic) liberal subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}? The answer, I
argue, lies with the structures of sympathy and empathy, which [[fuse
sentiment with fleshiness]{.mark}]{.underline} and rely on the labor of
the black body. Empathy and sympathy are two of racialization's
pleasures of comparison. In *Scenes of Subjection*, [Saidiya [Hartman
illuminates the pernicious undertones of empathy by analyzing the
tableaux of suffering that abolitionists presented to garner support for
their cause]{.mark}. These pleas for emancipation were largely based on
long descriptions of the suffering of slave bodies. Hartman argues that
while pain provided the "common language of humanity," it also "required
that the white body be positioned in the place of the black body in
order to make this suffering visible and]{.underline} Time, Race, and
Biology 99 100 Time, Race, and Biology [intelligible."]{.underline}
[[Empathy]{.underline}]{.mark} functions by asking the listener to
imagine him- or herself in the scene of suffering. Seeing the black body
as biological facilitates this process, but this substitution, a literal
replacement of the white body for the black body, is dangerous both
because it threatens to obliterate the suffering of the black body and
because, as Hartman writes, it risks "naturalizing the condition of
pained embodiment." is, in turn, further [[entrenches blackness within a
biological milieu saturated with pain]{.underline}]{.mark}. Karen
Halfunen links the rise of empathy in the late nineteenth century with
the emergence of "the pornography of pain, which represented pain as
obscenely titillating precisely because the humanitarian sensibility
deemed it unacceptable, taboo."58 As society became more bourgeois, the
desire to inflict or receive pain became a marker of savagery. Pain was
redefined as unacceptable and became repulsive.59 Further, Halfunen
argues, this revulsion coincided with an explosion of fantasies of
beatings, murder, and flogging, all of which made it into
nineteenth-century sexological texts, including Kra-Ebing's
*Psychopathia Sexualis*. [One of the text's more infamous case studies
wrote that he used Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* as grist
for his pornographic fantasies: "Particularly exciting for me was the
thought of a man being hitched to a wagon in which another man sat with
a whip, driving and whipping him." The explicit eroticization of
suffering is striking for its omission of race**. The writer does not
describe the man being whipped as black, but by invoking *Uncle Tom's
Cabin* he does not need to. It is understood that the body that suffers
will be black. Therefore, we cannot consider his pleasure in the scene
without considering race, especially because his pleasure is derived
from the black body in pain**. Whiteness, Farley argues, produces a
"sadistic pleasure" from the black body in pain, whereas the pleasure of
blackness "is a form of humiliation.]{.underline}"61 Hartman argues that
**[[the "black performative is inextricably linked with the specter of
contented subjection]{.mark}, the [torturous display of the
captive]{.mark} body, and [the ravishing of the body that is the
condition of the other's pleasure]{.mark}.]{.underline}**" What is
ambiguous in this fantasy is the narrator's subject position---Is he
identifying with the person being whipped, that is to say, has he
substituted his own body for the body of the suffering black man, is he
the one causing the pain, or is he a voyeur, some- one gaining pleasure
(corporeal, physical, or psychic) from this scenario through the
workings of empathy? We might also draw parallels between empathy and
analogy, which we see most prevalently in rhetoric analogizing
interracial and same-sex marriage prohibitions. Siobhan Somerville
describes the miscegenation analogy as "obscur\[ing\] the complicated
ways in which race and sexual orientation have been intertwined in US
law. Too often the history of interracial heterosexuality in the United
States is narrated as if it had nothing to do with the history of
homosexuality---except as a precedent."63 As Somerville makes clear, the
connection produced by analogy actually works to naturalize each
category and keep them separate. In his own analysis of analogizing
same-sex and interracial marriage, David Eng points out that the
separateness works with a historical amnesia to produce a rhetoric of
color blindness, that is to say, being beyond race.64 In this invocation
of a postracial society, racial difference is theorized as something
that no longer structures rights and privileges, thereby writing out the
black body in favor of the white body. [Th[e intimacy that empathy
produces]{.underline}]{.mark} [in these situations [renders the black
body superflous, made irrelevant by the focus on the present
discomfort]{.mark} of the white body]{.underline}. [Sympathy functions
according to a different though similar pernicious logic. In *Rule of
Sympathy*, Amit Rai argues that in England at the time of the
abolitionist movement sympathy "was a paradoxical mode of power" because
the differences between object and agent were precisely what needed to
be bridged, but "without such differences, which were inequalities of
power, sympathy could not function; sympathy produced the very
inequality it sought to bridge."65]{.underline} [[**Sympathy
demonstrated the humanity of blacks while simultaneously othering
them**. Perversely, those in possession of sympathy were seen as
virtuous, thus further distancing themselves from the objects of their
pity. Here, again, the black body worked to produce white
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can see more clearly how sympathy
operates by looking at a more contemporary example of its failure.
Alfred Blumrosen, a civil rights activist, blames the lack of sympathy
for the difficulty in increasing civil rights in the 1980s. He writes, "
The public sympathy for the plight of black Americans circa 1965 cannot
be recreated, because the condition of black American(s) in 1985 is so
much improved, as a result of the 1964 legislation. e success of the
Civil Rights Act contained the seeds of its loss of public support."66
By arguing that white Americans no longer feel sympathy for black
Americans, Blumrosen makes it clear that sympathy requires the
production of distance. **[According to the logic of
sympathy,]{.underline}** [[white Americans supported the 1964 Civil
Rights Act because the specter of black suffering was distinct from
their own experiences, so that they could objectify and separate
blackness and simultaneously produce themselves as virtuous
subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. Blumrosen highlights the dangers of
sympathy. As a structure reliant on and mobilized by a power imbalance,
it provides shaky ground for a discourse on rights. Ultimately, sympathy
does not tend toward equality; rather, it seeks a preservation of an
imbalanced status quo. Maintaining a sense of the black body as
biological and atemporal is a crucial part of preserving this asymmetry.
Further, the place of the biological in this racialized structure
produces sympathy as one of the sadistic pleasures of comparison that
Farley invokes and foregrounds sympathy's activation of suffering flesh.
When we add race to these structures of sentiment, in addition to
objectification, we get white guilt, in particular white liberal guilt.
We can add a twist to this, however, when we think about Julie Ellison's
analysis of liberal guilt. Though race is at the forefront of her
analysis, as a feeling, guilt, she argues, is particular because it is
marked by inadequate action, that is to say that it produces action that
is "never sufficient to the scale of the problem." [[Echoing
Fanon]{.mark}'s]{.underline} claims about white masochism, Ellison
argues that "[[liberal guilt is bound up with the feeling of
being]{.mark} [implicated in systems of domination and with the
subsequent awareness of the emotional instability]{.mark}]{.underline}
produced by this ambivalent position." [Ultimately, liberal guilt is
born from spectatorship: "[When those who suffer gaze back at those who
do not, guilt is the consequence]{.mark}]{.underline}." **[[This
formulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of liberal guilt
**[[offers]{.underline}]{.mark}** us a way to theorize it as [[a
**racialized performance of passivity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not only
does liberal guilt colonize the suffering of others, but it [[simulates
the powerlessness of circumstance through masochism]{.mark}. [Masochism
cloaks the fact that one *could* act in the face of another's suffering
and produces a discourse of innocence.]{.mark} [This innocence is
complicat]{.mark}]{.underline}[ed]{.mark}; it is constructed through a
focus on the suffering that [guilt]{.mark} produces, which, in turn,
[[manifests itself as empathy and analogizes the white body's current
guilt to the black body's past]{.mark} (and present) trauma. rough
empathy, the substitution of the white body for the black body, current
guilt or suffering distracts from the choice of inaction and produces
color blindness]{.underline}. Here, we see a sharp distinction between
guilt and shame. If Fanon's narrator is flooded with shame, it is
because he has suddenly realized that he *cannot* act. This is where we
see Sedgwick's colloquial difference between the two at work---[[guilt
attaches to what one does]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[while shame attaches
to who one is.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Institutional liquidation of black thought is [a paradigmatic
necessity]{.underline} -- a death-dealing episteme marks the horizon of
recognition and folding of blackness into debate-as-forum. This goes
beyond a commodification claim: the accursed share around blackness
facilitates quotidian violence even within speech acts. Rather than
willfully accept the demand for black debate to pull up its bootstraps
and get back to working, we should question why we even accept this
forum as a medium for redemption. We should mind working because we
should mind dying.**

[[Black Studies interrogates]{.mark} the position of Black persons
during slavery as well as during what Hartman]{.underline} (2007) has
**[called [the "afterlife of slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}**["]{.mark}
wherein "**[black lives are still imperilled and devalued by a racist
calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries
ago,"]{.underline}** [affecting]{.underline} "[skewed life chances,
limited access to healthcare and education, premature death,
incarceration, and impoverishment]{.underline}" (p. 6). At the same time
as many [Black Studies [scholars emphasize]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[the position of Black enslaved]{.mark} per- sons in modernity [is
without analogy]{.mark},]{.underline} they also emphasize that modernity
itself would not have been possible without Black slavery (Sexton,
2015). As Wilderson (2010) put it succinctly, "[No slave, no
world"]{.underline} (p. 11). **[Hence, [the project of Black
Studies]{.mark} has a much broader relevance than to Black people
alone]{.underline}** (James, \[1969\] 1993; Silva, 2014). *The
anti-Blackness of Man* **[The role of slavery and its afterlife in the
ordering of modern social life [operates at many levels,]{.mark} but
perhaps most notably in the notion of humanity itself]{.underline}**. In
her work, Sylvia Wynter offers an important distinction between "Man"
and other **["[genres of the human]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} As
modern Man (Euro-descended, middle-class, college educated) claims to be
the apex of humanity, he deems all other humans---not only racialized
peoples, but also the unemployed, the incarcerated, the homeless---to be
sub- or non-human (Wynter, 1994, 2003). This hierarchy of humanity [[has
been used to justify the over- representation of Man's interests and the
subordination of others to his will.]{.mark}]{.underline} Wynter traces
how the foundations of European modernity entailed a transformation,
starting in the 15th century, from a worldview that transcendentalized
the Church and the desire for salvation, to a worldview that
transcendentalized the State and secularized knowledge (Wynter, 2003).
[However, [the transformations]{.mark} that took place were not
internally produced within Europe, but rather were enabled through
Indigenous colo- nization and Black enslavement.]{.underline} [These
[provided]{.mark}]{.underline} both **[[the material]{.mark} and
conceptual [conditions for the emergence of the West]{.mark}, including
the architectures of the nation- state, capital, and the modern
university.]{.underline}** In order to invent himself, Man had to
forcibly incorporate his Others into a European (conception of the)
world and deny their distinct modes of thinking and being the status of
"alternative modes of being human" (Wynter, 2003: 282). According to
Wynter, it was to be the figure of the Negro (i.e., the category
comprised by all peoples of Black African hereditary descent) that \[the
West\] was to place at the nadir of its Chain of Being; that is, on a
rung of the ladder lower than that of all humans. (p. 301)
Categorization of Black people as non-human and evolutionarily inferior
justified their relegation to what Fanon (2008) famously described as
"the zone of nonbeing" (p. xii). In the era of chattel slavery, this
translated into a logic according to which Black flesh was inscribed and
treated as fungible---that is, interchangeable, accumulable, and objec-
tified as property (Hartman, 1997; King, 2014; Spillers, 1987). [In
addition to studies of slavery, many **[Black Studies]{.mark}** scholars
[address post-emancipation Black subjugation]{.mark}, carefully
[cataloguing the ongoing "material,]{.mark} rhetorical, state,
**[discursive,]{.mark} [intimate, violences]{.mark}** [to which black
bodies and psyches are subjected"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sharpe, 2014b:
206). [**Particularly in the context of this study**, it is imperative
to note that Black people's hard-won increased presence in higher
education institutions does not forestall this subjugation. **Many
[universities continue to employ Black people in poorly compen- sated
and often-precarious staff position]{.mark}s (**]{.underline}Pettit,
2008) [and [contribute to]{.mark} the [gentrifica- tion]{.mark} of
neighborhoods surrounding their campuses, often with significant Black
populations]{.underline} (Baldwin, 2015; Bose, 2014[). [Black]{.mark}
faculty, [students]{.mark}, and staff regularly [experience anti-Black
racism]{.mark} from their peers and professors]{.underline} (e.g.
Griffin et al., 2014; Gusa, 2010; Harper et al., 2011; Johnson-Ahorlu,
2012; Patitu and Hinton, 2003; Patton and Catching, 2009; Solórzano et
al., 2000[) and are interrogated and abused by campus and local
police]{.underline} (e.g. McMillan Cottom, 2014; Vest, 2013).
**[[Anti-Blackness]{.mark} also [inheres in the production of knowledge
itself]{.mark}. [In spite of the many powerful disruptions enacted
through Black Studies]{.mark} and associated fields]{.underline}**,
Sharpe (2014a) argues that **[[an anti-Black "death-dealing episteme
continue\[s\] to be produced in 'think tanks' and in the
university,]{.underline}]{.mark}** by teachers, lecturers, researchers,
and scholars, [[and then reproduced by the students who have been
educated in the classrooms and institu- tions where \[Black people\]
labor"]{.underline}]{.mark} (p. 61). **[[This]{.mark} enduring
"death-dealing [episteme" is not]{.mark} merely [contained within
explicitly white supremacist knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}**, like the
now thor- oughly discredited field of phrenology or even today's more
blatantly pathologizing strains of mainstream social science.
**[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Wynter (1994), "both
**[[the issue of 'race' and its classificatory logic]{.mark}" [are built
into the]{.mark}]{.underline}** basic **[[logic of the modern order of
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}** (p. 47). **[Spillers]{.underline}**
(1987) called this order **[[an "American
grammar]{.mark},"]{.underline}** arguing, "the ruling episteme [[that
releases the dynamics of naming and valuation]{.mark}, remains grounded
in the originating metaphors of captivity and mutilation"]{.underline}
(p. 68). [Yet, not only does [this grammar]{.mark} extend beyond the
United States, it also [extends beyond an enduring order of knowing to
encompass an]{.mark} enduring [order of being]{.mark} as
well.]{.underline} [Silva]{.underline} (2013) **[captures both in her
notion of]{.underline}** "**[[the ontoepistemological grammar]{.mark}
that governs post- Enlightenment accounts of existence"]{.underline}**
(p. 50) [and that structures Man's claims to autonomy,
self-determination, and mastery of universal reason]{.underline}. These
claims are then **[[used to justify]{.mark} the imposition of [Man's

those whom he deems his irrational and outer-determined racial Others.
**[[To consider]{.mark} that [this modern]{.mark}/[colonial
grammar]{.mark}]{.underline}** has endured for over five centuries does
not minimize its internal variation, [the importance of its ongoing
contestation]{.underline}, nor the possibility of its further
rearticulation. **[However, it does [raise questions about]{.mark} the
available [possibilities]{.mark} for justice [within

are [t[hose who act as if the only way to speak]{.mark} or fathom or

enslaved]{.mark}**. But [such calculation is faulty from the
start]{.mark} insofar [as]{.mark} [we are irreducible]{.mark} to what is
done to us**]{.underline}\... (p. 56) Indeed, although **[the modern
global order situates Blackness as "always already a referent of
commodity]{.underline}**, an object, and the other, [as fact beyond
evidence]{.underline}" (Silva, 2014: 81), this in no way delimits what
Black life was, is, and can be. Wilderson clarifies the differ- ence
thusly: "I'm not saying that in this space of negation, which is
blackness, there is no life. We have tremendous life. But this life is
not analogous to those touchstones of cohe- sion that hold civil society
together" (Hartman and Wilderson, 2003: 187). Many have noted that in
excess of both the position of non-being ascribed to Black persons by
modernity's grammar and of Man's narrowly imagined possibilities for
existence, Blackness has always offered ways of knowing and being
otherwise (Moten, 2003, 2008, 2013; Scott and Wynter, 2010; Sexton,
2011; Silva, 2013, 2014). **[According to Silva]{.underline}** (2014),
[[because Man's claims to]{.mark} sovereign [subjecthood]{.mark} [are
dependent upon Black affectability]{.mark} and objecthood]{.underline},
the stability of this relation is constantly under- mined by "the
radical potential Blackness hosts" (p. 84). [**This radical potential
contains "another text \... a grammar that exceeds existing
articulations of the human as a thing of self-determination"**
(]{.underline}Silva, 2013: 57). If Man's conceptual coherence and
material continuation are premised on Blackness as a threatening but
necessary lack and nega- tion, **[then [Black life cannot be adequately
recognized]{.mark} or represented by or through his grammar [without
repeating this violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**Bassichis and Spade** ,**Queer politics and anti-blackness,** **2014**

The project illustrates how a form of gayness implicitly linked to
whiteness¶ and upward mobility stakes its claim to the future. After
all, for whom will it get¶ better? And what kind of better does it get?
[When we consider this directive that¶ life gets better against the
backdrop of the systemic imprisonment, police murder¶ and state
abandonment of black people at every age, we can sec how it is white¶
suffering that this campaig11 aims to make legible as worthy of
protection]{.underline}. [Black¶ suffering]{.underline}, as Jared Sexton
has articulated in his analysis of Hurricane Katrina¶ (Sexton 2006), [is
unspectacular, banal, self-induced, a cause for, if anything,¶ shame or
fascination, not redress.]{.underline} Savage\'s assertion that his
departure from¶ high school protected him from the reach of homophobic
·violence is certainly¶ indicative of a white-owning class trajectory of
matriculation. [What guarantees can¶ be given to those who will remain
in the grasp of foster care systems, homeless¶ shelters, psychiatric
facilities, jails, prisons, and immigration detention centres,¶
regardless of their age? Savage\'s story generalizes a particular
narrative in¶ which white queers can \'escape\' homophobia by moving to
gay enclaves in urban¶ areas, a trajectory out of reach for so many
queer and trans people who will¶ remain targets of policing and
immigration enforcement, even and perhaps¶ especially in white gay
neighbourhoods where they are read as dangerom outsiders¶ (Hanhardt
2008).¶ The fantasy oflife \'getting better\' imagines \'violence\' as
individual acts that \'bad\'¶ people do to \'good\' people who need
protection and retribution from state¶ protectors (law enforcement,
policymakers, administrators), rather than situating¶ bodily terror as
an everyday aspect of a larger regime of structural racialized and¶
gendered violence congealed within practices of criminalization,
immigration¶ \~nforcement, poverty,\'and medicalization targeted at
black people at the population¶ level - from before birth until after
death \-- and most frequently exercised by¶ government employees. It is
not a leap to see, then, how tills cultural politics of¶ naturalizing
the premature death of black people produces a benevolent thrall for¶
white gays and lesbians to adopt black children. White gay and lesbian
politics must¶ remain silent on anti-black racism, must position itself
as anything but black, to¶ keep its place in line for the
future.]{.underline}

### A2 QUEENESS PERFORMANCES 

QUeer and LGBT movements is anti black and white supremacy because as
junior partners they stabilize america

**Bassichis and Spade** ,**Queer politics and anti-blackness,** **2014**

[The \'supplemental anti-blackness\' of the United States\' junior
partners\']{.underline}- those¶ whose grievances might be redressed,
however incompletely, by \'rights\', to which¶ we might add non-black
LGBTQ people - [functions hand in hand with the**¶** systematic state
and para-state violence targeted at black people. The tactics of**¶**
\'crowding out\' black claims]{.underline} (like we see in the poster)
[and the tactics of actively**¶** terrorizing black people are two wings
of the same endeavour. Because \'blackness\'**¶** and \'criminality\'
are wedded in the US lexicon]{.underline}, as Saidiya Hartman argues in
her¶ book Scenes of Subjection (Hartman 1997), [any claims to not being
a criminal- or on**¶** the flipside, to being a citizen- must literally
be made on the backs of black people.**¶** When rights-seeking
constituencies claim they are \'not criminals\', they articulate**¶**
their bid for inclusion through an implicit assertion that they are
\'not black\'. Even**¶** if the articulation is made on behalf of a
group that supposedly does not exclude**¶** black members]{.underline},
as Sexton and VVilderson argue, [such an assertion enters a system**¶**
of meaning that necessarily signifies the group as non-black and appeals
for a**¶** chance to participate in anti-blackness]{.underline}.¶ How
might we bring these analyses to bear in our critiques of the
ascendancy¶ of neoliberal LGBT political and cultural practices? A
growing number of¶ critical thinkers such as Lisa Duggan and Jasbir Puar
have worked to theorize¶ \'homonormativity\' and \'homonationalism\' in
the United States in an effort to¶ disarticulate LGBT political claims
from the absorptive thrall of late capital¶ (Agathangdou, Bassichis and
Spira 2008; Duggan 2004; Puar 2007). [Simultaneously,**¶** we are
witnessing the proliferation and expansion of visionary racial and**¶**
economic justice-focused LGBT activist formations challenging the status
quo of**¶** state violence and structural adjustment, both in terms of
what issues and**¶** constituencies are centered within LGBT political
work as well as the ways in which**¶** the process of organizing and
movement building replicates racial norms and**¶**
domination]{.underline}.3 These critiques and organizing efforts offer a
vital intervention into¶ the frightening alignment of gayness (and
increasingly transgenderness) with¶ capital. They also invite us to
continue exploring the ways in which non-black¶ LGBT political claims
are produced by and reproduce anti-blackness as a¶ foundational
structure of US Americanness. This exploration helps us to situate¶
contemporary LGBT anti-black racism- evidenced in, for example, the
blaming¶ of black voters for the passage of Proposition 8, the
prioritization of sentenceenhancing¶ hate crimes laws as a solution to
ant:i-LGBT hate violence or the failure¶ of the largest LGBT
organizations to oppose the rapid expansion of the prison¶ police
state - as a logical extension of the constitutive and enduring
antagonisms of¶ slavery and its mobilization of racial-sexual norms and
terror. In the vein of critics such as Cathy Cohen and M.Jacqui
Alexander (Alexander 2005; Cohen 1997: 437-\<165) who have persuasively
theorized the ways in which [both the white gay and lesbian rights
framework and many strands of more progressive queer politics
participate in white supremacy\'s tactics of pitting \'good**¶** gays\'
(white, middle class, gender normative, able bodied) against \'bad
queers\'**¶** (black, brown, poor, and disabled, which necessarily mean
gender non-normative),**¶** we want to understand how the basic
assumptions, tactics, and epistemologies**¶** underlying contemporary
queer political claims often unwittingly reproduce and**¶** are
productive of the fundamental structures of anti-blackness, settler
colonialism,**¶** and permanent war undergirding the United States
itself.]{.underline} In this chapter, we¶ explore the implications of
Sexton\'s critique of anti-blackness within the domain¶ of contemporary
gay and lesbian rights politics within the US, as two white activist
scholars¶ invested in advancing and centring anti-racism within queer
and trans¶ political work. Our work here is enabled in particular by
Andy Smith\'s foundational¶ essay, \'Heteropatriarchy and the \'fhree
Pillars of White Supremacy:¶ Rethinking \'IV\' omen of Color
Organizing\' (Smith: 2006) in ·which she suggests that¶ white supremacy
is not singular, but operates in differentiated ways to target¶
different populations. She describes three pillars of white supremacy
the¶ Orientalism/war pillar, the slavery/ capitalism pillar and the
genocide/ colonialism¶ pillar- arguing that white supremacy enacts
different technologies of violence and¶ produces different narratives
and mythologies in each of these pillars. Her work¶ encourages scholars
and activists to analyse the specificity of particular forms of¶ racism,
and acknowledge that people targeted in one pillar can also be made¶
complicit vvith another through promises of inclusion and recognition.
In his article¶ \'People of Color Blindness\', Sexton (20 l 0) argues
that [the failure to look at the**¶** specificity of anti-black racism
in the United States, and the willingness of many**¶** movements and
intellectuals to do two things to analogize other struggles to
antiblack**¶** racism generally and emancipation from slavery
specifically, and to speak**¶** generally about \'racism\' without
attention to the specificities of anti-blackness- is**¶**
anti-black.]{.underline} [While there is a great deal to be said about
how contemporary lesbian**¶** and gay rights advocacy participates in
all three pillars Smith describes, as well**¶** as about how settler
colonialism is indeed foundational along with slavery in the**¶** fabric
of US Americanness, in this chapter we want to look at the specific
ways**¶** that particular US anti-black logics, methods and
institutional arrangements**¶** arc mobilized by some recent campaigns
and events that illustrate Sexton\'s**¶** concerns about how movements
that fail to contest anti-blackness participate in**¶** it.]{.underline}
We look specifically at the focus on reproduction, legal redress, and
analogy¶ within gay and lesbian politics as three key sites that
illustrate these investments.¶ [Critiques of anti-blackness, ultimately,
are necessary to elucidate white supremacy\'s**¶** \'queer\' junior
partnerships, the \'contradictions of coalitions between workers
and**¶** slaves\' (Wildcrson 2007: 33), the ghostly \'continuities of
slavery and freedom\'**¶** (Hartman 1997: 13), and the ways in which the
unspeakable violences at the core**¶** of the US refuse to be subdued by
the latest proclamation of their completion or**¶**
replacement.]{.underline}
