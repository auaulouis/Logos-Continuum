### 1AC- Plan 

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of small arms and light weapons to Mexico from the United States.

### 1AC- Advantage + Solvency 

#### Despite [strict]{.underline} gun regulations, legal exports of small arms from the U.S. are illicitly sold in Mexico, which has enabled [decades of femicide]{.underline}

[Guns are common throughout Mexico, and the country's gun culture dates
back before revolutionary time]{.underline}s. The Mexican Constitution,
as adopted in 1917, recognized Mexican citizens' right to possess arms:
"The [inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess
arms in their homes for their security and legitimate
defense]{.underline} with the exception of those prohibited by federal
law and of those reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Navy, Air
Force, and National Guard" (Kopel 2009). [Despite this legal right,
Mexico has implemented some of the toughest firearms regulations in the
world]{.underline}, particularly since the late 1960s. Between 1968 and
1995, [registration of all weapons was required, and, although
compliance was low, all but one gun store was closed]{.underline} (Kopel
2009). The store, the Directorate for Arms and Munitions Sales, is
located in Mexico City and is run by the Mexican army in a "heavily
guarded building near the army's headquarters" (Hawley 2009). 18

[Because the demand is high and the legal supply is low, the illicit
market is crucial for the cartels: "demand for guns has created an
illicit market that not only is intimately related to the U.S. market
for illegal narcotics but also, in many ways, mirrors the dynamics of
that market.]{.underline} Drugs flow north and guns flow
south---resulting in handsome profits for those willing to run the
risks" (Burton and Stewart 2007). In other words, the trafficking of
arms from the United States to Mexico has the potential of closely
matching the value of the drugs moving in the opposite direction. Since
access to firearms is so strictly controlled in Mexico, drug traffickers
require a dependable source of weapons from outside the country. 19
These sources consist largely of the United States and supply networks
south of Mexico.

Criminal sources from the United States range from an individual who
obtains guns through family members living in the United States to
large, complex organizations capable of buying hundreds of weapons at a
time. Other options for illegally attaining weapons include document
fraud and "straw buyers." In other cases, gun dealers, government
officials, or police officers are corrupt and will knowingly sell
weapons to individuals who are not authorized to possess them. Guns are
also purchased on the Mexican black market after being stolen, such as
those taken from gun stores along the border by Gulf cartel-related
groups (Burton and Stewart 2007). 20

[The **United States has** also **been the primary supplier** of these
**weapons legally imported into Mexico**, such as those used by the
Mexican military and police]{.underline}. Over the past seven years, it
is estimated that over [100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army,
many of whom "took their weapons with them and joined the
cartels]{.underline}. . . . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of
military equipment \[have been\] stolen from its own military and state
police" (Tancredo 2009). In addition, weapons are available "from
contacts along their supply networks in South and Central America, where
substantial quantities of military and ordnance have been shipped over
decades to supply insurgencies and counterinsurgencies" (Burton and
Stewart 2007).

[In 2005, the United States legally exported almost \$50 million worth
of weapons to Latin America]{.underline}. In addition, "[**small arms
flooded Latin America during the Cold War**, most significantly during
the Central American civil wars of the 1980s]{.underline}" (Stohl and
Tuttle 2009). **[These weapons last longer than their original purposes
require and can still be traced as having origins in the United
States.]{.underline}**

High-powered weapons are a different story, as they are not available
through U.S. "straw buyers" or legally provided to Mexico. The majority
of fully automatic weapons cannot be found in the United States, but
they are not uncommon in developing countries. It is argued that
"weapons are smuggled across \[Mexico's\] southern borders from
Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline, weapons
that often originate in Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua, or from
purchases in Eastern Europe" (Tancredo 2009). For instance, the 2,239
grenades and the rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) seized in the last two
years are not available in U.S. gun shops.

[While the trafficking in guns may seem a long way from the **femicide**
in Ciudad Juárez, it has roughly the same importance as the drug trade,
but in reverse.]{.underline} Drugs go north; guns go south. Both
commodities bring an unusually high price due to a limited supply and an
enormous demand. As the supply is reduced, the price goes up, and the
willingness of illegal traffickers to take risks increases (Burton and
Stewart 2007). [In a border characterized by high risk behavior, th**e
murders of young women** that began in 1993 **marked the beginning of**
what was to become **a national crisis**.]{.underline}

#### The Mexican government distributes U.S.-sold weapons to local police and military forces, which are used for massive [human rights violations]{.underline}

[The Mexican military is the only legal importer of firearms into
Mexico. In turn, the Mexican army is the only legal distributor of guns
within the country; personal possession of firearms is highly
restricted, with a single military-run retail store for gun sales in
Mexico City. Aside from the weapons that the military acquires for its
own forces, most legally imported guns in Mexico are sold to state and
local police forces.]{.underline} More than half of the 305,086 guns
sold by the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense -- which includes
the army and air force and is known by its Spanish acronym SEDENA ---
from 2010 through 2016 were sold to police, according to documents
released by SEDENA in response to a public records request. [Since
criminal organizations arm themselves with U.S. assault weapons
illegally trafficked from the U.S. retail market, legal exports to
police and the military are part of a deadly arms race with these
organizations. More than 20,000 firearms obtained by Mexican state and
federal police went missing or were stolen from 2006 to
2017]{.underline}, according to SEDENA data. More than 7,000 of the
weapons went missing from police in Mexico City and Mexico state. In the
state of Guerrero, the number of guns gone missing or stolen between
2010 and 2016 amounts to nearly one-fifth of the firearms police
acquired in the state during the same period.[There is also evidence
that **firearms legally imported** from the United States have been used
in some of the worst human rights violations in Mexico in recent years.
The local police who attacked the 43 Ayotzinapa students [were armed
with AR6530 rifles](https://www.afsc.org/resource/report-where-guns-go),
a model variant of the AR-15, legally supplied through licensed
shipments]{.underline} from Colt, according to documents in the judicial
record. An investigation by Mexico's National Human Rights Commission
found that Federal Police, who carried out the massacre of 22 persons in
Tanhuato, Michoacán, in 2015, killed five of them with Dillon Aero guns
mounted on Black Hawk helicopters. The Dillon guns fire some 125 rounds
per second, and Mexico obtained 16 of them for the army [in
2013](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/285435/ADQS._DE_AERONAVES_ARMAMENTO_Y_VEHICULOS_DIC._17.pdf),
for just over \$1 million, and then another 12 in 2015, according to
Mexico's [most recent Arms Trade Treaty
report](http://www.thearmstradetreaty.org/images/Annual_Reports_2016/Mexico_Annual_Report_2016P.pdf).
These are unusual cases, in that we know which weapons were involved.
Most homicides in Mexico --- including those carried out by state forces
--- are never investigated, so there is no judicial record identifying
the firearms that were used. But [the volume of U.S. firearms going to
Mexico, combined with the well-established record of police and military
forces colluding with organized crime and committing gross human rights
violations, means that U.S. guns are certainly at the scene of many more
crimes.]{.underline} The example of U.S. gun producer Sig Sauer is
instructive as to how guns move from the military to police. In April
2015, [the U.S. State Department issued a \$266 million license to Sig
Sauer: \$265 million for gun sales, and \$1 million for other equipment
and technical support to the Mexican navy, defense ministry, interior
ministry, and federal and state police forces. That year,]{.underline}
[Mexico imported 3,060 rifles, 3,819 pistols, and 505 machines
gun]{.underline}s produced by Sig Sauer's New Hampshire production
facilities.
The [license](https://www.afsc.org/sites/afsc.civicactions.net/files/documents/State%20Dept%20End%20Use%20Controls%20Mexico%2018%20Jan%202017.pdf) also
permits the Mexican navy to assemble Sig Sauer MPX submachine
guns, [capable of firing 850 rounds a
minute](http://www.birlesikltd.com/docs/SIGMPX-Brochure_.pdf), from
"kits" made of parts produced by the company. All told, as of January,
\$29.3 million in guns and gun parts had been exported from Sig Sauer
and other New Hampshire manufacturers to Mexico since April 2015,
according to Census Bureau trade records --- meaning that Sig Sauer has
at least \$235 million left in sales to make before its license expires
in 2024.[Since 2014, the Mexican military has sold 1,400 U.S.-produced
Sig Sauer firearms to police in 18 Mexican states, including states
where there is an extensive record of collusion with organized
crime.]{.underline} On its end, since 2014, the Mexican military has
sold 1,400 U.S.-produced Sig Sauer firearms to police in 18 Mexican
states, including states where there is an extensive record of collusion
with organized crime, such as Tamaulipas, Michoacán, and Chihuahua,
SEDENA records show. [State authorities also distribute these weapons to
local police]{.underline}; in the state of Mexico, for example, Sig
Sauer weapons were sold to police in five municipalities, while Colt
weapons went to three other municipalities, as well as state police,
according to a state police document. According to data recently
released by the Mexican military, other U.S. gun producers that have
exported thousands of firearms each to Mexico for use by the police or
private individuals include: Colt, Bushmaster, Mossberg, Smith & Wesson,
DS Arms, Remington, and Browning. The Mexican military has also
purchased military weapons from U.S. producers Nammo Talley, Barrett
Firearms, and Knight Armament Company since 2014. [In Veracruz, the
police responsible for [at least 15 death squad
murders](http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/mexican-police-allegedly-death-squad-tactics-article-1.3846863) purchased,
since 2013, at least 674 firearms exported by three U.S. arms
companies]{.underline}: Colt, Bushmaster, and Combined Systems,
according to the Veracruz public security secretariat. Local police in
Veracruz also obtained weapons from Sig Sauer and Connecticut-based
Mossberg. Beyond guns, U.S. Census Bureau trade data show that [just
over \$8.3 million in military explosives were delivered to Mexico from
Arizona in September and October 2017]{.underline}, more than in any
year in the last decade for all states combined. (In all of 2016,
military explosives exported from the entire United States to Mexico
amounted to less than \$800,000.) The Census records do not indicate
which company exported the explosives. In addition, Milkor USA, based in
Tucson, sold M32A1 grenade launchers [used by the Mexican military
special
forces](https://www.facebook.com/SentinelMexico1/posts/1142849252485393). In
2017, more than \$5 million worth of grenade launchers were exported to
Mexico from Texas alone. [The permissive U.S. attitude toward gun
exports has prompted several gun producers based in the European Union
to beef up production in the United States, thus evading EU restrictions
on arms sales to countries with widespread violence or human rights
violations.]{.underline} Sig Sauer, for instance, whose parent company
is in Germany, more than quadrupled global exports from the United
States between 2009 and 2016, according to data from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. (Germany stopped approving licenses for
gun exports to Mexico after 2010.) Beretta (Italy) and Glock (Austria)
produce guns in Tennessee and Georgia, respectively, and are the two
brands that Mexico has imported in the largest numbers since 2007, per
SEDENA records. The State Department [in February 2016
issued](https://www.afsc.org/sites/afsc.civicactions.net/files/documents/20160928%20Mexico%20FMS%20DCS%20CN.pdf)a
license to Glock to export more than 11,000 9mm and .45 caliber pistols
from its Smyrna, Georgia, facility for re-sale to Mexican police.

#### The plan solves:

#### Addressing the [legal flow]{.underline} of weaponry is key

<https://www.afsc.org/blogs/mexico-arm-sales>, JKS)**

[The U.S. must address the flow of **legal weaponry** to
Mexico]{.underline}---[weapons that]{.underline} too often [are used
against Mexicans and migrants.]{.underline} Last month, more [details
came to light in the disappearance of 43 student teachers from
Ayotozinapa,]{.underline} Guerrero. The students were in the city of
Iguala one night in September 2014 when they were seized---and
disappeared---by municipal police. [Documents from the Mexican defense
ministry's arms registry list the weapons possessed by the Iguala
municipal police at the time.]{.underline} Among the arms listed: [20
assault rifles produced by Colt's Manufacturing]{.underline},
headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. Colt sold the government those
rifles, which arrived in Iguala in 2013. [U.S.-manufactured assault
rifles were in the possession of Iguala municipal police, who
disappeared 43 college students in 2014.]{.underline} The Ayotzinapa
case has become a linchpin for national and international criticism of
the Mexican government. [U.S. policymakers are becoming increasingly
skeptical about assistance to Mexican police and military
forces]{.underline}, as the government under President Enrique Peña
Nieto has stonewalled investigations into this case and other human
rights violations. But **[policymakers should also apply that skepticism
to stem the massive flow of legal weaponry---]{.underline}**through
grant assistance and official arms sales---**[from the U.S. to Mexican
police and military forces]{.underline}**. Last month, the
Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI)---established by
the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to investigate the
disappearances---released a report that pointed to torture of at least
17 people detained in the case. These were people whose testimony formed
the basis of the government's official account of events, which GIEI had
earlier disproved. A United Nations group of human rights experts said
the GIEI report shows "serious deficiencies in the justice system, a
worrying weakness of the State to investigate with due diligence gross
human rights violations, and the sophisticated level of coordination of
some authorities in the commission of crimes." After GIEI released the
report, the Mexican government declined to renew the group's mandate to
continue its investigation and remained silent in the face of a vicious
media campaign against the group's members. On April 26, thousands of
people---led by families of those Ayotzinapa students---protested the
decision in Mexico City. In the U.S., Senate officials are expected to
demand that the U.S. State Department withhold nearly \$20 million from
counter-drug assistance to Mexico, because of the country's rejection of
human rights concerns. The move would follow an unprecedented cut in
military aid to Mexico last year. But so far, [policymakers in
Washington have not called for a reduction in official U.S. arms sales
to the Mexican police and military, which has amounted to more than
\$3.5 billion since 2012.]{.underline} The Ayotzinapa case is only the
most prominent of serious atrocities of military and police violations
that remain in impunity. The 43 college students are among more than
25,000 people reported disappeared in Mexico. Freedom House called
Mexico an "unfree country" for journalists for the fifth year in a row,
and denounced persecution of human rights activists in the country. The
annual human rights report of the State Department observed that
"impunity and corruption in the law enforcement and justice system
remained serious problems," with police and the military involved in
"unlawful killings, torture, and disappearances." [While Washington has
steadily reduced military and police assistance to Mexico, **U.S. arms
sales to the country have risen in recent years.**]{.underline} And
since 2006, homicide rates in Mexico have climbed with the increase in
arm sales from the U.S. (see our infographic). GIEI said that their work
"was born out of a wound" felt by the family members of the Ayotzinapa
students who were disappeared. AFSC is responding to that wound and
seeking ways to address the flow of weapons that too often are used
against Mexicans and migrants. Next month, an AFSC delegation to Mexico
will meet with family members of those impacted by imported weapons and
Mexican and U.S. officials. In the coming months, we'll share with you
more information on how U.S. policies are fueling violence against
Mexicans and Central American migrants---and keep you up to date on how
to help protect human rights in Mexico.

#### U.S. exports are the biggest internal link to violence in Mexico

**Lindsay-Poland 18** (John Lindsay-Poland, researcher specializing in
Latin American foreign policy with over 30 years of experience.
\"America\'s guns: Made in the US, killing in Mexico,\" Al Jazeera,

https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/america-guns-killing-mexico-180328060253902.html)//Bennerz

[The **legal export of guns** by US gun producers to Mexican police is
also feeding criminal activities and the illegal gun market in Mexico,
in several ways. **The Mexican military is the only legal importer of
firearms in Mexico**]{.underline}; in turn, [it sells weapons to police
throughout the country, and, to a lesser extent, to private individuals
and security companies. State and local police in Mexico have had more
than 20,000 firearms go missing or stolen since 2006, according to
Mexican military documents]{.underline}. More than 8,000 rifles and
handguns disappeared during that time from police arsenals in the city
and state of Mexico and Guerrero state alone. In Guerrero, infamous for
corruption and human rights violations by its police and military, [out
of every five firearms legally acquired by police, more than one went
missing or stolen]{.underline}. [US exports of weapons to the Mexican
armed forces have grown enormously as part of the militarised security
strategy that has disastrously failed to reduce homicides]{.underline}.
The use of state weapons in operations to decapitate the leadership of
criminal organisations has provoked more violence among prospective
successors, while also feeding an arms race between criminal groups and
the parts of the state that fight them. In addition, **[many Mexican
police armed with US weapons directly commit human rights
violations]{.underline}**. The local police who attacked students from
the Ayotzinapa teachers school and disappeared 43 of them in 2014, for
example, were armed with AR-15 rifles exported by Colt Industries in
Connecticut, according to court records. [When police collude with
criminal organisations by giving them information or fighting their
rivals in exchange for money, they are strengthening organised
crime]{.underline}, even without directly trafficking weapons to it.
[**US gun exports to Mexico thus strengthen the very forces, in many
instances, that the arms sales are supposed to combat.** The Trump
administration plans to deregulate such sales further, which will likely
lead to even more US weapons in the hands of corrupt or abusive military
and police forces]{.underline}. **[The US should instead suspend gun
export licenses to Mexico]{.underline}** and reorient its security
policy there.

#### Most weapons begin as legal purchases before becoming trafficked

**Lumpe 97** (Lora Lumpe, 12-12-1997, "U.S. Policy on Small/Light Arms
Exports," <https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/AAAS.html)//EK>

At the same time it is pursuing these laudable initiatives, however[,
the U.S. government sells, gives or licenses for export hundreds of
thousands of guns annually and vast quantities of ammunition. Many
U.S.-source small and light arms enter into illegal circulation. In
1993, foreign governments reported 6,238 unlawfully acquired U.S.-origin
firearms to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Over
half\--3,376\--were discovered in
Mexico.[(3)](https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/AAAS.html#N_3_)]{.underline}
According to President Clinton\'s statement at the signing of the OAS
convention on illicit arms trafficking, in November 1997, the BATF
received approximately 30,000 requests in 1996 from OAS member states to
trace weapons used in crimes. [**For the most part, these weapons are
legally sold, either domestically or abroad,** and later re-transferred
to another party in contravention of U.S. law.]{.underline}

#### Only restricting FMS and DCS solves

**Gagne 15** (David Gagne. Senior editor at InSight Crime, \"New
Strategy, Familiar Result: Militarization in Mexico,\" InSight Crime,
3-25-2015,
https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/new-strategy-familiar-result-militarization-in-mexico/)//Bennerz

[The dramatic increase in **FMS spending** suggests Mexico will continue
to rely heavily on militarized security forces in its so-called war on
drugs]{.underline}. Sarah Kinosian, the lead Latin America researcher at
the Center for International Policy, told InSight Crime [the surge in
**FMS weapon sales** is "an indication that the militarization of the
drug war \[in Mexico\] is here to stay." Recent data on direct
commercial sales]{.underline} --- [the other avenue through which Mexico
purchases weapons from the United States --- provides further indication
of the country's continued militarization]{.underline}. [After a
tripling in **direct commercial sales** between 2011 and 2012, from
under \$400,000 to more than \$1.2 billion, spending remained above \$1
billion in 2013]{.underline}, President Enrique Peña Nieto's first year
in office. (Information on direct commercial sales for 2014 has yet to
be released.) [Ongoing militarization is an unsettling prospect,
considering human rights watchdog groups have linked Mexico's military
build-up]{.underline} under former President Felipe Calderon **[to a
sharp rise in reports of torture and abuse by security
personnel.]{.underline}** While the military has said the reports of
abuse are going down, other [incidents suggest authorities are
struggling to reign in human rights abuses --- such as last year's Army
massacre of at least 15 people, and recent revelations that the Army
knew about police attacks against student protestors in Guerrero, yet
did nothing.]{.underline} The recent splurge on military spending is
also disappointing given President Peña Nieto has previously hinted at a
new approach towards security. After taking office in December 2012,
Peña Nieto withdrew the military from some parts of the country, and
signaled that his government intended to further reduce the military's
role in domestic security by deploying a specialized police unit, known
as the gendarmarie. In practice, however, Peña Nieto's security approach
has differed only slightly from that of his predecessor, and the
gendarmarie has been dramatically scaled back.

#### U.S. gun shops aren't a primary cause for illicit weapons- owners have too many incentives to risk it 

**Kuhn and Bunker 11**

**(David A. Kuhn- VTM Solutions; & Robert J. Bunker- Epochal Warfare
Studies, (2011) Just where do Mexican cartel weapons come from?, Small
Wars & Insurgencies, 22:5, 807-834, DOI: 10.1080/09592318.2011.620815,
JKS)**

US gun shops

As previously discussed in the literature search, [there are a
significant number of published reports and papers that would lead any
prudent reader to believe that the overwhelming portion of the illegal
weapons entering Mexico were originally purchased (legally or illegally)
at gun shops or at gun shows within the United States. **This is not
only far from the truth; it is an incorrect perception** that is being
continually fed by political views and the media at large]{.underline},
regardless of the various agendas that those views may reflect. [To
completely comprehend this dynamic, it is important to understand the
mechanism by which any individual can physically obtain any item within
the United States that is classified as a 'firear]{.underline}m' under
the 1968 Federal Firearms Act.33 [Although general gun laws related to
possession, sale, zoning, and carry vary from state to state, the 1968
Federal Firearms Act, to include all subsequent federal regulations, add
to all existing regulations within the 50 states]{.underline}.
Essentially, federal firearms regulations supersede individual state
regulations, however, if an individual state regulation declares the
purchase or possession of a firearm or component to be illegal, federal
law will not interfere with that legislation as long as it does not
weaken federal law, and the legislation continues to remain as part of
that state's statutes. [Theoretically, firearms produced within the
United States are tracked from the moment that they are serialized on
the factory assembly line.]{.underline} [Any firearm produced within the
US in the last 43 years that comes to the attention of law enforcement
can immediately be traced back to the factory that produced it, the
distributor that received it, and to the gun shop that ordered it from
the distributor]{.underline}. [The few foreign firearms that the BATF
allows to be legally imported into the US are also tracked from a
primary point of distribution]{.underline} once they enter the country.
[When a federally licensed firearm dealer]{.underline} (or sporting
goods/gun shop operating under such license) [within the US receives a
firearm from a distributor, factory, or private individual, that firearm
must be immediately entered into the permanent record book of the
licensee]{.underline}. Information relevant to the actual firearm
includes: description (rifle or pistol), manufacturer, model, type,
serial number, caliber, and barrel length.34 In reality, it is
recognized that mistakes are sometimes made by error and omission and
intentional wrongdoing, even malfeasance, comes into play which
undermines these strict safeguards and ensures that some weapons do get
into the hands of criminals. [Still, all federally licensed firearms
dealers/gun shops within the US, and their firearms disposition records
books, are subject to random inspections]{.underline} (without notice)
by the BATF. [During such inspections, any discrepancy regarding
transactions, disposition/location of firearms, or unrecorded firearms
on site, will result in serious consequences for the licensee. Often
random checks of records where minor administrative errors are found
will result in a complete BATF inventory audit]{.underline} initiated by
the agent in charge. Such an audit is exhaustive in scope, and may
extend well in excess of two or more weeks for an average size shop. If
such a BATF audit occurs, records will often be removed from the site to
a secure location until the agency can establish that no impropriety has
taken place. [For all gun shop owners, the record keeping protocols and
regulations that they must follow are extensive and unforgiving of
errors. This system (federal) is set up in such a manner so as to expose
and **prosecute any attempt to circumvent** it.]{.underline} **[Gun shop
owners have a strong incentive to detect and defeat 'straw' purchases or
third party sales, and suspicious or unqualified buyers.]{.underline}**
Additionally, they are required to file a 'Record of Multiple Firearms
Purchase' if a buyer purchases more than a single firearm at the time of
transaction, and within a certain time frame.

#### The plan is morally necessary even in the face of alt causes and fill-in. You shouldn't endorse state-sanctioned violence just because another country might.

result in arming the cartels due to the cross-pollination between
corrupt segments of the Mexican army and the cartels]{.underline}. Even
the National Shooting Sports Foundation's Larry Keane told CBS News,
"There have been 150,000 or more Mexican soldiers defect to go work for
the cartels, and I think it's safe to assume that when they defect they
take their firearms with them." It has also been argued that [the
Mexican army has played a significant role in the shooting of civilians,
and that, at least in some cases, they used guns sold to them by US
companies.]{.underline} Furthermore, Bowden and Molloy make the case
that even if a lot of guns stopped coming from the United States, the
cartels and the Mexican government have billions of dollars to find
other suppliers. Bowden and Molloy, who shared with Truthout their
concerns that the issue of guns being supplied from the United States
should not divert attention from the Mexican government's role in the
ongoing Mexican killings, may very well be correct. **[But regardless of
whether the number of guns from the US is 90 percent, 70 percent, or
even 50 percent or less of the cartels,' Mexican military's and "law
enforcement's" firepower -- and regardless of whether these same parties
who kill civilians have vast financial resources to buy firearms from
other nations -- at the current moment, isn't it the moral obligation of
the United States to limit its role in enabling the war-zone number of
killings in Mexico?]{.underline}** [This is one of the tacit deals that
underlies US drugs and gun policy: we buy the drugs from Mexico, and the
cartels buy many of their guns from us via straw purchasers and other
illicit acquisition or with State Department sanction for the military
and police.]{.underline} Disregard the political rhetoric; this is the
reality in this grim exchange of goods, whatever "the collateral
damage."

### 1AC- Framing

#### Small arms play a unique role in [everyday violence]{.underline} against women. Widespread access to small arms generates militarized masculinities that outlast wars and traditional understandings of "peace." Focusing on questions of 'alt causes' is not neutral, but directly contributes to the mundane acceptance of gender violence.

[War violently disrupts political, social and cultural mores: and this
destruction]{.underline} of values always [has]{.underline} particular
[implications for gender relations]{.underline}, as decades of feminist
scholarship has observed.38 **[Small arms play a significant part in the
process of social destruction,]{.underline}** and their presence has a
profound impact on how a society reshapes itself after conflict. [Yet
international attention has focused in a narrowly instrumental way on
supply-related issues, which does not sufficiently promote consideration
of the political dimensions of the trade in small arms.]{.underline}
[There has also been a tendency to characterize the problem of small
arms as one which results from 'illicit' or 'criminal activity', with
'illegal' guns]{.underline}. [Such thinking leads not to meaningful
actions to tackle the effects of these weapons and the **structural
violence** in which they are embedded, but to continued vagueness and
abstraction, especially about how women's lives are
impacted.]{.underline} As a result, we still live in a world where there
is little commitment to understanding the magnitude or scale of the
problem, and from which few strategies for combating it can be
developed. [From a feminist perspective, a shift in attitude to the
impact of small arms and light weapons, whether they are legitimately
owned and subject to legislated control or not, is well
overdue.]{.underline} [Feminists have long questioned the broad tendency
to understand violence in a fragmented way that reduces our awareness of
it as an egregious social phenomenon, whether it occurs in the domestic
sphere or in the arena of war,]{.underline} at the point of a weapon
that is legally owned or one that is not.40 [Feminist responses to
violence highlight that it is not private and individualized, but
socially and structurally produced]{.underline}.41 From this
perspective, [an exclusive focus on the high levels of political
violence which occur in and after a war, or on the technical problems
posed by weapons proliferation, can hide the effects of other violence,
often socially sanctioned, **which predates war and continues in
peacetime**.]{.underline} Because the purpose of most new wars is
neither liberation nor social transformation, attitudes which endorse
violence as an appropriate response to conflict or stress may not
measurably change in the aftermath. In such instances, [**women's bodies
all too often become the 'shock absorbers** of the social dislocations
which are the legacy of many years of war', continuing to bear the brunt
of militarized conceptions of masculinity long after a war has
officially come to an end.]{.underline}42 [Readily available guns, and
social attitudes that tolerate gun ownership and use, significantly
contribute to women's insecurity]{.underline} in a post-war situation.43
In societies which have become habituated to high levels of aggression,
women and other vulnerable members of society continue to bear the brunt
of violent acts. This is one reason why [gender-aware
research]{.underline} on the impacts of small arms proliferation is so
important: it **[is an invaluable means to trace the links between
'everyday' violence and the 'unspeakable' extremes of violence seen in
conflict situations.]{.underline}** Feminist peace researchers would
argue that these links derive, to a large extent, from the prevalence of
gender ideologies which promote and glorify male superiority and condone
its expression through aggression, giving men a form of power over
women, children and other 'inferior' men that can be readily expressed
through physically violating them.44 [The acknowledgement of this fact
l]{.underline}ies at the heart of gender-aware peace research, whose
purpose, then, [is ultimately to challenge ideologies which preserve and
support the continuation of violence in all societies -- those which are
caught up in violent conflict as well as those that are supposedly 'at
peace'.]{.underline} Social attitudes which implicitly condone violence
against women can only be overcome by concerted actions which are based
in carefully documented evidence and gendered analysis of how easily
available firearms impact on women's lives. Locally, accurate statistics
are vital for the development of new, more far-reaching legislation.
That gun laws need to be upgraded within terms that are gender-aware and
responsive to the particular needs of women is essential for the
peaceful development of a region, because, as existing research
highlights, in aggression-prone societies the most vulnerable members
must struggle daily against the effects of a continuum of violence, even
in a peacetime context. For women, and often for children, then[, it is
devastatingly misleading to refer to gun-related trauma as something
which happens most frequently in times of violent upheaval, in other
words, outside of 'normality']{.underline}. [It is also inaccurate to
focus on the danger of 'illicit' small arms that are used in 'criminal'
activity, as if gun misuse were not directly correlated to ideologies
that support the use of violence, even in the home, and even in times of
peace.]{.underline} Evidence shows that [distinguishing between the
impact of licit and illicit weapons in post-conflict zones characterized
by robust gun cultures is, anyway, moot]{.underline}: in the southern
African region, it has been proven that firearms used in criminal
activities are systematically obtained through targeting those who first
obtained them legally.45 **[For those who fall victim to such weapons,
discourses on control that focus on a distinction in how firearms are
obtained do little more than 'support the process of minimizing and
silencing evidence of violence' in their everyday
lives]{.underline}**.46 [Easy access to guns, however they are come by,
shores up traditions of militarized masculinity and plays a significant
part in the frighteningly high tolerance of gender-based violence that
characterizes many countries in the region]{.underline}.47 I have
focused, so far, on the ways in which accessible small arms may increase
violence against women in the domestic and public sphere. As I have
shown, while far more men than women die at the point of a gun around
the world, [the easy availability of small arms plays a particularly
egregious role in maintaining male dominance and facilitating the
violence perpetrated against women in conflict zones]{.underline}.
However, as I highlighted earlier in this paper, it is inappropriate to
consider the impact of weapons proliferation on women in terms of a
dichotomy which portrays 'women as victims' and 'men as perpetrators'.
Instead, [we have to analyze the complex ways in which the widespread
presence of guns and other light weapons support ideologies of
masculinity and femininity.]{.underline}

#### Large-scale threats of future suffering collapses ethics and creates a form of temporal blackmail- the only ethical response is to refuse that bribery and align yourself with feminist urgency

Hill, 'Geography and Ethics I: Waiting and Urgency,' Progress in Human
Geography, vol. 39 no. 4, pp. 517-526)**

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that [the body is]{.underline}
increasingly set [at odds with larger scale ethical
concerns,]{.underline} especially [large-scale future events
of]{.underline} forecasted [suffering]{.underline}. Emergency planning
is a particularly good example in which the large-scale threats of
future suffering can distort moral reasoning. Žižek (2006) lightly
develops this point in the context of the war on terror, where in the
presence of fictitious and real ticking clocks and warning systems, [the
urgent body must be bypassed because there are bigger scales to worry
about:¶ What does this]{.underline} all-pervasive sense of urgency [mean
ethically? The pressure of events is so overbearing, the stakes are so
high, that they necessitate a suspension of ordinary ethical concerns.
After all, displaying moral qualms when the lives of millions are at
stake plays into the hands of the enemy.]{.underline} (Žižek, 2006)¶ [In
the presence of large-scale future emergency, the urgency to secure the
state,]{.underline} the citizenry, the economy, or the climate [creates
new scales and]{.underline} new [temporal orders of
response]{.underline} (see Anderson, 2010; Baldwin, 2012; Dalby, 2013;
Morrissey, 2012), [many of which treat the urgent body as impulsive and
thus requiring management]{.underline}. McDonald's (2013) analysis of
three interconnected discourses of 'climate security' illustrates how
bodily urgency in climate change is also recast as a menacing impulse
that might require exclusion from moral reckoning. The logics of climate
security, especially those related to national security, 'can encourage
perverse political responses that not only fail to respond effectively
to climate change but may present victims of it as a threat' (McDonald,
2013: 49). [**Bodies that are currently suffering cannot be urgent,
because they are excluded from the potential collectivity that could be
suffering everywhere in some future time**. Similar bypassing of
existing bodily urgency is echoed in writing about violent
securitization, such as drone warfare]{.underline} (Shaw and Akhter,
2012), [and also in intimate scales like the street and the school,
especially in relation to race]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2009; Young et
al., 2014).¶ [As large-scale urgent concerns are institutionalized, the
urgent body is increasingly obscured through technical planning and
coordination]{.underline} (Anderson and Adey, 2012). [The predominant
characteristic of this institutionalization of large-scale emergency is
a 'built-in bias for action']{.underline} (Wuthnow, 2010: 212) that
circumvents contingencies. The urgent body is at best an assumed
eventuality, one that will likely require another state of waiting, such
as triage (e.g. Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin (2013) cautions that in
much of the West, governmental need to provide evidence of laissez-faire
governing on the one hand, and assurance of strength in facing a
threatening future on the other, produces 'just-in-case preparedness'
(Amin, 2013: 151) of neoliberal risk management policies. In the US,
'[personal ingenuity' is built into emergency response at the expense of
the poor and vulnerable for whom '\[t\]he difference between abjection
and bearable survival']{.underline} (Amin, 2013: 153) [will not be
determined by emergency planning, but in the material infrastructure of
the city.]{.underline}¶ In short, [the urgencies of the body provide
justifications for social exclusion of the most marginalized based on
impulse and perceived threat, while large-scale future emergencies
effectively absorb the deliberative power of urgency into the
institutions of preparedness and risk avoidance.]{.underline} Žižek
references Arendt's (2006) analysis of the banality of evil to explain
the current state of ethical reasoning under the war on terror, noting
that people who perform morally reprehensible actions under the
conditions of urgency assume a 'tragic-ethic grandeur' (Žižek, 2006) by
sacrificing their own morality for the good of the state. But his
analysis fails to note that [bodies]{.underline} are [today]{.underline}
so [rarely legitimate sites for claiming urgency.]{.underline} [In the
context of the assumed priority of the large-scale future emergency, the
urgent body becomes literally nonsense,]{.underline} a non sequitur
within societies, states and worlds that will always be more urgent.¶ If
the important ethical work of urgency has been to identify that which
must not wait, then the capture of the power and persuasiveness of
urgency by large-scale future emergencies has consequences for the kinds
of normative arguments we can raise on behalf of urgent bodies. How,
then, might waiting compare as a normative description and critique in
our own urgent time? [Waiting]{.underline} can be categorized according
to its purpose or outcome (see Corbridge, 2004; Gray, 2011), but it also
[modifies the place of the individual in society and her
importance.]{.underline} As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes, '[waiting ...
produces hierarchies which segregate people and places into those which
matter and those which do not']{.underline}. The segregation of waiting
might produce effects that counteract suffering, however, and Jeffery
(2008: 957) explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be
repressive, it can also engender creative political engagement. In his
research with educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years
waiting for desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal
suffering and sense of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate
cultural and political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and
spatial effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though this is not the same as
claiming normative neutrality for waiting, it does suggest that waiting
is more ethically ambivalent and open than urgency.¶ In other contexts,
however, our descriptions of waiting indicate a strong condemnation of
its effects upon the subjects of study. Waiting can demobilize radical
reform, depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary possibilities of the present
by delaying the revolutionary imperative to a future moment that is
forever drifting towards infinity' (Springer, 2014: 407). Yonucu's
(2011) analysis of the self-destructive activities of disrespected
working-class youth in Istanbul suggests that this sense of infinite
waiting can lead not only to depoliticization, but also to a disbelief
in the possibility of a future self of any value. [Waiting]{.underline},
like urgency, [can undermine the possibility of self-care two-fold,
first by making people wait for essential needs, and again by
reinforcing that waiting is '\[s\]omething to be ashamed of because it
may be noted or taken as evidence of indolence or low status, seen as a
symptom of rejection or a signal to exclude']{.underline} (Bauman, 2004:
109). This is why Auyero (2012) suggests that waiting creates an ideal
state subject, providing 'temporal processes in and through which
political subordination is produced' (Auyero, 2012: loc. 90; see also
Secor, 2007). Furthermore, Auyero notes, it is not only political
subordination, but the subjective effect of waiting that secures
domination, as citizens and non-citizens find themselves 'waiting
hopefully and then frustratedly for others to make decisions, and in
effect surrendering to the authority of others' (Auyero, 2012: loc.
123).¶ Waiting can therefore function as a potentially important spatial
technology of the elite and powerful, mobilized not only for the purpose
of governing individuals, but also to retain claims over moral urgency.
But there is growing resistance to the capture of claims of urgency by
the elite, and it is important to note that even in cases where the
material conditions of containment are currently impenetrable, arguments
based on human value are at the forefront of reclaiming urgency for the
body. In detention centers, clandestine prisons, state borders and
refugee camps, geographers point to ongoing struggles against the
ethical impossibility of bodily urgency and a rejection of states of
waiting (see Conlon, 2011; Darling, 2009, 2011; Garmany, 2012; Mountz et
al., 2013; Schuster, 2011). Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of a Delhi
resettlement colony and Shewly's (2013) discussion of the enclave
between India and Bangladesh describe people who refuse to give up their
own status as legitimately urgent, even in the context of larger scale
politics. Similarly, Tyler's (2013) account of desperate female
detainees stripping off their clothes to expose their humanness and
suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in the UK
suggests that demands for recognition are not just about politics, but
also about the acknowledgement of humanness and the irrevocable
possibility of being that which cannot wait. The continued existence of
places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions in the USA nonetheless
points to the challenge of exposing the urgent body as a moral priority
when it is so easily hidden from view, and also reminds us that our
research can help to explain the relationships between normative
dimensions and the political and social conditions of struggle.¶ In
closing, geographic depictions of waiting do seem to evocatively
describe otherwise obscured suffering (e.g. Bennett, 2011), but it is
striking how rarely these descriptions also use the language of urgency.
Given the discussion above, what might be accomplished -- and risked --
by incorporating urgency more overtly and deliberately into our
discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned bodies? [Urgency can
clarify the implicit but understated ethical consequences and
normativity associated with waiting, and encourage explicit discussion
about harmful suffering. Waiting can be productive or unproductive for
radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires response.]{.underline}
Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical work of
urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying common
spatial misunderstandings and representations. There is good reason to
be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards inhumanity
can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human, dividing
up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those whose
lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives at
all' (Butler, 2009: 50). But when [the urgent body is rendered as only
waiting, both materially and discursively, it is just as easily cast as
impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline} (see also McKittrick,
2006). [Feminist theory insists that the urgent body, whose encounters
of violence are 'usually framed as private, apolitical and
mundane']{.underline} (Pain, 2014: 8), [are as deeply political, public,
and exceptional as other forms of violence]{.underline} (Phillips, 2008;
Pratt, 2005). Insisting that a suffering body, now, is that which cannot
wait, has the ethical effect of drawing it into consideration alongside
the political, public and exceptional scope of large-scale futures. It
may help us insist on the body, both as a single unit and a plurality,
as a legitimate scale of normative priority and social care.¶ In this
report, I have explored old and new reflections on the ethical work of
urgency and waiting. Geographic research suggests a contemporary popular
bias towards the urgency of large-scale futures, institutionalized in
ways that further obscure and discredit the urgencies of the body. This
bias also justifies the production of new waiting places in our material
landscape, places like the detention center and the waiting room. In
some cases, waiting is normatively neutral, even providing opportunities
for alternative politics. In others, the technologies of waiting serve
to manage potentially problematic bodies, leading to suspended suffering
and even to extermination (e.g. Wright, 2013). One of my aims has been
to suggest that moral reasoning is important both because it exposes
normative biases against subjugated people, and because it potentially
provides routes toward struggle where claims to urgency seem to
foreclose the possibilities of alleviation of suffering. [Saving the
world still should require a debate about whose world is being saved,
when, and at what cost -- and this requires a debate about what really
cannot wait]{.underline}. My next report will extend some of these
concerns by reviewing how feelings of urgency, as well as hope, fear,
and other emotions, have played a role in geography and ethical
reasoning.¶ I conclude, however, by pulling together past and present.
In 1972, Gilbert White asked why geographers were not engaging 'the
truly urgent questions' (1972: 101) such as racial repression, decaying
cities, economic inequality, and global environmental destruction. His
question highlights just how much the discipline has changed, but it is
also unnerving in its echoes of our contemporary problems. Since White's
writing, our moral reasoning has been stretched to consider the future
body and the more-than-human, alongside the presently urgent body --
topics and concerns that I have not taken up in this review but which
will provide their own new possibilities for urgent concerns. My own
hope presently is drawn from an acknowledgement that the temporal
characteristics of contemporary capitalism can be interrupted in
creative ways (Sharma, 2014), with the possibility of squaring the
urgent body with our large-scale future concerns. Temporal alternatives
already exist in ongoing and emerging revolutions and the disruption of
claims of cycles and circular political processes (e.g. Lombard, 2013;
Reyes, 2012). Though calls for urgency will certainly be used to obscure
evasion of responsibility (e.g. Gilmore, 2008: 56, fn 6), they may also
serve as fertile ground for radical critique, a truly fierce urgency for
now[.]{.underline}

#### The metrics and justifications for feminist policies matter just as much as the ends. Moves to resolve the aff by using masculine forms of risk calculus are antithetical to the ethical demands of the plan.

Some studies that focus on assessing the success of gender mainstreaming
practices at the level of the European Union point to a similar
phenomenon of \"adding other goals,\" as happened in the Message to the
Committee of Ministers to Steering Committees of the Council of Europe
on Gender Mainstreaming. In Hafner-Burton and Pollack\'s analysis (2000)
of five areas (structural funds, employment and social affairs,
development, competition and science, research and development), the
accent is on explaining cross-sectional variety within the European
Commission in the start and the implementation of gender mainstreaming.
They show how important it has been that political opportunities in
Europe have widened and increased over the course of the last decade,
for instance as a result of the entrance of the Nordic countries. They
also show how important lobbying and modernization have been, for
instance the lobbying of WISE (the European organization for women\'s
studies) in the case of gender mainstreaming in science, research, and
development. In assessing the success of gender mainstreaming, they
refer to classical power mechanisms that are at the heart of social
movement theory: political opportunities and mobilizing. In the context
of this article, the most interesting part of their analysis is their
use of the concept of strategical framing, another power mechanism
conceptualized in social movement theory. Strategical framing is a
dynamic concept that enables us to see how [different actors
adapt]{.underline} existing [policy frames to pursue]{.underline} their
[prospective goals]{.underline}. Strategical framing is defined as
attempting to construct a fit between existing frames, or networks of
meaning, and the frames of a change agent. Hafner-Burton and Pollack
show that [gender]{.underline} mainstreaming [is \"sold\" as
a]{.underline}n effective [means to the ends]{.underline} pursued by the
European Commission, [rather than as an overt challenge to those
ends.]{.underline} They argue that the [gender mainstreaming efforts,
because of this strategical framing, might turn into an integrationist
approach, integrating]{.underline} women and [gender issues
into]{.underline} specific [regular policies rather than
rethinking]{.underline} the [fundamental aims]{.underline} of the
European Union [from a gender perspective]{.underline}. Especially since
the European Union is one of the most successful implementers of gender
mainstreaming so far, [this threatens]{.underline} the [transformative
potential]{.underline} of gender mainstreaming, they say. \[End Page
358\] Mary Braithwaite\'s work on gender mainstreaming in the structural
funds (1999) corroborates these findings. She finds that because of the
absence of precise objectives on reducing gender inequalities, [gender
is easily located within and has been subjected to other
goals]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} employment creation, [economic
growth, or poverty]{.underline} reduction. This is not to say that these
are abject goals, just to stress that they are not synonymous with
gender equality. Braithwaite concludes that gender equity suffers from
the dominance of efficiency and effectiveness in gender mainstreaming
practices in the structural funds. Strategical Framing and Power The
studies presented point out that \"success,\" in the sense of starting a
process of gender mainstreaming, seems to be connected to the
\"stretching\" of the goal of gender equality, to strategical framing,
and they also show that the actual goal of gender mainstreaming is not
articulated clearly. In the last section of this article, I will
therefore take a closer look at framing processes, at the politics of
framing. What happens in processes of strategical framing? Why would it
be that integration rather than transformation is the inevitable result
of strategical framing processes? Strategical framing refers to a
process of linking a feminist goal, such as gender equality, to some
major goal of an organization that should engage or is engaging in
gender mainstreaming, thereby securing the allegiance of these
organizations to gender mainstreaming. In technical terms, this means
that until now strategical framing in gender mainstreaming practices has
usually involved framing bridging or frame extension6 (Benford and Snow
2000). The strategies chosen do not challenge the other, mainstream
goals of policy makers, but provide for a link by \"stretching\" the
gender equality goal. This means that [the dual agenda]{.underline} that
is mostly present in gender mainstreaming ([of the feminist goal and
some other goal]{.underline}) [is presented as]{.underline} the
possibility of [a win-win situation. In such conceptualizations, power
seems to evaporate;]{.underline} it is [put between
brackets.]{.underline} Gender mainstreaming is presented as a harmonious
process, certainly in the Council of Europe report. The state is also
mostly conceptualized as \"friendly,\" probably connected to the fact
that Sweden and the Netherlands have been among its pioneers, countries
that to some extent have been \"friendly\" states in the past. Yet, if
gender inequality is about power and privileges, then gender
mainstreaming should be about abolishing privileges, and if gender
mainstreaming is about [eliminating gender bias in policy making, then
the state should be problematized]{.underline}. Why then is a process of
abolishing privileges and gender bias conceptualized as harmony? The
answer provided in the studies discussed earlier is that it helps in
organizing acceptance of gender mainstreaming, by making it less \[End
Page 359\] threatening. The consequence of this avoidance of struggle is
the exclusion of opposing voices, including radical feminist voices. The
[\"Beyond Armchair Feminism\" volume of Organization (2000) is one of
the few studies analyzing the bad results of such a dual agenda: the
disappearance of a gender focus altogether]{.underline}. Coleman and
Rippin (2000) conclude, after having tried such a process of harmonious
change, that [there needs to be more challenge and less agreement in
such change]{.underline} processes, even if trust is a crucial
component. The presentation of harmony, used to help smooth the process
of change, is counterproductive in the end. In Hearn\'s (2000)
reflection on the project, not only organizations are gendered (in the
Acker 1990 definition), but also models of organizational or societal
change are gendered, as well as embodying other forms of social division
and domination. Following this analysis, [change processes]{.underline}
and hence gender mainstreaming processes and activities [should be
conceptualized as]{.underline} necessarily [riddled with
power,]{.underline} subject to mechanisms of power, and best understood
in terms of power. Looking at processes of strategical framing as
connected to power relations through a Foucauldian lens shows the logic
of the dual agenda as a mix of enabling and constraining processes. The
main enabling part is the opening generated by the bridging of frames.
Yet, in this logic that juxtaposes two sets of goals, some options are
repressed. Exposing the \"organization\" goal as not neutral, but
already gendered, or positioning the \"feminist\" goal as an
organization goal in its own right, will be difficult. As organizations
tend to have a self-image of gender neutrality, the gender bias in their
existing goals will not easily be recognized. And as [both goals will
hardly]{.underline} ever [be backed by equal power resources, the
feminist goal will be watered down]{.underline} much more, or much more
easily than the organization goal. [Moreover, in the process of
convincing organizations or people to start a process of gender
mainstreaming, there will]{.underline} already [be a tendency to
select]{.underline} more [\"acceptable\" feminist goals]{.underline}.
Also, the feminists or femocrats involved in these efforts will
necessarily have some kind of acceptance by the (gender-biased)
organization[, leading to further]{.underline} selection and [exclusion
of radical or marginalized voices]{.underline}. The logic of [the dual
agenda]{.underline} therefore [leads first to an opening for a feminist
agenda]{.underline}, and [then to a narrowing]{.underline} down [of the
feminist focus and]{.underline} feminist [voices, to]{.underline}
eventually [losing the focus on gender and gender equality
altogether.]{.underline} This logic functions through mechanisms of
power. Both goals are not equally powerful, as they have unequal support
and resources within the regular organizations that are the relevant
context of gender mainstreaming. Especially when gender mainstreaming is
conceptualized in a technocratic way, less external pressure or
mobilization of feminist groups is to be expected. \[End Page 360\]
Moreover, this inequality of support and resources hinders a clear
articulation of a feminist goal, or the expression of particular
feminist goals that are seen as more radical, while such radical goals
would be needed in view of the watering-down mechanisms. [Mainstream
liberal feminism hence has an advantage, while a goal that is
articulated as a need to displace gender will meet
resistance.]{.underline} Finally, [within feminism there are hegemonic
processes as well that are not recognized and that lead to the exclusion
of certain feminist voices.]{.underline}

ethics of care provides a key contribution because it takes stock of the
experiences of the people at the receiving end of feminist foreign
policy. In contrast with orthodox foreign policy practice and theory,
which tends to disregard the lived histories of women and colonial
subjects, an ethics of care approach would actively seek to uncover
their stories to enable intersectional and situated analyses of foreign
policy.]{.underline} [This involves investigating whether states and
other actors actually employ care and empathy as a normative ideal in
their pursuit of foreign, security, defence and development
policies]{.underline}. **[States tend to vary in their commitment to
such dialogue, but this does not mean that a global ethics of care
should be dismissed in the context of foreign and security policy
analysis]{.underline}**. Instead a critical analysis of [feminist-
oriented foreign policy should seek to address the ethical question how
our view of security in global politics would change o]{.underline}nce
we recognize and accept \... the ways responsibilities and practices of
care grow out of relations of dependence and vulnerability of people in
the context of complex webs of relations of responsibility.63 [This
entails exploring to what extent the makers of feminist foreign policy
take note of 'the everyday' a]{.underline}nd whether Robison's notion of
'a feminist ethics of security' which centres on 'marginalised sites'
has some resonance with actual policy-making.64 [Ethics of care as
foreign policy conduct is often expressed in notions of gender-just
protection of such marginalised groups, in particular, the protection of
women and children from gendered violence and
discrimination.]{.underline} Here ethics of care scholar Joan Tronto
highlights the shift in global relations from what previously was a
'right to intervene' and sovereign-based logic to 'the responsibility to
protect' and an ethics of global care.65 We propose here that
protection, though at times requiring military means, should always rest
on the act of listening to marginalised voices -- a diplomatic tool that
is key to the successful conduct of feminist foreign policy. [A foreign
policy, which builds on the ethics of care as its foundation, rests on
the idea of inclusive and ethical dialogues as well as acts of listening
across borders and intersectional confines]{.underline}. Virginia Held
holds that [emotions, such as empathy, sensitivity and responsiveness,
are sentiments that need to be cultivated as a significant element when
**making moral decisions**.6]{.underline}6 [Central to the analysis of
feminist foreign policy then is the extent to which care, the act of
listening and dialogical engagement **really are key norms in the
implementation of gender-just external relations**?]{.underline} Here we
find Christine Sylvester's67 concept of empathetic cooperation
particularly useful and closely associ- ated with the ethics of care.68
[Empathetic cooperation challenges sovereign rights and national
interests as the sole platforms for international interactions in favour
of empathy across intersectional and ethical boundaries]{.underline}.
Laura Sjoberg also suggests that [emphatic cooperation is a fruitful
platform for the development of a feminist international security ethic,
which pays attention to care and justice as well as the gendered
structures that have led to the marginalisation of vulnerable
groups]{.underline} across international society.69 It may also lead to
'a form of knowledge of other persons that draws explicitly on the
commonalty of feelings and experiences to enrich one's understanding of
another in his or her own right'.70 If empathy is an expressed
willingness and ability to appreciate the other then empathetic
cooperation is 'a process of positional slippage that occurs when one
listens seriously to the concerns, fears and agendas of those one is
unaccustomed to hearing'.71 In short, we argue that [empathetic
cooperation,]{.underline} as part of the making of a feminist for- eign
policy, [may be a way of opening up for a global ethic and concrete
expressions of politics, which do not privilege statist interests and
notions of security]{.underline}. Moreover, [it moves the agenda towards
human security while respecting cultural difference.]{.underline}72
Thus, to explore the presence of empathetic cooperation in the conduct
of feminist and gender- based foreign policy is key to the analysis of
feminist foreign policy and to ethical inves- tigations into ethically
minded foreign policy more broadly.

### Arms=Femicide

#### That causes femicide -- firearms are a key factor

**Nowak 12** (Matthias Nowak, SAS researcher, "[Femicide: A Global
Problem" Small Arms Survey]{.underline},
<http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-14.pdf)//ICH-EC>

About 66, 000 women and girls are violently killed every year,
accounting for approximately 17 per cent of all victims of intentional
homicides. While [the data]{.underline} on which these conservative
estimates are based is incomplete, it [does reveal certain patterns with
respect to the male v. female victim ratio in homicides]{.underline},
intimate partner violence, **[and the use of firearms in
femicides]{.underline}**--- defined here as 'the killing of a woman'.
This Research Note examines lethal forms of violence against women. 1 It
relies on the disaggregated data on femicides produced for the Global
Burden of Armed Violence 2011 (Alvazzi del Frate, 2011, p. 113). **[The
gendered dimension of homicide]{.underline}** When it was coined by the
feminist movement in the 1970s, the term femicide referred exclu -
sively to the gender-based killing of women by men. Since then, however,
its definition has broadened to encompass any killing of a woman (see
Box 1) Data collection on femicide---in its broader sense---is
increasingly taking place at the national and sub-national levels. On
the basis of such statistics, the Small Arms Survey cre - ated one of
the most comprehensive databases on female victims of homicide to date,
covering 56 per cent of the world's female population in 111 countries
and territories for the period 2004 --09 (Alvazzi del Frate, 2011, p.
116). Still, information on many countries is missing and challenges to
comprehensive data collection persist, including definitions
discrepancies, limited capacity and resources, and a lack of detail in
statistical records. [Global patterns of femicide]{.underline} The
global extent of femicide is estimated at approximately 66 ,000 victims
per year for the period 2004 --09 . 2 This figure represents about 17
per cent or almost one-fifth of all homicide victims (396 ,000 deaths)
for an average year (Geneva Declaration Secretariat, 2011, p. 7). Map 1
reveals the global distribution of femi - cides, expressed as a rate per
100 ,000 female population for an average year between 2004 and 2009 . 3
More than half of the 25 countries with high and very high femicide
rates (at least 3 femicides per 100,000 female population) are in the
Americas: 4 in the Caribbean, 4 in Central America, and 6 in South
America. The regions with the highest femicide levels largely correspond
to the regions with the highest overall rates of lethal violence
(Alvazzi del Frate, 2011, p. 119). Indeed, four out of five regions with
the highest homicide rates also feature at the top of the femicide
ranking, namely---in descending order---Southern Africa, South America,
the Caribbean, and Central America. Meanwhile, femicide rates in Eastern
Europe and the Russian Federation appear disproportionally high with
respect to homicides in general. Regional and country-level femicide
rates can obscure significant variations at the subnational level. In
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, for example, the 2009 femicide rate was 19 . 1
per 100,000 female population, whereas the national average femicide
rate was 2 . 5 per 100 ,000 in 2004 --09. Similarly, Brazil records a
national rate of 4 .3 femicides per 100 ,000 women, yet the state of
Espíritu Santo registered 10 . 9 per 100,000 in 2008. Settings with
particularly high femicide rates also exhibit high levels of tolerance
of violence against women; moreover, their criminal justice systems tend
to be inefficient and lack the resources---or political will---needed to
fully investigate and prosecute femicide cases (Alvazzi del Frate, 2011,
p. 122). [The following sections discuss femicide in the contexts of
male v. female victim ratio in homicides; intimate partner violence
(IPV); and the use of firearms in lethal violence against
women.]{.underline} Homicide victims: women v. men As noted above,
countries with the highest levels of homicide generally show the highest
rates of lethal violence against women. However, the ratios of male to
female homicide victims across countries reveal a different trend. In
Figure 1, the line shows the rate of femicide per 100,000 women across
five categories of overall homicide rates (from very low to very high)
in 83 countries; the bars indicate the number of femicide victims for
every 100 male homicide victims in the same five categories. In the 13
countries with very low overall homicide rates, about 66 women are
killed for every 100 men. In contrast, in countries affected by high and
very high levels of homicide, the disparity between the sexes is
significantly greater at 16.3 and 12.5 women per 100 men, respectively.
In other words, [as the homicide rate increases, the number of women
killed in comparison to men appears to decrease. Yet whereas men are up
to ten times more likely than women to become victims of a homicide in
countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, women
are by no means safer in these settings]{.underline} than elsewhere;
indeed, these countries witnessed the highest femicide rates of the
period under review (Alvazzi del Frate, 2011, p. 123). The [highest
femicide rates can be observed in countries]{.underline} and territories
[affected by high or very high overall homicide rates]{.underline} (see
Figure 2). With a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 people, El Salvador is the
country with the highest femicide rate, followed by Jamaica (10.9),
Guatemala (9.7), and South Africa (9.6). In countries marked by high
levels of lethal violence, [women are more frequently attacked in the
public sphere, including by gangs and organized criminal
groups]{.underline}; in this context, femicides often take place in a
general climate of indifference and impunity. Intimate partner violence
[The majority of perpetrators of femicides are male]{.underline},
frequently family members or friends of the victim, and often a current
or former intimate partner. The close relationship between perpetrators
and victims can sometimes facilitate identification of the author of the
crime. A sample study of 54 countries and territories providing
information on relationships between perpetrators and victims of
femicide reveals that the proportion of IPV-related lethal violence is
rather low in countries with high femicide rates. For example, in El
Salvador and Colombia, which feature among the countries with the
highest femicide rates, only three per cent of all femicides are
committed by a current or former intimate partner, whereas in Cyprus,
France, and Portugal (all countries with low or very low femicide rates)
killings of women by former and current partners account for more than
80 per cent of all cases (Alvazzi del Frate, 2011, pp. 129--30).
Strikingly, the majority of IPVrelated femicide victims experienced
prior violence and physical abuse from the same perpetrator (Campbell et
al., 2003, p. 1091). [IPV-related victimization often leads to
self-directed violence.]{.underline} In the United States, for example,
35 to 40 per cent of victims who survived domestic violence attempted to
commit suicide at some point during or after the termination of the
abusive relationship. Research conducted in the European Union reveals
that of all cases of deaths occurring in the wake of spousal violence,
42 per cent were due to suicide (Psytel, 2010, pp. 9--10). [Firearms
Firearms play an important role in lethal violence. The Global Burden of
Armed Violence 2008 estimates that on average 60 per cent of all
homicides are committed with firearms]{.underline} (Geneva Declaration
Secretariat, 2008, p. 5). The display of firearms---as a means to
intimidate, threaten, or coerce someone---is a predictor of their actual
use. [**Many women report having been threatened with a firearm before
they fall victim to a femicide**. Firearms in the home similarly
represent an increased risk to women as they are more likely to be used
to threaten and inflict harm on family members]{.underline} than to
protect the home from intruders (Alvazzi del Frate, 2011, p. 131).
[Analysis]{.underline} of a sample of 24 countries with detailed data on
the type of weapons used in committing femicides [**reveals a direct
correlation between femicide rates and the use of firearms.**
Specifically, countries affected by high levels of femicide exhibit a
higher proportion of femicides committed with firearms.]{.underline} On
average, firearms were used in one-third of all femicides worldwide; in
Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, however,
firearms were used in more than 60 per cent of femicides (Alvazzi del
Frate, 2011, p. 131). The highest percentage of firearm-related
femicides was observed in 2009 in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where firearms
were used in more than 80 per cent of all femicides---almost as high a
percentage as for firearm homicides with male victims (p. 132).

#### Arms act as a conduit for societal constructions of masculinity to manifest in gender-based violence 

**GD 8** (Geneva Declaration, diplomatic initiative aimed at addressing
the interrelations between armed violence and development. "Armed
Violence Against Women," Global Burden of Armed Violence, Geneva
Declaration, 2008,
<http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/GBAV/GBAV08-CH6.pdf>)//Bennerz

The gender dimensions of armed violence [Different experiences of armed
violence are determined by gender roles.]{.underline} Gender (as opposed
to sex) refers to the construction of social roles that operate through
various mechanisms, such as institutions or stereotypes. [Gender
constructions reflect deeply rooted relations of power and determine the
roles, behaviour, values, and relationships associated with masculinity
and femininity. These are the roles and behaviour that a man or a woman
is expected to adopt in a given setting]{.underline}. These roles vary
between and within different cultures and are learnt behaviour acquired
through socialization (Connell, 1995, p. 44). [A gender approach is
useful to account for the different ways in which armed violence affects
women and men]{.underline}. [Focusing on gender rather than women allows
one to include gender-based violence against men and boys as well as
gay, lesbian, transgender, and transsexual people**. This is important
because violence is not only used by men to claim and assert power over
women**]{.underline}, **[but it is also instrumental in enforcing the
gender hierarchy of power among men]{.underline}**. A gender-sensitive
approach highlights the power relations inherent in much armed violence.
Finally, **[such an approach does not limit women to the role of victims
and men to the role of perpetrators]{.underline}**, [since it recognizes
that women can also be the perpetrators of armed violence, while men are
also among the victims. Gendered power relations and forms of violent
masculinities are key underlying factors shaping the dynamics of armed
violence. In many societies, violence and weapons use by boys and men
are socially expected or accepted]{.underline} (Widmer, Barker, and
Buchanan, 2006). [Boys are socialized into violent behaviour through
weapon-related rites of passage from boyhood to manhood]{.underline}

her eye and exited behind her ear. Abunduruk, Sudan, near the Chadian
border. © Lynsey Addario ARMED VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 1111245673
(Myrttinen, 2003, p. 38). The media and popular culture often link
violence, arms, and masculinity, reinforcing images of conventional
gender roles. In some cases [violence becomes an expression of
masculinity]{.underline}. There is, however, not just one form of
masculinity and femininity in any given society: different types of
masculinities exist and are interlinked by relationships of power,
hierarchy, and exclusion. [The hierarchy of different forms of
masculinity is an important source of conflict and violence among men,
as challenges to one's masculinity are common sources of disputes and
injuries or even murder]{.underline} (Connell, 2003, pp. 1--2). [Gang
turf wars, for example, are often linked to honour-related issues and
challenges to 'status', 'toughness', and 'manhood']{.underline}.
Perceived threats to one's masculinity can also arise from economic
dislocation, unemployment, or social transformations. In societies where
the male gender role is intricately tied to being the main
'breadwinner', unemployment can leave men feeling 'emasculated' and
powerless, and wanting to demonstrate that they are 'real men' (Widmer,
Barker, and Buchanan, 2006, p. 3). [The resort to armed violence is
often linked to a crisis of masculinity and a 'fear of loss of power and
privilege']{.underline} (Messner, 1990) through social transformations.
[Weapons can also be used as status symbols, as tools to achieve
economic and social gain, or to acquire power over unarmed persons in
order to reassert one's masculinity]{.underline} (Myrttinen, 2003, p.
37). [Although men are the main perpetrators of acts of armed violence,
women and children also use armed violence]{.underline} (Bennett,
Bexley, and Warnock, 1995). During the armed conflict in El Salvador,
for example, women held 40 per cent of leadership and 30 per cent of
combatant roles (Schroeder, 2005, p. 1), and women and girls are
involved in gangs in Haiti (OTHER FORMS OF ARMED VIOLENCE). In the armed
conflict in Liberia, child soldiers as young as nine years old
reportedly committed killings and atrocities often under the influence
of drugs and alcohol used to induce aggression and suppress fear (HRW,
2004, pp. 2--3). [Gender roles influence not only who perpetrates armed
violence but also who becomes the victim.]{.underline} This is
especially so with gender-based violence, 'an umbrella term for any harm
that is perpetrated against a person's will, and that results from power
inequities that are based on gender roles' (RHRC, 2003, p. 9).
[Gender-based violence may be physical, sexual, psychological, economic,
or sociocultural, such as intimate partner violence, sexual assault,
honour killings, dowry-related violence, or trafficking]{.underline}.
Categories of perpetrators include intimate partners, family members,
community members, and those acting on behalf of cultural, religious, or
state actors. The distinction between victim and perpetrator of
gender-based violence does not necessarily follow gender fault lines:
while men are the main perpetrators, women also commit acts of
genderbased violence, and even though women are the main victims, men,
boys, and transgender/transsexual people are also among the victims.
Forms of gender-based violence specifically directed against men include
sex-selective killings, forced conscription, and sexual violence
(Carpenter, 2006). For example, in the armed conflicts of the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
numerous cases of sexual violence against men and boys were reported
(INDIRECT CONFLICT DEATHS). Among non-combatants in the former
Yugoslavia, adult civilian men were the most likely to be massacred by
enemy forces (Carpenter, 2003). Such sex-selective killings of GLOBAL
BURDEN of ARMED VIOLENCE 112 men are rooted in the assumptions of male
wartime roles, reproducing gendered hierarchies (Carpenter, 2006, pp.
88--89). The experience of armed violence is influenced not only by
gender but also by other factors, such as age, race, ethnicity, class,
or religion. During the civil war in Guatemala, for example, women and
children of ethnic Mayan origin were specifically targeted (Commission
for Historical Clarification, 1999, §85--88, §91). In the Rwandan
genocide, sex-selective killings targeted specifically Tutsi men,
whereas Tutsi women frequently became the victims of sexual violence
(Carpenter, 2006, p. 89; Ward, 2002; HRW, 1996). [Acts of gender-based
violence do not necessarily involve the use of weapons]{.underline}.
**[However, arms are often directly or indirectly linked to violence,
either through their presence or as the indirect consequences of armed
violence]{.underline}**. **[Surveys have shown, for example, that the
presence of a gun in the household generally increases threefold the
risk of becoming a homicide victim]{.underline}** (Kellermann et al.,
1993). [Attitudes and roles shaped by armed violence, for example
through army training or the experiences of war, also contribute to
gender-based violence.]{.underline} A study on domestic violence in
Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that men returning from war face a
'masculinity crisis', which increases the likelihood of male violence
and the abuse of women (CARE and ICRW, 2007, p. 8).

### Unpaid Labor

#### Violence via small arms magnifies the unpaid labor placed onto women in post-conflict settings

**Farr 02**

**(Vanessa A. Farr, African Women's Anti-War Coalition, A Gendered
Analysis of International Agreements on Small Arms and Light Weapons, in
Brief 24: Gender Perspectives on Small Arms and Light Weapons, Bonn
International Center for Conversion, July 2002,
http://www.seesac.org/f/tmp/files/failovi/210.pdf#page=25, JKS)**

**[Women's unpaid labor and firearm-related violence]{.underline}**

[A final blow to women's sharing in peaceful development after war
arises from the proliferation and abuse of small arms and light weapons
in the post-conflict era.]{.underline} Again, [women are affected in two
ways: firstly, by a rise in levels of domestic violence involving small
arms, which comes about because the vast majority of gun owners are men
and much of the violence that is encouraged in times of war is
transferred to the domestic sphere when conflicts formally
end]{.underline} (Cukier 2000; De Abreu, 1998). Secondly, [when small
arms and light weapons continue to circulate freely, causing on-going
casualties, it falls to women not only to care for the injured but also
to protect the vulnerable]{.underline}. [Women bear the heaviest burden
of nursing the casualties of gun-related violence back to health or
taking care of those who have become permanently disabled.]{.underline}
Whether at home or as volunteers or underpaid supporters in civil
society structures that focus on the rehabilitation of victims, [their
labor subsidizes over-stretched or non-existent governmental healthcare
and legal systems.]{.underline} Their work is often dangerous if it
takes them into courtrooms to give testimony, and in the absence of
witness protection programs or an efficient judicial system, [women may
also have to shield survivors from their attempted killers]{.underline}.
Often, [women affected by ongoing gun violence take on the
responsibility to organize opposition rallies, marches, petitions and
other such forms of public protest against the proliferation of
SALW]{.underline}.6 In South Africa, for example, where more than thirty
five people a day die from gunshot wounds, Gun Free South Africa
organized a huge rally on Women's Day, 8 March 2000, to say "Women Say
No to Gun Violence." They were urging the government to put into
practice a new Firearms Control Act, which was passed in October 2000
but is still in the process of implementation. [All of this work is
highly stressful, takes time from other productive labor, and yet, like
much of women's work, goes unrecognized and unrewarded]{.underline}. It
can also make women feel even more vulnerable, since those who work in
organizations that oppose gun proliferation and misuse often become the
specific targets of anger from men who support gun ownership.

### Death Toll

#### Small arms have the highest death toll of *[any weapon system]{.underline}*

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

The focus on national military means as the basis of security gave rise
to arms races that had the potential of causing more insecurity. [Arms
races are action-reaction phenomena whereby countries locked in
political conflict steadily augment their military capabilities in
response to a perceived growth in each other's military
preparations.]{.underline} [Thus arms races paradoxically leads to more
insecurity]{.underline}, what Jervis (1978) and Posen (1993) refer to as
[the "security dilemma."]{.underline}20 Simply put, a security dilemma
exists [when the actions of one state, in trying to increase its own
security causes a reaction in a second state, which, in the end,
decreases its]{.underline} (the first state\'s) [own
security.]{.underline} It is against this background that arms control
and disarmament were pursued. A [number of arms regulation treaties
aimed at cementing the relaxation of international tensions]{.underline}
such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) which bans the development, possession
and use of chemical weapons has eliminated an entire class of weapons
were concluded. Since the end of the Cold War, [the diminishing
possibility of a nuclear war has increasing shifted international
attention to problems arising from the worldwide proliferation of small
arms and light weapons.]{.underline} This is partly because **[these
weapons have been the primary tools of violence in the many ethnic and
internal conflicts that have erupted in recent years and the
re-conceptualisation of security that has taken place]{.underline}**.
This importance was underlined by the UN secretary-general's October
2000 'We the People' millennium speech to the General Assembly in which
he states, **[The death toll from small arms dwarfs that of all other
weapons systems]{.underline}** - and in most years greatly exceeds the
toll of the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In
terms of the carnage they cause, [small arms, indeed, could well be
described as '**weapons of mass destruction**.]{.underline}' [Small arms
proliferation]{.underline} is not merely a security issue; it [is also
an issue of human rights and of development]{.underline}. The
proliferation of [small arms sustains and exacerbates armed conflicts.
It endangers peacekeepers and humanitarian workers. It undermines
respect for international humanitarian law. It threatens legitimate but
weak governments and it benefits terrorists as well as the perpetrators
of organised crime]{.underline}.21

### Conflict- Generic

#### Small arms are *[uniquely likely]{.underline}* to contribute to and create conflicts

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

Small arms and conflict It has been argued that "[the massive quantities
of small arms in circulation have been primary contributors to a
world-wide epidemic of ethnic, sectarian, and criminal
violence]{.underline}."31 Although weapons themselves do not cause
conflicts, [their proliferation and easy availability exacerbate the
degree of violence by increasing the lethality and duration of
hostilities, and encouraging violent rather than peaceful resolutions of
differences.]{.underline}32 As Harting observes, Guns don't kill people,
but societies awash in guns are far more likely to resolve their
differences violently, in ways that can quickly spiral out of control.
Once this happens, the international community can neither stop the
killing nor heal societal wounds inflicted by militias, warlords,
criminal gangs or repressive governments.33 [Small arms and light
weapons have certain characteristics that make them the most widely used
weapons by countries and groups involved in armed conflict: They are
cheap, wide availability, highly lethal, simple to use, durable,
portable and can be easily concealed]{.underline}. [They are also
germane to military, police, and civilian use]{.underline}.34 Available
data indicate that [SALW are the major weapons used in today's
conflicts]{.underline}. Out [of the forty-nine major
conflicts]{.underline} fought in the 1990s, [small arms were the only
armaments used in forty-six conflicts.]{.underline}35 Furthermore, [SALW
were the dominant weapons used in the 95 internal conflicts]{.underline}
that were fought around the world between 1989-1996.36 [The availability
of light weapons has also transformed the very nature of conflict from
traditional combat between nation-states to intra-state conflict
involving a wide variety of actors, including governments, rebel
movements, militias, ethnic and religious groups, tribes and clans,
refugees, criminal gangs and mercenaries]{.underline}.37 Further still
[the consequences of violence perpetrated with small arms extend **well
beyond the direct effects of a single bullet**]{.underline}. **[The mere
threat of armed attack compels civilians to alter their behavior in an
attempt to minimise the associated risks to both themselves and their
families]{.underline}**.38 [The presence of SALW acts as a **magnifier
of violence**]{.underline}, both in conflict and non-conflict
situations. Social groups, including [children and women who have
usually been outside the traditional patterns of conflict, find
themselves caught up in a new, more threatening
environment]{.underline}. In addition, [small arms have contributed to a
"**culture of violence**"]{.underline} characterized by gun dependency
and their glorification.

### HR Violations

#### SALW facilitate heinous human rights violations

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

Small arms and human rights abuse **[The proliferation of SALW is
largely responsible for the violation of humanitarian
laws]{.underline}**. According to the International Committee of the Red
Cross, "[the proliferation of weapons in the hands of new and often
undisciplined actors has outpaced efforts to ensure compliance with the
basic rules of warfare]{.underline}" [resulting in]{.underline}
"[appalling levels of wanton violence and a stream of horrific images
**which threaten to immunise the public and decision makers to ongoing
violations** of international humanitarian law]{.underline}".39 Although
a study by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) shows
that weapons availability posed a grave threat to the security of
civilians, and indeed the entire humanitarian enterprise, it however,
emphasised that a causal relationship between the availability of small
arms and human rights violations or the use of violence against the
civil population, is not proven. 40 The Human rights Watch thinks
otherwise. In a briefing Paper for the UN Biennial Meeting entitled
Small Arms Small Arms and Human Rights: The Need for Global Action Human
Rights Watch argues that the [uncontrolled proliferation and widespread
misuse of small arms represents **a global human rights crisis by
facilitating countless human rights abuses** and violations of
international humanitarian law]{.underline}. [Small arms-aided abuses by
either governments or private actors occur in wartime, post-conflict
settings, and in countries not at war]{.underline}. [These violations
include the deliberate targeting of civilians or other non-combatants,
and indiscriminate attacks likely to disproportionately harm civilians
and torture]{.underline}. [In post conflict situations the widespread
availability of small arms has **greatly added to the death
toll**]{.underline}. Particularly where security is weak, [former
combatants have not been disarmed, and abusive actors have not been held
accountable for past behaviour, a situation of lawlessness can emerge
where civilians are at grave risk.]{.underline} Even in countries
nominally at peace, the misuse of small arms accounts for many serious
human rights abuses. **[Small arms confer power, even without being
fired]{.underline}**. [**The coercive potential of these weapons**, when
exploited by abusive government agents, **can enable human rights abuses
such as torture, rape, intimidation, and looting.**]{.underline}41

### Crime

#### SALW are used for crime

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

SALW and crime It is often assumed that [there is a relationship between
small arms, their misuse, and levels of armed criminality]{.underline}.
However, perspectives differ on whether easy access to weapons increases
or decreases crime. One view is that small arms possession serves as a
deterrent leading to improved personal security and a reduction in
interpersonal crime. Proponents of this view assume that small arms
possession in controlled circumstances serves as a micro-deterrent to
would-be criminals. Another view is that [small arms availability,
ownership, and portability are linked to a **greater incidence of
violent death**]{.underline} ([e.g. homicide, suicide, and unintentional
death]{.underline}), [interpersonal violence, intimidation, and
criminality.]{.underline} Accordingly, [more firearms equal more violent
crime.]{.underline}59 Nevertheless, the [proliferation SALW is said to
be]{.underline} partly [responsible for the rise in criminal acts such
as armed robberies, hijacking, terrorism, stealing of livestock, drug
trafficking, and smuggling.]{.underline} Armed robbery and other indices
of crime in developed countries are estimated to have increased
dramatically since the late 1960s. The rate of intentional homicide
increased by 50 per cent between 1980 and 1990 in Latin America and
Africa, and more than 100 per cent in eastern Europe and central Asia.60
In East Africa, the International Police (Interpol) sub-regional bureau
in Nairobi reports that small arms are the common denominator in the
commission of the five major crimes in the region: terrorism, cattle
rustling, firearms trafficking, drug trafficking and motor vehicle
theft.61 In Kenya, gun-related incidents in the country rose by 200% in
1995 (most recent available figures) over the previous year."62
According to police reports, "the proliferation of illegal weapons is
probably the most significant contributing factor to crime in the
country... [Unlike in the past, there is use of guns in almost every
robbery today]{.underline}.63 **[There is thus a relationship between
SALW proliferation and rise in criminality.]{.underline}**

### Forced Displacement

#### Small arms facilitate forced displacement

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

SALW and forced displacement [One particularly disturbing example of
the]{.underline} indirect [impacts of small arms is the forced
displacement of populations, both internally as internally displaced
people]{.underline} (IDPs) [and externally as refugees]{.underline}. At
the beginning of 2003, almost 35 million people - 13 million refugees
and 22 million internally displaced persons - remained uprooted by war
and persecution world-wide.64 **[Small arms-related intimidation and
insecurity are a key factor inhibiting sustainable repatriation or
resettlement]{.underline}**. The UNHCR has acknowledged that '[armed
conflict is now the driving force behind most refugee
flows]{.underline}'.65 The UN has repeatedly observed that 'in many
recent and current internal armed conflicts, [combatants deliberately
intimidate, attack and displace local populations to further their
pursuit of economic control over natural resources]{.underline}'. In
such cases, [combatants rely on, even profit from, civilian
displacement]{.underline}.66 The widespread use of mines, for example,
renders vast areas of territory uninhabitable. Mines are targeted at
civilian populations. Not only do they force people to flee their
homelands, but they also prevent them from return. [Arming of militias
and local factions has intensified conflict leading to forced
displacement]{.underline}. In the Sudan, for example, since the early
1990s the government increasingly relied on armed militias, especially
Arab militias, to fight the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) rebels
and its rural support on the ground thus massively widening the scope of
the war.67 The Arab militias concentrate exclusively on civilian targets
looting cattle, women and children. For example, Arab militias were
responsible for planning the massacre of 1,000 civilians on 27- 8 March
1987.68 The SPLA has responded to the militia attacks by meeting
violence with violence and in some has also targeted civilians in
retaliatory attacks.69 [Arming militias has led to the proliferation of
cheap weapons and the development of a 'kalashnikov culture', which has
increased violence and led to further flight of civilians]{.underline}.
In Somalia, following the collapse of the state, the proliferation of
[small arms resulted in the rise of militias and armed
gangs]{.underline}. Civilians became the main targets of warlords that
further led to forced population displacement. Further, small arms have
been used to violate civilians during flight, or while in camps. The
militarisation of refugee camps and populated areas and IDP camps has
resulted in insecurity not only to civilians but also to states
concerned. UNHCR recognises that curt**[ailing the sale or transfer of
small arms would contribute to greater stability and security, and would
reduce people's incentive to flee in the first place]{.underline}**.
Predictably, [household entitlements and the access of individuals to
basic needs collapse when people are forced to flee. Food security is
also undermined by the activities of armed groups.]{.underline} For
example, the threat and harassment of civilians by armed groups
constrains mobility (e.g. of farmers to their fields or traders to
markets) and trade.70

### Development

#### SALW hinder development

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

Small arms and development [The spread of SALW adversely affects
economic development by discouraging investment, divestment,
misallocation of resources to security instead of development, and
affects the implementation or initiation of development
projects]{.underline}. [Health and education provision is adversely
affected when providers work in a dangerous environment]{.underline}.
[Doctors and teachers are difficult to attract to work in areas where
they are at greater risk of being attacked.]{.underline} The
proliferation of arms will prevent development objectives from being
reached.71 It is in recognition of this that the UNDP has established a
special organization under the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery
(CPR) to deal with the SALW problem. According to the UNDP, [Where guns
dominate, development suffers, schools close, shops close, commerce
stops, and the local economy grinds to a halt. Buildings are destroyed,
bridges are blown up, and whatever development there has been, is gone.
Private investment dried up and development organizations can't
operate.]{.underline} Even after the shootings stops, there is no
security. People can't return to their homes or a normal life...72
[Humanitarian workers have noted persistent food insecurity among
households in arms-saturated areas -- even where those locations are
'benefiting' from substantial agricultural and food aid -- **indicating
a relationship between armed violence and access to basic
entitlements**]{.underline}. In Kenya, for example, services like
schooling and healthcare have deteriorated or collapsed in areas where
small arms availability and use are high. [Literacy and school enrolment
rates in arms-affected regions are well below the national
average]{.underline}.73 **[Besides arms hinder development by diverting
limited national resources to weapons purchases, especially in
developing countries.]{.underline}** In the past decade, military
spending (partly for small arms) by the poorest countries rose by 20 per
cent while dropping for the richest. Developing countries spent \$172
billion on armed forces---almost five times the official aid they
received, and 44 per cent of their expenditures on education and health
combined (compared to about 20 per cent for industrialised countries.74

### Child Soldiers

#### Small arms kill thousands of children annually 

**Mogire 04** (Edward Mogire, Professor at Kingston University. "The
humanitarian impact of small arms and light weapons and threat to
security." 15th International Amaldi Conference, Changing Threats to
Global Security: Peace or Turmoil, ISBN 9517691610, 2004, JKS +
//Bennerz)

SALW and the problem of child soldiers A number of factors are believed
to have encouraged the use of children as soldiers. Among them
technological developments and the **[proliferation of]{.underline}**
weapons, especially **[small arms, have made semi-automatic rifles light
enough and simple enough to be stripped, reassembled and used by a
child]{.underline}** of 10.75 Although the recruitment and use of
children for combat is outlawed,76 [more than 500,000 children under-18
have been recruited into state and non-state armed groups in over 85
countries]{.underline}. At any one time, more than 300,000 of these
children are actively fighting as soldiers with government armed forces
or armed opposition groups. [Child soldiers under 15 years of age are
believed to be part of non-state armed forces]{.underline}. [Those
children, who are not fighters, are typically used as runners or scouts,
porters, sex slaves, cooks or spies]{.underline}. More than half of all
armed groups in Sierra Leone's so-called children's war were under 18.
In northern Uganda, the Lord\'s Resistance Army has abducted at least
12,000 children since 1985 that are then forced to become fighters or
sex slaves. In Colombia, guerrillas, paramilitary groups and security
forces routinely recruit children for combat. [Up to 30 per cent of some
guerrilla units are made up of children. Many children are abducted,
others join voluntarily in order to survive or to avenge atrocities
committed against their family or community]{.underline}.77 In addition
**[small arms and light weapons kill thousands of children each year and
millions more die from the indirect consequences of armed
conflict]{.underline}**. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
estimates that during the 1990s, more than 2 million children died as a
result of armed conflict, and more than three times as many were
permanently disabled or seriously injured. Many children experience
emotional trauma, suffer from malnutrition and are denied access to
education.78

## \*\*Case\*\*

### AT: Alt Causes

#### Most weapons from US arms sales to Mexico funnel into the illicit market -- exacerbated by lack of end-use verification 

**Lumpe, 1999** \[Lora- senior researcher at the Peace Research
Institute in Oslo, co-author of The Arms Trade Revealed, a guide to
researching U.S. arms exports and military aid, pub-lished in 1998 by
the Federation of American Scientists, "The Leader of the Pack",
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 27-33\]

[A state\'s record of physical control over previously supplied small
arms should]{.underline} also [be considered when deciding whether to
approve export licenses or to make arms grants]{.underline}. [Many
U.S.-origin small arms enter into illegal circulation]{.underline}. [In
1994, foreign governments reported 6,238 unlawfully acquired U.S.-origin
firearms to the Bureau of Alcohol]{.underline}, To-bacco and Firearms
(BATF). [More than half-3,376---were found in Mexico]{.underline}.
According to President Clinton\'s state-ment at the signing of an
Organization of American States treaty in Novem-ber 1997, in 1996 alone
the BATF re-ceived approximately 30,000 requests to trace weapons used
in crimes. [These weapons were almost certainly sold legally in the
first place, either do-mestically or abroad, and were later transferred
to a third party in contra-vention of U.S. law]{.underline}. [The U.S.
government rarely con-ducts end-use checks on weapons it has exported,
relying instead principal-ly on good faith]{.underline}. According to an
Au-gust 1997 White House report on end-use monitoring of FMS shipments,
\"Whether a minor item, which is read-ily available commercially \[small
arms, for example\] or a high technology weap-on system, each defense
item transfer must be preceded by formal agree-ment with appropriate
end-use and re-transfer restrictions.\" \"Security Assistance Offices,\"
locat-ed in U.S. embassies around the world, are charged with in-country
manage-ment of weapons sales programs, in-cluding oversight of end use.
[However, there is no indication that any routine or surprise end-use
inspections are un-dertaken to assure physical control and
non-transfer]{.underline}. A rare congressional over-sight hearing, held
in 1994, revealed that from 1989 to 1993 [the State De-partment approved
108 licenses for the export of more than \$34 million worth of small
arms to Mexico, but per-formed only three follow-up inspec-tions to
ensure that the weapons were in the intended hands.]{.underline}

#### Legal arms sales massively outweigh low-levels of smuggling

**Blanchfield 16**

**(Patrick Blanchfield is a freelance journalist and academic. He writes
about guns, violence, and American politics and culture. Associate
Faculty at the Brooklyn Institute, and author of several books. 7-11-16,

<https://thenewinquiry.com/recoil-operation/>, JKS)**

Stories like these soak up a lot of press. Who could resist the story of
the bungled ATF "Fast and Furious" sting operation that "lost track of
hundreds of weapons that were allowed to pass into Mexico in hopes of
tracing them to cartel leaders"? [**But if our attention is drawn
towards the lurid details of small-scale smuggling, we can easily lose
sight of the big picture: the absolutely gargantuan flow of arms from
the US to Mexico.** Since Mexico has comparatively strict gun laws, an
estimated 99% of firearms are owned illegally. The majority of these
guns are smuggled from the United States: of 99,691 firearms recovered
from Mexican crime scenes 2007-2011, the ATF traced 68,161 back to US
points of origin, with a similar breakdown for 2009-2014.]{.underline}
By using more sophisticated modeling techniques, researchers estimate
that a quarter million illegal guns cross the border southwards each
year. Outrage is easy for stories about rogue soldiers smuggling guns,
but numbers like these are numbing. [And when it comes to **US-Mexico
weapons sales carried out entirely legally**, and with the blessing of
Washington, the response is mostly willful ignorance]{.underline}. [Past
Mexican administrations were often reluctant to pursue formal arms deals
with the United States, but in the last few years, there has been a
dramatic uptick in "legitimate" trade in arms with Mexico, facilitated
by the American government:]{.underline} Mexico spent only \$200 million
on US military hardware in 2001, but its military spending topped \$1.15
billion in 2014 alone (and the trend line is marked[). In 2014, the
\$21.6 million that Mexican authorities spent on **American small
arms**---primarily M-16s and M-4s---**represented one of the largest
single foreign military sales of such arms in the past fifteen
years**.]{.underline} If the details of these sales are reported, they
are taken to mark the deepening, inter-American partnership in the war
on drugs. Photo after photo of drug kingpin being perp-walked (by
Mexican forces toting US-made rifles) are presented as visible evidence
of victories in that crusade. Victory is just around the corner;
progress is on the march. Meanwhile, over the last decade, the Mexican
police and military have acquired a habit of "losing" an average of 3.5
firearms per day, as the toll in bodies continues to climb.

### AT: Other Weapons Exist

#### Small arms are easier to transfer and conceal

**Blanchfield 16**

**(Patrick Blanchfield is a freelance journalist and academic. He writes
about guns, violence, and American politics and culture. Associate
Faculty at the Brooklyn Institute, and author of several books. 7-11-16,
Recoil Operation, The New Inquiry,
<https://thenewinquiry.com/recoil-operation/>, JKS)**

Against such rhetoric, [the figures are stark]{.underline}. In the first
five years of President Obama's tenure, government-approved arms sales
topped the total sum of those concluded during both terms of the George
W. Bush administration by more than \$30 billion dollars. Adjusted for
inflation, Obama's presided (in just five years!) over more arms sales
than any US administration since World War II. From 2010 to 2015,
foreign purchases of US military hardware rose 118%, and budget requests
for grants to subsidize foreign purchases show no sign of slowing down.
Admittedly, much of this increase in sales has been in direct response
to the foreign policy misadventures of the previous administration. [But
this gets at a key point: unlike, say, jet fighters, helicopters, or
guided missiles, small arms are low-maintenance, incredibly cheap, and
easy to store, transfer, and conceal. Thus, they tend to wander from the
hands of a given allied nation's establishment "arms bourgeoisie". Small
arms are easily seized and turned to new uses.]{.underline} After all,
the lethality of ISIS fighters in Syria and Iraq has been dramatically
magnified by their possession of thousands of M-16s and M-4s that the US
originally sold to the Iraqi army. Some of these are now available for
sale to the highest bidder, on Iraqi Facebook groups.

### UQ- Deregulation Coming

#### Now is key- Trump will deregulate small arms exports

**Fandos**, **1-31**-2019 -- Nicholas, reporter in the Washington bureau
of The New York Times, covering Congress ("Trump Administration Eases
Regulations on Gun Exports, Raising Concerns",
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/gun-exports-trump.html)//mba-cwk

WASHINGTON --- [American gun manufacturers and their allies have pressed
the federal government for years to change the way it regulates
small-arms exports in an effort to ease restrictions, boost gun sales
abroad and lower costs at home. The Trump administration appears to be
on the brink of delivering.]{.underline} Officials from [the State and
Commerce Departments]{.underline} --- the two entities tasked with
regulating arms sales internationally --- privately told Congress this
week that they [intend to finalize rules]{.underline} next week [that
would shuffle which agency oversees most consumer gun exports, relaxing
export regulations and oversight, according to congressional aides
familiar with the plans]{.underline}. Once Congress receives formal
notification of the rule change, lawmakers will have 30 days to decide
whether to intervene or let the new rules take effect. Under the
changes, many American [gun and ammunition manufacturers that sell
primarily to consumers would no longer be required to register with the
State Department, which currently licenses international arms sales, or
to pay the department an annual fee. Instead, those sales would be
licensed by the Commerce Department, which has a simpler process and
does not charge a fee.]{.underline} The changes are almost certain to
provoke resistance from some Democratic lawmakers, who fear that lighter
regulation will lead to a proliferation of American guns, including
AR-15s and similar semiautomatic rifles frequently used in mass
shootings, around the world and exacerbate illegal arms trafficking.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, has such strong concerns that he plans to
place a hold on the new rule --- a step that his staff believes could
effectively bar it being carried out for a period of time to allow for
negotiations over his objections. But [blocking the changes permanently
would be exceedingly difficult]{.underline}. [It would require an act of
Congress and, therefore, the overwhelming support of congressional
Republicans, who generally back changes that will lessen regulations on
businesses, especially gun manufacturers.]{.underline} Though many
liberal lawmakers now oppose the plan, the push to streamline government
controls on American arms exports began under President Barack Obama to
promote export opportunities for American companies and refocus
regulatory attention on sales that could pose national security risks.
The rule to move commercial gun export licenses to the Commerce
Department was nearly complete when a gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in late 2012, killing 26 people,
most of them children. Though the proposal was not related to domestic
gun control, Mr. Obama's administration delayed the rule-making process
and never reopened it. Mr. Trump's campaign to pare back federal
regulations across the government revived the issue. He formally
proposed a rule change virtually identical to Mr. Obama's last May and
has subsequently incorporated public comments. The meeting between
administration and congressional officials this week was meant to draw
that process to a close. [Among the items being transferred to the
Commerce Department's jurisdiction are semiautomatic and single-shot
firearms, as well as a range of parts and components. The State
Department will continue to license sales of items that serve "a
critical military advantage or perform an inherently military function,"
including automatic weapons. In moving jurisdiction of certain sales
from the State Department to the Commerce Department, Congress will lose
an oversight lever that it covets and has relied on in high-profile
cases in the past. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the State
Department is required to submit information on any commercial arms sale
worth \$1 million or more to congressional review. The Commerce
Department has no such requirement.]{.underline} That lack of visibility
is high among Mr. Menendez's concerns. Democrats also believe [the
changes have implications for the proliferation of blueprints for 3-D
printed guns online]{.underline} and could undercut a federal lawsuit
brought by several state attorneys general to block such blueprints from
being shared online. "I think it's the beginning of the Trump
administration trying to move a series of different sales that are
generally considered arms sales into a more commercial category," Mr.
Menendez said in a brief interview on Thursday. "That's not good." In
the House, where Democrats hold the majority and could conceivably pass
a bill to block the change, Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York,
the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will most likely
hold a hearing on the proposed changes. And at least one House Democrat,
Representative Norma J. Torres of California, has introduced legislation
in the past to block the proposed shift and keep oversight
responsibilities with the State Department. A spokeswoman for Ms. Torres
said she planned to reintroduce the measure in the coming days. The
changes, the congresswoman wrote last year, "could be a boon for illegal
weapons traffickers and their unsavory customers --- from ISIS to
Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel." Proponents say Democrats are being hyperbolic
and point out that there were few objections on the left when Mr. Obama
proposed his own rule. A State Department official, speaking anonymously
to discuss a rule that has not been finalized, stressed that arms
transferred to the Commerce Department's purview will still be subject
to strict licensing requirements and a review by multiple American
agencies, including the State Department. The official said the changes
are meant to prioritize the control of military grade or other arms that
pose national security concerns rather than commercial items. The change
would also cut costs for businesses. Lawrence Keane of the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, one of the leading advocates for the new
rules, predicted they would make "American companies more competitive
internationally without diminishing national security." "Why would you
not do that?" he added.

#### Small arms are moving to the CCL to remove Congressional oversight

**Chang**, 12-20-20**17** -- Thomas Buergenthal Scholar at The George
Washington University Law School ("By Weakening Arms Export Controls,
Trump's National Security Strategy Will Create National and Global
Insecurity",
https://www.justsecurity.org/49873/weakening-arms-export-controls-trumps-national-security-strategy-create-national-global-insecurity/)//mba-cwk

The [Trump]{.underline} [administration's review of US arms export
controls includes proposals to weaken specific export controls over a
diverse array of weaponry ranging from small arms to drones. In short,
the Trump administration intends to change export regulations so that
gun manufacturers can export without adequate background checks on the
countries or security forces purchasing them]{.underline}, even as we
mourn the victims of gun violence linked to the inadequacy of background
checks here in the US It has been reported that the [Trump
administration intends to shift some gun and small arms sales from the
US Munitions List to the Commerce Control List soon, with reports
indicating that the administration is close to finalizing proposed new
rules]{.underline}. Although advocacy and reporting on this proposal
have been hindered by a lack of transparency, this has not stopped a
small group of dedicated arms control advocates from highlighting that
[the anticipated changes are likely to remove Congressional notification
requirements for arms sales, remove State Department oversight that
ensures these exports take into account national security, foreign
policy and human rights considerations, and ultimately make it much
easier for small arms manufacturers to obtain licenses to sell abroad,
with less accountability if the guns end up in the wrong
hands.]{.underline}

#### Proposed deregulations of arms exports make human rights abuses much harder to counter

**Hartung**, 7-15-20**18** -- William, director of the Arms and Security
Project at the Center for International Policy ("Trump's arms export
rules will undermine US security and risk human rights abuses",
<https://thehill.com/opinion/international/397096-trumps-arms-export-rules-will-undermine-us-security-promote-human)//mba-cwk>

This was the last week for public comments on the Trump administration's
plan to reduce restrictions on the export of firearms from the United
States. There was much to criticize. A number of arms control, human
rights, and firearms safety groups have submitted detailed critiques of
the proposed firearms export rule. As Reps. Sander Levin (D-Mich.),
Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), James McGovern (D-Mass.), Norma Torres (D-Calif.)
and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) noted in a recent letter [to Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross it would be a mistake
to move regulation of dangerous firearms from the State Department to
the less restrictive Department of Commerce.]{.underline} The lawmakers
warned [the Trump plan as proposed would make it more likely that
weapons of U.S. origin "will end up in the hands of traffickers,
terrorists, and cartels." The new rule may be good news for the firearms
industry, but it is bad news for anyone who is concerned about human
rights and global security. One major flaw in the new plan is that it
would eliminate notifications to Congress of exports of firearms and
related equipment worth \$1 million or more]{.underline}. [Statistics
gathered by the Security Assistance Monitor have documented that the
State Department approved \$662 million worth of firearms exports to 15
countries in 2017, including to places like Mexico, Honduras, El
Salvador, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey where
there is a risk that these weapons will be used to abuse human rights,
fall into the hands of criminal gangs, or fuel devastating conflicts
like the Saudi/UAE-led intervention in Yemen. Absent notification,
Congress and the public would have little ability to debate, much less
block, any of these problematic exports.]{.underline} The administration
rule has tried to obscure the true danger of its approach by suggesting
that the bulk of the guns that are being removed from State Department
oversight and licensing are commercially available. For many of the
firearms being deregulated, this claim is dubious. More importantly,
many of the guns involved are military-grade, including sniper rifles.
Others, like the AR-15, have been used in tragic incidents of gun
violence such as the Parkland, Florida school shootings. Finally, in
some cases, as with sniper rifles, these weapons could end up being used
against U.S. troops involved in overseas operations. The Violence Policy
Center has compiled a lengthy list of military firearms and other
especially dangerous weapons that would be subjected to far looser
restrictions under the proposed administration plan. The firearms slated
for deregulation are the primary tools in many of the world's most
deadly conflicts, and have rightly been described as "slow motion
weapons of mass destruction." They should be subjected to more rigorous
scrutiny, not less. In addition, [the proposed rule would make it easier
for private military contractors like]{.underline} the firm formerly
known as [Blackwater to train foreign security forces without a license,
even for destinations]{.underline} like Libya and China [that raise
significant security concerns. In another particularly unwise change,
many companies that engage in firearms manufacturing would no longer
have to register with the State Department, which will make it much
harder to track their activities and prevent illegal sales or exports to
security forces or non-state groups that will use the weapons they make
to do grievous harm to civilians. This relaxation of the monitoring of
manufacturing activities will apparently extend to open source 3-D
printing, meaning that anyone could post non-proprietary instructions
for to use this process to produce untraceable hand guns and
semi-automatic firearms without have to register with State or seek an
export license from Commerce.]{.underline} This will be an invitation to
arms proliferation on a scale not yet seen. Congress should address the
3-D printing issue alongside efforts to block the Trump administration's
proposed changes in firearms export regulations. [The proposal would
also lift the obligation of U.S. arms exporting firms to report
political contributions to foreign officials and fees paid to marketing
agents in potential recipient countries. This would seriously hinder
U.S. law enforcement agencies' ability to root out corruption and
illegal transfers, which have long plagued the global trade in small
arms and light weapons.]{.underline} Last but certainly not least,
[taking]{.underline} dangerous [firearms off of the U.S.
M]{.underline}unitions [L]{.underline}ist, [as the new proposal would
do, would mean that they are no longer described as "defense articles."
As a result, they would likely fall outside the jurisdiction of a web of
carefully constructed laws that impose specific human rights criteria on
the export of such weapons.]{.underline} The concerns outlined here
underscore the risks inherent in the Trump administration's firearms
deregulation scheme. The bottom line is that implementing these rules as
written would lead to additional unnecessary deaths, bolster repressive
regimes, and make it easier for terrorists and criminal gangs to inflict
violence on innocent individuals. For all of these reasons, the new rule
should be rejected. At a minimum, Congress should move to restore the
most important elements of the current regulatory scheme, including
notification of major firearms exports and limits on the deregulation of
military-grade firearms and guns most likely to be used in mass
killings.

ship for certain watch standers and members of the ship\'s internal
security force.

#### Small arms are weapons intended for individual use and light weapons are intended for use by two or more operators

[Small arms and light weapons]{.underline} (SALW) [include all
firearms]{.underline} ([and their ammunition]{.underline}) [in the
categories of pistols, revolvers, rifles, submachine guns, and light
machine guns]{.underline} (**[all small arms]{.underline}**), [as well
as heavy machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers (portable anti-tank
weapons and MANPADS or light anti-aircraft missiles) of less than 100
millimetres calibre, hand grenades, anti-personnel mines (APM), and
cluster munitions (bombs)]{.underline} (**[all light
weapons]{.underline}**).[1](https://lawexplores.com/small-arms-and-light-weapons-inhumane-conventional-weapons-anti-personnel-mines-and-cluster-bombs/notes.xhtml#ch12en1)
[There is no universally agreed definition of small arms or light
weapons]{.underline}. [**But** it is widely recognized that both
categories of weapons include both the weapons used by the military,
security forces, and police, and the weapons that are commercially
available]{.underline} in gun shops and purchased by civilians for
personal protection or hunting. Small arms and light weapons may also be
purchased or procured illegally and sold and used by irregular forces,
terrorists, and criminal individuals or gangs. At the request of the
United Nations General Assembly, the secretary general, assisted by a
panel of governmental experts, presented a report on small arms in
1997.[[2](https://lawexplores.com/small-arms-and-light-weapons-inhumane-conventional-weapons-anti-personnel-mines-and-cluster-bombs/notes.xhtml#ch12en2)
The report describes small arms as weapons manufactured for **personal
use**]{.underline} [and carried by **one person as opposed to light
weapons**]{.underline}, [which are used and transported by **two or more
persons or in a vehicle**]{.underline}. The report concludes that there
is a clear correlation between access to weapons and drugs- and arms
smuggling and that the crimes and violence that are a result of the
availability of small arms and light weapons inhibits development
projects, economic assistance, and investment in developing countries.

#### There's no universally accepted definition of SALW- here's a laundry list of weapons it includes

**SAS ND** (Small Arms Survey \"Definitions,\" Small Arms Survey, No

<http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/weapons-and-markets/definitions.html)//Bennerz>

[There is no universally accepted definition of a \'small arm\' or of a
\'light weapon\'.]{.underline} [The Small Arms Survey largely adopts the
proposal put forward by the 1997 UN Panel of Governmental
Expert]{.underline} (available on www.un.org) [which considers
**portability a defining characteristic**]{.underline}. [The Panel's
list includes both **civilian, private, and military** weapons **that
fire a projectile** with the condition that **the unit or system may be
carried by an individual, a small number of people**, or transported by
a pack animal or a light vehicle]{.underline}. The Panel's list is
organized into \'small arms\' and \'light weapons\': **[small
arms]{.underline}**: [revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and
carbines, assault rifles, sub-machine guns and light machine guns.
**light weapons**]{.underline}: [heavy machine guns, hand-held
under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns,
portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of
anti-tank missile and rocket systems; portable launchers of
anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS); and mortars of calibres of less
than 100 mm.]{.underline} To this list, [the Survey has added
single-rail-launched rockets and 120 mm mortars as long as they can be
transported and operated as intended by a light vehicle.]{.underline}
The Survey may use the term \'small arms\' to refer to small arms and
light weapons, as well as their ammunition and parts and accessories.
The term \'light weapons\', however, always refers just to those items.
The term 'firearms' comprises small arms and heavy machine guns.

refers to the Arms Export Control Act and 22 CFR Part 120 refers to
ITAR**

In addition to sales to DOD, the U.S. TWV industrial base also sells
vehicles to foreign governments. The sale of U.S. arms and dual-use
items, including TWVs, to friendly nations and allies is an integral
component of both U.S. national security and foreign policy.1
[The]{.underline} Arms Export Control Act ([AECA]{.underline})
[authorizes the]{.underline} President to control the export and import
of arms.2 The AECA authorizes the [U.S.]{.underline} government [to sell
arms]{.underline} to foreign governments [through]{.underline}
government-to-government agreements as part of the Foreign Military
Sales ([FMS]{.underline}) program.3 [It also authorizes]{.underline} the
issuance of export licenses for U.S. manufacturers to sell arms directly
to eligible foreign governments, known as direct commercial sales
([DCS]{.underline}). Regardless of the method of sale, each FMS request
or DCS license application is reviewed by officials from DOD and the
Department of State (State) to ensure the sale would not result in harm
to U.S. interests and is consistent with national security and foreign
policies.

of different materials or a matrix. (2) Spaced armors are metallic or
non-metallic armors that incorporate an air space or obliquity or
discontinuous material path effects as part of the defeat mechanism. (3)
Reactive armor employs explosives, propellants, or other materials
between plates for the purpose of enhancing plate motion during a
ballistic event or otherwise defeating the penetrator. (4)
Electromagnetic armor (EMA) employs electricity to defeat threats such
as shaped charges. (5) Materials used in composite armor could include
layers of metals, plastics, elastomers, fibers, glass, ceramics,
ceramic-glass reinforced plastic laminates, encapsulated ceramics in a
metallic or non-metallic matrix, functionally gradient ceramic-metal
materials, or ceramic balls in a cast metal matrix. (6) For this
category, a material is considered transparent if it allows 75% or
greater transmission of light, corrected for index of refraction, in the
visible spectrum through a 1 mm thick nominal sample. (7) The material
controlled in paragraph (e)(4) of this category has not been treated to
reach the 75% transmission level referenced in (m)(6) of this category.
(8) Metal laminate armors are two or more layers of metallic materials
which are mechanically or adhesively bonded together to form an armor
system. (9) Em is the line-of-sight target mass effectiveness ratio and
provides a measure of the tested armor\'s performance to that of rolled
homogenous armor, where Em is defined as follows: [View or download
PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er02ja14.000.pdf) Where: ρRHA =
density of RHA, (7.85 g/cm3) Po = Baseline Penetration of RHA, (mm) Pr =
Residual Line of Sight Penetration, either positive or negative (mm RHA
equivalent) ADTARGET = Line-of-Sight Areal Density of Target (kg/m2) If
witness plate is penetrated, Pr is the distance from the projectile to
the front edge of the witness plate. If not penetrated, Pr is negative
and is the distance from the back edge of the target to the projectile.

complement of equipment designed from the outset to accomplish the prime
mission function of the spacecraft payload mission set. The primary
payload may operate independently from the secondary payload(s).
Secondary payload is that complement of equipment designed from the
outset to be fully integrated into the spacecraft payload mission set.
The secondary payload may operate separately from the primary payload.
Hosted payload is a complement of equipment or sensors that uses the
available or excess capacity (mass, volume, power, etc.) of a spacecraft
to accommodate an additional, independent mission. The hosted payload
may share the spacecraft bus support infrastructure. The hosted payload
performs an additional, independent mission which does not dictate
control or operation of the spacecraft. A hosted payload is not capable
of operating as an independent spacecraft. Spacecraft bus (distinct from
the spacecraft payload), provides the support infrastructure of the
spacecraft (e.g., command and data handling, communications and
antenna(s), electrical power, propulsion, thermal control, attitude and
orbit control, guidance, navigation and control, structure and truss,
life support (for crewed mission)) and location (e.g., attachment,
interface) for the spacecraft payload. Spacecraft payload is that
complement of equipment attached to the spacecraft bus that performs a
particular mission in space (e.g., communications, observation,
science). Note 2 to paragraph e)(17): An ECCN 9A004 or ECCN 9A515.a
spacecraft remains a spacecraft subject to the EAR even when
incorporating a hosted payload performing a function described in
paragraph (a) of this category. All spacecraft that incorporate primary
or secondary payloads that perform a function described in paragraph (a)
of this category are controlled by that paragraph. This paragraph does
not control primary or secondary payloads of the James Webb Space
Telescope, which are subject to the EAR. \*(18) Secondary or hosted
payload, and specially designed parts and components therefor, developed
with Department of Defense-funding; Note 1 to paragraph (e)(18): This
paragraph does not control payloads that are (a) determined to be
subject to the EAR via a commodity jurisdiction determination (see
§120.4 of this subchapter), or (b) identified in the relevant Department
of Defense contract or other funding authorization or agreement as being
developed for both military and either civil or commercial applications.
Note 2 to paragraph (e)(18): This paragraph is applicable only to those
contracts or funding authorizations or agreements that are dated May 13,
2015, or later. (19) Spacecraft heat shields or heat sinks specially
designed for atmospheric entry or re-entry, and specially designed parts
and components therefor (MT if usable in rockets, SLVs, missiles,
drones, or UAVs capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a
range of at least 300 km); Note to paragraph (e)(19): "Payload" is the
total mass that can be carried or delivered by the specified rocket,
SLV, missile, drone, or UAV that is not used to maintain flight. For
definition of "range" as it pertains to aircraft systems, see note to
paragraph (a) of USML Category VIII. For definition of "range" as it
pertains to rocket systems, see note 1 to paragraph (a) of USML Category
IV. (20) Equipment modules, stages, or compartments that incorporate

accessory, attachment, equipment, or system that: (i) Is classified;
(ii) Contains classified software; or (iii) Is being developed using
classified information. Note to paragraph (e)(21): "Classified" means
classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, or predecessor order, and
a security classification guide developed pursuant thereto or
equivalent, or to the corresponding classification rules of another
government or international organization. Note 1 to paragraph (e):
Parts, components, accessories, attachments, equipment, or systems
specially designed for spacecraft or other articles enumerated in this
category but not listed in paragraph (e) are subject to the EAR. Note 2
to paragraph (e): The articles described in this paragraph are subject
to the EAR when, prior to export, reexport, retransfer, or temporary
import, they are integrated into and included as an integral part of an
item subject to the EAR (see note 2 to paragraph (e)(17) of this
category). Articles do not become subject to the EAR until integrated
into the item subject to the EAR. Export, reexport, retransfer, or
temporary import of, and technical data and defense services directly
related to defense articles intended to be integrated remain subject to
the ITAR. Note 3 to paragraph (e): For the purposes of this paragraph,
an article is space-qualified if it is designed, manufactured, or
qualified through successful testing, for operation at altitudes greater
than 100 km above the surface of the Earth. The use of an altitude of
100 km above the surface of the Earth in this paragraph does not
represent a legal demarcation between national air space and outer space
under United States or international law. Note 4 to paragraph (e): (1) A
determination that a specific article (or commodity) (e.g., by product
serial number) is space-qualified by virtue of testing alone does not
mean that other articles in the same production run or model series are
space-qualified if not individually tested. (2) "Article" is synonymous
with "commodity," as defined in EAR §772.1. (3) A specific article not
designed or manufactured for use at altitudes greater than 100 km above
the surface of the Earth is not space-qualified before it is
successfully tested. (4) The terms "designed" and "manufactured" in this
definition are synonymous with "specially designed." (f) Technical data
(see §120.10 of this subchapter) and defense services (see §120.9 of
this subchapter) directly related to the defense articles described in
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this category and classified technical
data directly related to items controlled in ECCNs 9A515, 9B515, or
9D515 and defense services using the classified technical data. Defense
services include the furnishing of assistance (including training) to a
foreign person in the integration of a satellite or spacecraft to a
launch vehicle, including both planning and onsite support, regardless
of the jurisdiction, ownership, or origin of the satellite or
spacecraft, or whether technical data is used. It also includes the
furnishing of assistance (including training) to a foreign person in the
launch failure analysis of a satellite or spacecraft, regardless of the
jurisdiction, ownership, or origin of the satellite of spacecraft, or
whether technical data is used. (See §125.4 of this subchapter for
exemptions, and §124.15 of this subchapter for special export controls
for satellites and satellite launches.) (MT for technical data and
defense services related to articles designated as such.) Note 1 to
paragraph (f): The technical data control of this paragraph does not
apply to certain technical data directly related to articles described
in paragraphs (c) or (e) of this category when such articles are
integrated into and included as an integral part of a satellite subject
to the EAR. For controls in these circumstances, see ECCN 9E515. This
only applies to that level of technical data (including marketing data)
necessary and reasonable for a purchaser to have assurance that a U.S.
built item intended to operate in space has been designed, manufactured,
and tested in conformance with specified contract requirements (e.g.,
operational performance, reliability, lifetime, product quality, or
delivery expectations) as well as data necessary for normal orbit
satellite operations, to evaluate in-orbit anomalies, and to operate and
maintain associated ground station equipment (except encryption
hardware). Note 2 to paragraph (f): Activities and technology/technical
data directly related to or required for the spaceflight (e.g.,
sub-orbital, orbital, lunar, interplanetary, or otherwise beyond Earth
orbit) passenger or participant experience, regardless of whether the
passenger or participant experience is for space tourism, scientific or
commercial research, commercial manufacturing/production activities,
educational, media, or commercial transportation purposes, are not
subject to the ITAR or the EAR. Such activities and technology/technical
data include those directly related to or required for: (a) Spacecraft
access, ingress, and egress, including the operation of all spacecraft
doors, hatches, and airlocks; (b) physiological training (e.g.,
human-rated centrifuge training or parabolic flights, pressure suit or
spacesuit training/operation); (c) medical evaluation or assessment of
the spaceflight passenger or participant; (d) training for and operation
by the passenger or participant of health and safety related hardware
(e.g., seating, environmental control and life support, hygiene
facilities, food preparation, exercise equipment, fire suppression,
communications equipment, safety-related clothing or headgear) or
emergency procedures; (e) viewing of the interior and exterior of the
spacecraft or terrestrial mock-ups; (f) observing spacecraft operations
(e.g., pre-flight checks, landing, in-flight status); (g) training in
spacecraft or terrestrial mock-ups for connecting to or operating
passenger or participant equipment used for purposes other than
operating the spacecraft; or (h) donning, wearing, or utilizing the
passenger\'s or participant\'s flight suit, pressure suit, or spacesuit,
and personal equipment. Note 3 to paragraph (f): Paragraph (f) and ECCNs
9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data transmitted to or from a
satellite or spacecraft, whether real or simulated, when limited to
information about the health, operational status, or measurements or
function of, or raw sensor output from, the spacecraft, spacecraft
payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such information
is not within the scope of information captured within the definition of
technology in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E.
Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as
"housekeeping data," include (i) system, hardware, component
configuration, and operation status information pertaining to
temperatures, pressures, power, currents, voltages, and battery charges;
(ii) spacecraft or payload orientation or position information, such as
state vector or ephemeris information; (iii) payload raw mission or
science output, such as images, spectra, particle measurements, or field
measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing information;
and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry
data---i.e., converting raw data into engineering units or readable
products---or encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the
telemetry data to become subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for
purposes of 9A515, or to ECCNs 9E001 or 9E002 for purposes of 9A004. All
classified technical data directly related to items controlled in USML
Category XV or ECCNs 9A515, and defense services using the classified
technical data, remains subject to the ITAR. This note does not affect
controls in USML XV(f), ECCN 9D515, or ECCN 9E515 on software source
code or commands that control a spacecraft, payload, or associated
subsystems for purposes of 9A515. This note also does not affect
controls in ECCNs 9D001, 9D002, 9E001, or 9E002 on software source code

relevant across the entire range of development thinking and action,
gender issues are often neglected. [There is a need for strong political
will to ensure that they receive adequate attention and the requisite
technical competence so that they are effectively
addressed]{.underline}. • Gender issues are often misunderstood. In many
development initiatives, programmers and analysts often lose sight of
the primary objective of a concern for gender, that is, to move towards
more equitable relations between women and men. All too often gender
issues are conceived as solely concerning the number of women
participants or the development of marginal side initiatives for women
within mainstream programmes. • **[Without an explicit recognition and
understanding of gender inequalities and differences, development
initiatives can worsen women's situation and gender
relations.]{.underline}** [Experience has shown that the assumption
"both women and men will benefit equally" is false.]{.underline} [The
division of labour and responsibilities]{.underline} (who does what
work), [social attitudes, and unequal access to resources all contribute
to a situation where policies and programmes have a different impact on
women and men]{.underline}, (for example, education initiatives and
poverty reduction strategies). Furthermore, these differences and
inequalities influence how women and men participate in and respond to
new initia - tives. • Gender issues are relevant in understanding
post-conflict dynamics. Recent advocacy and scholarship have drawn
attention to how and why gender differences and inequalities are
relevant during and after armed conflicts. There is growing interest in
understanding how gender issues interweave with disarmament initiatives.

### Conditions Fail- Generic

#### Conditions are essentially the squo and have empirically failed

American Affairs. Kristin Finklea, Specialist in Domestic Security.
\"U.S.-Mexican Security Cooperation: The Mérida Initiative and Beyond,\"
Congressional Research Service, June 29, 2017,
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41349.pdf)//Bennerz>

[Congress has expressed ongoing concerns about human rights conditions
in Mexico. These concerns have intensified as U.S. security assistance
to Mexico has increased]{.underline} under the Mérida Initiative.
**[Congress has continued monitoring adherence to the "Leahy laws" that
require vetting for Mexican security forces to receive U.S. DOD or State
Department support.]{.underline}**108 [From FY2008 to FY2015, **Congress
also conditioned U.S. assistance to the Mexican military and police on
compliance with certain human rights standards**]{.underline}. [In an
October 19, 2015, briefing, a spokesperson said that although the State
Department was "unable to confirm and report to Congress that Mexico
fully met all of the \[human rights\] criteria in the Fiscal Year 2014
appropriation legislation]{.underline} (P.L. 113-76) \... \[[it
continues\] to strongly support Mexico's ongoing efforts]{.underline} to
reform its law enforcement and justice systems." As a result of the
State Department's decision not to submit a report for Mexico, some \$5
million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE)
assistance was reprogrammed to Peru. Mexico lost close to \$500,000 in
foreign military financing (FMF) that was withheld as well. For FY2015,
human rights groups again urged the State Department not to submit a
human rights progress report for Mexico as required by P.L. 113-235. 109
[In September 2016, the State Department did submit a report certifying
that Mexico was taking steps to improve respect for human rights through
the transition to an accusatorial justice system, among other
measures.]{.underline}110 **[The report stated, however, that
"emblematic human rights cases \... underscore the continuing challenges
and the need for further action to protect human rights and the rule of
law."]{.underline}** The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L.
114-113) contained conditions similar to those described above in P.L.
113-235, but they applied to FMF rather than to Mérida Initiative
aid.111 [The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act]{.underline} (P.L.
115-31) [has]{.underline} slightly different [conditions]{.underline},
but they also apply to FMF as opposed to Mérida Initiative aid
accounts.112 [The State Department has established a high-level human
rights dialogue with Mexico, provided human rights training for Mexican
security forces, and implemented a number of human rightsrelated
programs]{.underline}. USAID has supported a \$5 million program being
implemented by Freedom House to improve protections for Mexican
journalists and human rights defenders that is in the process of being
extended and augmented. USAID is dedicating \$25 million through 2018
for that and other human rights programs focused on helping Mexico
develop a national human rights strategy, assist victims of torture and
other abuses, and develop and implement legislation related to
preventing and punishing human rights abuses. Congress may choose to
augment Mérida Initiative funding for human rights programs, such as
ongoing training programs for military and police, or newer efforts,
such as support for human rights organizations. Human rights conditions
in Mexico, as well as compliance with conditions on Mérida assistance,
are also likely to continue to be important oversight issues. Along with
consideration of providing funds to help secure Mexico's southern
border, Congress may consider how to help mitigate concerns about
migrants' rights in Mexico.

### Conditions Fail- Gender

#### Conditional human rights constraints fail to solve gender-violence

**Alley 19**

**(Roderic Alley, Centre for Strategic Studies, Victoria University of
Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand (2019) Small arms and light weapons:
the disjunction problem, Conflict, Security & Development, 19:2,
143-172, DOI: 10.1080/14678802.2019.1570722, JKS)**

**[This is lacking for SALW restraints anchored in human rights where
conditional, not definitive, determinations prevail]{.underline}**.
[This is seen in the United States Presidential Directive of 2018
regarding conventional arms transfers. Here, no more than 'account is
taken' regarding conditions where such transfers may contribute to
abuses of human rights, including acts of gender-based
violence]{.underline} or acts of violence against children, violations
of IHL, terrorism, mass atrocities or transnational organised crime.99
Different problems confront the otherwise soundly constructed Nairobi
Protocol on Small Arms and Light Weapons in force since 2005.100 They
relate to problems confronting African Union--UN Security Council
agreement in managing ongoing dispute settlement and conflict
resolution.101 States party to the Nairobi Protocol variously in
violation of its prescriptions, include Burundi, the DRC, Djibouti,
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. [Overall, the
disjunctive gap dividing current state conduct from rights-based,
ethical considerations in the transfer and receipt of SALW is
substantial. Prospects for eroding its reinforcements depend on the
extent to which mitigation of civilian harm is not just acknowledged,
but moved from the margins to centres of relevant policy
determination.]{.underline} [An ethical failure to do so can risk
negative consequences, and appreciation that what is morally right is
more often than not politically right is slowly growing.]{.underline}
Foreign policy advantages can accrue to states choosing not to export
SALW into locations exhibiting egregious rights violations.

### No Compliance

#### No way to know if Mexico complies

**Lindsay-Poland 18** (John Lindsay-Poland, researcher specializing in
Latin American foreign policy with over 30 years of experience \"How
U.S. Guns Sold to Mexico End Up With Security Forces Accused of Crime
and Human Rights Abuses,\" Intercept, 4-26-2018,
https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/mexico-arms-trade-us-gun-sales/)//Bennerz

These are unusual cases, in that we know which weapons were involved.
**[Most homicides in Mexico --- including those carried out by state
forces --- are never investigated, so there is no judicial record
identifying the firearms that were used]{.underline}**. But [the volume
of U.S. firearms going to Mexico, combined with the well-established
record of police and military forces colluding with organized crime and
committing gross human rights violations, means that U.S. guns are
certainly at the scene of many more crimes.]{.underline}

### Can't Solve FMS

#### Those human rights conditions don't apply to police receiving FMS

**AFSC 16**

**(The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is a Quaker
organization that promotes lasting peace with justice, as a practical
expression of faith in action. The AFSC delegation traveled in Mexico
from June 12 to 26, 2016. It was made up of 17 participants, primarily
from the United States, as well as from Mexico, Guatemala, and Israel.
The group included AFSC staff with long experience in issues of arms
transfers and immigration policy, as well as journalists, a
videographer, and other activists. We were supported in country by Casa
de los Amigos (Mexico City, casadelosamigos.org), Fray Matías Human
Rights Center (Chiapas, cdhfraymatias.org), and the Tlachinollan Human
Rights Center (Guerrero, tlachinollan.org). This report was written by

JKS)**

In addition to U.S. grant assistance to Mexico, most of which is
channeled to U.S. companies, [the United States has also approved the
transfer through sales of billions of dollars' worth of other arms to
the Mexican government.]{.underline} According to The Washington Post,
[the value of weapons and military equipment sold was \$3.5 billion from
2012 to 2015 and included firearms, armored vehicles, helicopters, and
other military aircraft.1]{.underline}6 "We didn't sell them just the
helicopters," a former Pentagon official on Mexico policy told The New
York Times. "We sold them 15 years of working intimately together that
we would not otherwise have."17 Whatever the pretext or mode of
delivery, **[the evidence is strong that such U.S. military transfers
contribute significantly to violence, instability, and the denial of
human rights.]{.underline}** [Because of the depth of corruption in the
Mexican government, police and armed forces blur the lines between
official groups and criminals, and **legal arms sales** frequently end
up arming criminal gangs and criminal conduct directly.]{.underline}
Moreover, [the Mexican police and military have a long history of
repression against mostly peaceful social movements.]{.underline} In
2013 alone, the United States exported to Mexico 5,810 revolvers and
pistols, 7,223 rifles, 30 assault rifles, 1,311 machine guns, 7,145
shotguns, 34 grenade launchers, and 20 anti-tank missile launchers,
according to data reported to the United Nations. [Among these weapons
were U.S.-produced and exported rifles used by the police who attacked
and handed over 43 student teachers from Ayotzinapa to a local criminal
gang in September 2014]{.underline}. Documents from the Mexican defense
ministry's arms registry include the weapons possessed by municipal
police in Iguala, who carried out the crime. Among the arms listed: 20
assault rifles produced by Colt's Manufacturing, headquartered in
Hartford, Connecticut. Colt sold the Mexican government those rifles,
which arrived in Guerrero in 2013.18 U.S. [Embassy staff assured us that
police who are shown to have committed grave human rights abuses are
barred from receiving U.S. training**. But the restriction apparently
does not apply to police receiving U.S.-exported weapons.**]{.underline}
[An increasing amount of arms sales to Mexico are made directly by the
United States government, through its **Foreign Military Sales**
program]{.underline}, rather than in commercial transactions with the
producers, known as Direct Commercial Sales, even though those producers
still profit from the sales.

### AT: Leahy Law (HR Conditions)

#### The Leahy Law sucks

**Amnesty International 19** (Amnesty International USA \"Deconstructing
the Leahy Law: Fact vs Fiction,\" 2-8-2019,
https://www.amnestyusa.org/deconstructing-the-leahy-law-fact-vs-fiction/)//Bennerz

Fiction: The Leahy Law solves the human rights problems of foreign
military and police units. Interestingly, [**the Leahy Law places the
burden on both the U.S. government and human rights organizations** to
document and compile information regarding alleged abuses]{.underline}
-- but the law and associated vetting process is not perfect, [nor will
it alone solve the human rights problems of foreign security
units.]{.underline} Take for example, the vetting process itself. **[The
U.S. government currently utilizes Google key word searches as a first
step in its online investigation]{.underline}** (and for those who
aren't familiar with this type of search, [it does not pick up
information in PDFs]{.underline} -- so a tip for fellow human rights
organizations: make sure your reports are also available in HTML/text).
Additional staff dedicated solely to the vetting process have, however,
recently been added to the State Department's payroll -- indicating that
this process may be strengthening. [The Leahy Law is by no means a
silver bullet]{.underline}- take for example the gap in oversight of
arms sales which the recently adopted (and. we hope, soon to be signed
and ratified by the U.S.) Arms Trade Treaty promises to fill. The Arms
Trade Treaty (ATT) requires that arms exporters conduct an assessment of
the risk that the arms could be used in committing human rights
violations, and to take measures to mitigate that risk or halt the
transfer if the risk reaches a certain level.

#### Leahy Law is just for FMF

**DOD 19** (United States Department Of State \"Leahy Law Fact Sheet,\"
Bureau Of Democracy, Human Rights, And Labor, 1-22-2019,
https://www.state.gov/key-topics-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/human-rights/leahy-law-fact-sheet/)//Bennerz

What are Leahy laws? [The term "Leahy law" refers to two statutory
provisions prohibiting the U.S. Government from **using funds for
assistance** to units of foreign security forces where there is credible
information implicating that unit in the commission of a gross violation
of human rights]{.underline} (GVHR). One statutory provision applies to
the State Department and the other applies to the Department of Defense.
The State Department Leahy law was made permanent under section 620M of
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. 2378d. The U.S. government
includes torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance, and
rape under color of law as GVHRs when implementing the Leahy law.
Incidents are examined on a fact-specific basis. The State Department
Leahy law includes an exception permitting assistance to a unit if the
Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the
government of the implicated foreign security forces unit is taking
effective steps to bring the responsible members to justice.

## \*\*AT: ATT CP\*\*

### ATT Fails- Gender

#### The ATT has vague criteria which allows for states to make their own decisions -- only the plan solves gender-based violence

**Rosengren No Date --** (Emma Rosengren, PhD Student at the Department
of Economic History, Stockholm University, Sweden, "Addressing the
impacts of the arms trade on gender-based violence," Women\'s
International League for Peace and Freedom,
<https://www.peacewomen.org/assets/file/ATT/summary.pdf>) // S.Y.

[In this]{.underline} side [event]{.underline} attended by more than 100
participants, [arranged by]{.underline} the Women's International League
for Peace and Freedom ([WILPF]{.underline}), the Women's Network of the
International Action Network on Small Arms ([IANSA]{.underline}), [and
Amnesty International]{.underline} in cooperation with the Permanent
Mission of Finland to the United Nations, [speakers addressed the
important issue of how the arms trade treaty (ATT) could include, and
thereby contribute to preventing, gender-based violence]{.underline}.
The seminar was chaired by Rita Resch, Head of the ATT delegation of
Finland. Madeleine Rees, Secretary General of WILPF, stressed that the
[ATT will be written within a legal framework of international law in
which gender mainstreaming in the UN is already an obligation, thus **an
ATT that does not take gender-based violence into account is not an
option**]{.underline}. According to Ms. Rees, [the ATT must have
preventive elements in order to be effective, and it has to be
reflective of the obligation to protect. These elements include both
negative obligation not to sell arms if there is a risk that it could be
used to facilitate gender-based violence, but also positive obligations
to prevent, protect, and punish, as well as to provide compensation to
victims]{.underline}. In terms of what should be included in a risk
assessment, Ms. Rees argue that [**if states are left to interpret** and
decide on **criteria** themselves, or if the criteria are not specific
enough, **states will set their own standards, which will** likely
**lead to violations of human rights** through irresponsible arms
transfers.]{.underline} By sharing her first-hand experience on how
armed violence is a huge threat to women's security, Marren
Akatsa-Bukachi, Executive Director of the Eastern African Sub-regional
Support Initiative for the Advancement of Women (EASSI), put emphasis on
why [an ATT cannot be allowed to leave gender-related violence out of
its criteria. Firearms help making rape possible, she noted, and too
many women suffer from this reality every day]{.underline}. This clearly
has negative consequences for women's physical and psychological health,
but also for the society as a whole. [The different impact of small arms
and light weapons (SALW) on men, women, boys, and girls is clear proof
of why **both SALW and gender based violence**, including sexualized
violence and rape, **have to be included in the ATT**]{.underline}. Ms.
Akatsa-Bukachi called for the creation of a critical mass in the
negotiation room in favour of including this topic in the ATT criteria.
Dr. Dan Kuwali of the Republic of Malawi argued that wars today have no
frontiers, and that conflict-related rape is a clear example of that. He
emphasized that while gender-based violence does not exclusively apply
to women, it is necessary to highlight that men most often are the
perpetrators and that women are most often the victims. He also argued
that rape as a manifestation of dominance is so widespread due to the
fact that SALW and ammunition is too easily accessible, cheap, and easy
to use. In this regard, he also said that firearms are used as a license
to oppress, both in the private and in the public. The legal framework
on Women, Peace and Security manifested in UN Security Council
resolutions 1325 and 1820 and the Beijing Platform for Action are only a
few examples of how the UN has already focused on gender-based violence,
hence [it has to be included as a specific criteria and in the goals and
objectives of the ATT]{.underline}. Clare da Silva of Amnesty
International presented the main priorities of her organization, arguing
that the criteria of the ATT must be comprehensive while also including
details regarding risk assessment. She stressed that it is important
that all relevant information about end-users, usage, and misuse are
taken into account, and that [states should be required to investigate
if an arms transfer is likely to be used to facilitate gender -based
violence.]{.underline} Likewise, the scope of the treaty has to do the
same, and all conventional arms that do and can facilitate the
identified violations have to be included. In order to ensure
efficiency, effective control mechanisms with high inter-national
standards are necessary, as well as an obligation to implement these
standards including risk assessment. According to Ms. da Silva, [by
including gender-based violence in the criteria of the ATT, both
exporters and importers are obliged to ensure that violations will not
take place. Several participants raised different concerns]{.underline}
in the Q&A session, [including the importance of reaching out to states
that have not already asked for gender-based violence to be included in
the operational part of the treaty.]{.underline} Clearly, the critical
mass needed for the ATT to contribute to prevent gender-based violence
has started to take form, but will have to grow during the coming days.
The diverse experiences of the panelists in this seminar clearly shows
that in order to increase women's security, the ATT should require
states to not allow an international transfer of conventional arms where
there is a substantial risk that the arms under consideration are likely
to be used to perpetrate or facilitate acts of gender-based violence,
including rape and other forms of sexual violence.

#### The Arms Trade Treaty doesn't solve GBV -- states always find a way to sidestep

// S.Y.

Drafting the ATT: keeping GBV on the agenda

During the 2012 and 2013 Diplomatic Conferences, [campaigners and states
which championed the GBV issue applied sustained pressure to ensure
language assessing the risk of GBV made it into the draft
Treaty]{.underline} (and did not drop out at final draft stage).
[Champions of strong obligations relating to GBV in the ATT **included
Iceland, Trinidad and Tobago, Norway, Finland, Kenya, and
Malawi**.]{.underline} These countries worked hard to find common ground
and craft treaty language that had the greatest buy-in and resonance
with negotiating states. [Some went as far as to make GBV one of their
'red-line' negotiating positions]{.underline}.5

Their clear leadership, and strong articulation of unambiguous treaty
language, persuaded the silent majority of states to lend their support
to the issue and the language suggestions for treaty text.

[GBV first appeared in the National Assessment section of the final
draft Treaty text of the July 2012 Diplomatic Conference]{.underline}.
At this point, [the principle of putting international humanitarian and
human rights law at the heart of the Treaty\'s risk
assessment]{.underline} [provisions was close to being won, and GBV
fitted well within that narrative. However, some states rejected the
inclusion of language on GBV and VAW for a variety of reasons. **Some
argued** that the **concept of GBV was insufficiently defined** to
appear in a legally binding text, and that specific **provisions were
unnecessary** since it was already included through the references to
human rights and humanitarian law.]{.underline}

Bearing in mind these tensions, the fact that GBV appeared at all in
these early drafts was a signal of the strength of the champion
state--civil society alliance. **[However, language of the provision was
so weak as to render it almost meaningles]{.underline}**s; a clear
reflection of the political concessions that were being explored to
achieve consensus[. GBV had effectively been relegated, alongside other
potentially controversial issues, to a section which only obliged states
to 'consider taking feasible measures']{.underline} (Draft of the Arms
Trade Treaty 2012, Article 4) [to avoid GBV]{.underline}. This was in
stark contrast to much stronger language dealing with violations of
human rights and humanitarian law.

[Campaigners and states championing the issue were particularly
concerned that this would result in States Parties treating GBV as a
'lesser' category of abuse, which would be inconsistent with the
treaty\'s stronger provisions on violations of human rights and
humanitarian law]{.underline}. In order to avoid this, [there were
suggestions]{.underline} during the second conference in March 2013
[that GBV should simply be referenced in the Preamble]{.underline}
(separate from the risk-assessment obligations of the treaty). [This
would not have created the new, global, operational norm on assessing
risks of GBV in arms transfers which proponents were aiming
for.]{.underline} The eventual strong language on GBV in the operational
part of the treaty was due in large part to campaigners and champion
governments collaborating to win over other states

### ATT Fails- Small Arms

#### Specifically, the CP can't solve for small arms

**Lito and Davies 13 --** (Melina Lito and Sara E. Davies, Program
Director at the Women Peace & Security Program and Senior Research
Fellow at Griffith University, "UN Arms Treaty Waters Down Role of
Weapons in Sexual- and Gender-Based Violence," IPI Global Observatory,
March 19, 2013,
<https://theglobalobservatory.org/2013/03/un-arms-treaty-waters-down-role-of-weapons-in-sexual-and-gender-based-violence/>)
// S.Y.

[The connection between small arms/light weapons and aggravated violence
against women and girls was powerfully acknowledged in last week's
agreed conclusions of the UN Commission of the Status of
Women]{.underline} (CSW); this week, **[however, that connection is
about to be weakened in the proposed Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT)]{.underline}**, which begins negotiations on the text this week.
[The]{.underline} draft [text of the ATT has provided a loophole for
some member states to consider acts of sexual and gender-violence as not
legitimate grounds for prohibiting a weapons transfer]{.underline}.
Given Australia's role as chair of upcoming ATT conference, there are
ways the Australian government could help reverse this.

Key Conclusions

[Article 4]{.underline} in the draft text of the proposed Arms Trade
Treaty ha[s significantly watered down language around sexual- and
gender-based violence as a condition for preventing arms
trades.]{.underline}

[Though only 75 member states have declared support for the inclusion of
gender in the ATT, there is strong political and legal precedent for its
inclusion.]{.underline}

As chair of the ATT, the Australian government is well-positioned to
advocate in favor of SGBV's inclusion in Article 4.

Analysis

From March 18-28, 2013, member states will convene at the UN Conference
of an Arms Trade Treaty in an attempt to pass what they failed to do in
July 2012: establish common international standards for the import,
export and transfer of conventional arms.

Analysts following the ATT process have noted a number of the problems
with the draft text. One of these concerns relates to Article 4, where
states are to establish a "national risk assessment criteria'" that will
reduce arms sales and transfers if they could pose a threat to
international peace and security. Presently [within Article 4, the only
time gender-based violence appears is in Article 4 (6) which calls for
exporting states to take "feasible measures" to ensure that weapons
transfers and sales are not used for, among other things, gender-based
violence. These measures are not mandatory and in contrast to earlier
Article 4(2) and 4(5), both of which refer to any violation of
international humanitarian law and international human rights law as
grounds for the transfer to not occur.]{.underline}

As Reaching Critical Will has outlined, [this is unacceptable for two
reasons. First, gender-based violence]{.underline} ---particularly acts
of widespread and systematic sexual and gender-based violence
(SGBV)---[can violate international law under the 1998 Rome Statute. As
such, demarcating gender-based violence from 4(2) to be listed in 4(6)
either gives way to a view held by some states that acts of sexual and
gender-violence do not always violate international law or that these
acts are not legitimate grounds for prohibiting a weapons
transfer.]{.underline}

[There is strong political and legal precedent for]{.underline} this to
be reversed and for the term [SGBV to be included in any national risk
assessment criteria]{.underline} that would lead to denial of a weapons
transfer on the grounds that these acts are both a violation of
international law and a threat on international peace and security. For
example, [in 2000, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution
1325 that stated]{.underline} in its preamble, "[Recognizing that an
understanding of the impact of armed conflict on women and girls,
effective institutional arrangements to guarantee their protection and
full participation in the peace process can significantly contribute to
the maintenance and promotion of international peace and
security]{.underline}."

As we discuss below, numerous Security Council resolutions have since
passed linking international peace and security with the prevention of
SGBV and the prevention of illicit trade in conventional arms (as
presently stated in the draft ATT preamble).

In February 2013, Australia issued a statement to the Security Council
outlining its support for the Presidential Statement on the Protection
of Civilians. In this statement, Ambassador Gary Quinlan, Australia's
Permanent Ambassador to the UN, referred to the need for the ATT to pass
into international law. Indeed, the Australian statement described the
ATT as being essential for upholding the Protection of Civilians and
maintenance of international peace and security: "Some 2,000
people--mostly civilians, many women and children--are killed every day
from the illicit and irresponsible trade in weapons. We can fix this."

Given Australia's role as chair of upcoming ATT conference, there are
three areas where the Australian government could advocate in favor of
SGBV inclusion in Article 4(2).

First, it is surprising that so few states (75) have declared support
for the inclusion of gender in the ATT; the numbers are very small in
the Asia-Pacific, with only Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.
Australia's co-members from the Group of Friends on Protection of
Civilians include crucial members from regional blocs (i.e., Brazil and
Japan) but are yet to commit. There is a risk that Australia and other
states may walk away from the gender references to secure the treaty's
passage. This would have damaging consequences for the ATT itself and
the broader Women Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. The alternative
option to walking away would be that Australia proactively appeals for
support from other Groups of Friends bodies (including the
Responsibility to Protect) to strengthen these references in the ATT.

Second, as noted above, [the UN Security Council has repeatedly affirmed
a relationship between SGBV and armed conflict, **including small-arms
supply**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the Security Council approved in
Resolution 1960]{.underline}, compiling information concerning countries
and armed groups at risk of SGBV in situations of conflict and civil
unrest, [which led to report S/2010/498 and S/2011/598. Both reports
**specifically links control of small arms and weapons trade to curbing
gender violence**]{.underline} (S/2010/498, Annex 1 Goal 17; S/2011/598,
Annex 1, Output 3.2.1). In S/2012/33, numerous situations such as
Somalia and Sudan, were identified by the Secretary-General as being
situations of extreme SGBV risk because of the uncontrolled flow of
arms. These reports document situations of armed conflict and civil
unrest where risk of SGBV is high.

[Such reports on situations of risk]{.underline}, like
S/2012/33---presented to both the General Assembly and the Security
Council---[would complement the national risk assessments and could be
useful inclusions for strengthening oversight of the implementation of
the ATT.]{.underline} Again, given that Australia has been an advocate
of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, this is the opportunity
to [use evidence of prior UNSC consensus on relationship between SGBV
and small arms to push for ATT and WPS language to advocate for
support]{.underline}, rather than walk away from in[clusion of SGBV into
the mandatory criteria for national risk assessment under draft ATT
Article 4.]{.underline}

Third, there is concern at present that within the Security Council
itself there is a degree of pushback on the pursuit of the WPS agenda.
Some permanent and non-permanent UNSC members have questioned whether
acts of widespread SGBV in situations of civil unrest, for example, are
a matter for the Council's deliberations. As such, the relegation of
gender-based violence to the less prescriptive and mandatory Article
4(6) would set a dangerous precedent and must be challenged.

Australia should support the United Kingdom and seek alliances with
regional allies--from within the Security Council and without--to ensure
that the ATT does not allow states to undertake the sale or transfer of
arms to parties who have or are likely to commit SGBV crimes.

### ATT Fails- Generic

#### ATT fails to stop arms exports- weak implementation and transparency

**Knight 17** (Ben Knight, journalist. \"UN\'s Arms Trade Treaty \'too
weak to make a difference\',\" DW, 11-9-2017,

Diplomats from over 100 countries met in Geneva, Switzerland on Monday
to discuss why the United Nations\' landmark Arms Trade Treaty
([ATT]{.underline}),which came into force three years ago[, has so far
failed to stop the flow of weapons to the world\'s war
zones.]{.underline} Celebrated as a paradigm shift in the regulation of
the international arms trade, **[the ATT now looks like a
disappointment, according to statements issued by NGOs instrumental in
campaigning for it and then drawing it up.]{.underline}** \"About [half
a million people are killed every year by firearms, and millions more
are trapped in brutal conflicts fueled by reckless arms
sales]{.underline},\" James Lynch, Head of Arms Control and Human Rights
at Amnesty International, said in a statement. \"[The Arms Trade Treaty
promised to save countless lives by reigning in this massive, secretive
industry, but at the moment **weak implementation and a lack of
transparency** are threatening to undermine it.\"]{.underline} The ATT
is supposed to commit nations to stopping the export of conventional
weapons if, as Amnesty puts it, \"there is an overriding risk they could
contribute to serious violations of international human rights or
humanitarian law.\" USA unterzeichnet Waffenhandelsabkommen
(picture-alliance/dpa) US Secretary of State John Kerry signed the ATT
in 2013 A rule no one follows Attending the third Conference of States
Parties to the ATT was Amnesty\'s Rasha Abdul Rahim, who explained that
[diplomats]{.underline} there still [considered the treaty \"in its
infancy.\"]{.underline} \"I tend to agree that it\'s too early to tell
what the full impact of the treaty is,\" she told DW. \"However, [we are
really concerned with **the business-as-usual approach** that we\'re
seeing with some state parties. We\'re frustrated that we\'re not seeing
as **robust and transparent** regulation of the arms trade as we would
like.\"]{.underline} Andrew Smith, [spokesman for the Campaign Against
Arms Trade (CAAT)]{.underline}, [said there had always been problems
with the ATT.]{.underline} \"**[We aren\'t aware of any arms exports
that have actually been stopped by the ATT]{.underline}**,\" he said.
\"[It\'s evident that the treaty is **too weak** to make any meaningful
difference.\"]{.underline} But, as Amnesty\'s Rahim pointed out, \"it\'s
really difficult to tell\" whether the ATT has had any effect, because
\"when states don\'t authorize an arms transfer, they don\'t usually
give a reason for doing so.\" [Several countries]{.underline} including
Germany, which ratified the ATT in 2014, [have guidelines that the
government is supposed to follow when it approves weapons exports, but
they remain just that -- guidelines, not laws]{.underline}. [CAAT were
skeptical because the major arms exporting countries had been getting
behind the ATT while maintaining, like Germany, that they already had
robust arms export controls. The treaty was also being championed by
arms companies - **not exactly a sign that it was particularly
tough.**]{.underline} \"But [there are also major shortcomings in the
treaty itself]{.underline},\" Smith of the CAAT said. \"[It\'s not
entirely clear]{.underline} from reading it [who would enforce the rules
or how they would be enforced, or what would happen to anyone who broke
them.\"]{.underline} Mark Bromley, co-director of the arms control
program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI),
was more patient. \"People are looking it at through the rubric of
previous instruments such as the land mine treaty, which banned a whole
class of weapons, and that was never something the ATT was ever going to
do. [It was always about a much softer process of trying to create
standards about the way states regulate the arms trade.\"]{.underline}
It\'s in such an area---persuading countries to be more transparent, for
instance---that the ATT summit could make progress this week. Airstrikes
in Sanaa (picture-alliance/dpa/M. Mohammed) Yemen has been the subject
of a relentless Saudi bombing campaign The destruction of Yemen The ATT
has so far been signed by 130 countries, and ratified by 89, including
some of the world\'s biggest arms exporters: the UK, France, and
Germany. Other major arms exporters, including the US and Israel, have
signed the agreement, but not yet ratified it, while Russia and China
have done neither. **[Amnesty listed several examples of countries
signing the treaty and then ignoring it.]{.underline}** [For instance,
France, the UK, and Italy, who all ratified the ATT in April 2014, have
carried on sending all kinds of conventional weapons to Egypt while the
government there continues to brutally crack down on dissent by killing
and torturing thousands of protesters.]{.underline} Perhaps the most
egregious single example of an ATT signatory ignoring the treaty is the
UK\'s recent \$4.7-billion (3.9-billion-euro) arms deal with Saudi
Arabia, a country that has been leading a relentless bombing campaign in
the Yemen Civil War since 2015. According to Sally Copley, Oxfam
Britain\'s head of campaigns, Yemen is currently suffering \"the
world\'s worst humanitarian crisis,\" involving both a \"borderline
famine\" and a massive cholera epidemic. \"When you are witness to the
suffering in Yemen it is hard to understand or excuse how the UK
government talks the talk on arms control while it walks the walk of
arms sales,\" Copley said in a statement. \"On the one hand it fuels a
war with massive arms sales while it sends aid to help the people it is
harming.\" SIPRI figures show exports to Saudi Arabia made up 48 percent
of the UK\'s arms exports from 2012 to 2016, while in May this year the
US agreed a \$110 billion worth of potential arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
Those deals included \$4.6 billion worth of guided air-to-ground
munitions---a total of 104,000 bombs of the type that have been used in
the Yemen war. Other deliveries in 2015-16 included 13,726 anti-tank
missiles; 3,870 guided bombs; 60 combat helicopters and 1,279 armored
vehicles and four fighter ground attack aircraft.

### No Enforcement

#### ATT has no enforcement mechanism 

**Countryman and Stohl 5/10** (Thomas M. Countryman and Rachel Stohl

foot,\" Defense News, 5-10-2019,

The president repeated the false claims that the ATT could lead to
United Nations bureaucrats taking guns away from American citizens. But
the treaty explicitly says that administration of the ATT is purely the
responsibility of national governments, consistent with their own
constitutional and legal systems. [The ATT does not create any
supranational bureaucracy that requires the United States to give up its
sovereignty to foreign countries in making any arms transfer
decisions]{.underline}. And most importantly, **[the ATT only regulates
the international trade in weapons and has no effect]{.underline}** ---
in the United States or elsewhere --- **[on legitimate domestic trade or
individual rights to bear arms.]{.underline}**

#### ATT is literally the worst

What is remarkable is the second assumption: that [a completely
aspirational treaty, one that empowers governments to do **what they
already have the power to do anyhow**]{.underline}, [one that contains
absolutely **no definitions** and]{.underline} (thank goodness) **[no
enforcement mechanism]{.underline}**, **[one that offers no
incentives]{.underline}** whatsoever **[for compliance]{.underline}**,
**[one that completely ignores the fundamental problems of government
incompetence and malevolence]{.underline}**, [one which was and is
completely uninterested in any unintended consequences]{.underline},
[one which has no standard for success]{.underline}, [one which is so
uninteresting to its supporters that they neither pay their bills nor
submit their reports]{.underline}, [and one which assumes that the way
to improve the performance of governments is to get them to sign pieces
of paper is an example of helpful and effective multilateral
diplomacy.]{.underline} **[It is not]{.underline}**. It is both the
negation of diplomacy and a sustained assault on the idea of the treaty
as it has been traditionally understood. And that is why I have always
opposed [the Arms Trade Treaty]{.underline}: it [is bad
diplomacy]{.underline}. In the U.S. we take treaties seriously and we
are right to do so. **[The Arms Trade Treaty is not a serious
document]{.underline}**. It is a promise to be good --- later. **[It
imposes rules that, in the nature of things, will only impinge on the
rule-abiding democracies, which are precisely the places that need more
rules the least]{.underline}**. The reaction to the president's
dismissal of the treaty shows how little understanding of (never mind
appreciation for) this position there is. But make no mistake: this
position is neither radical nor new. It is the traditional American one.
The fact that it has all but disappeared from among the elite, who
prefer a treaty backed by supporters who praise PressTV while contemning
the U.S., shows that the treaty is not the core problem. [The core
problem is that the elite no longer understand why treaties like the
Arms Trade Treaty are a bad idea.]{.underline}

The ATT Today In practice, **[the ATT has achieved
nothing]{.underline}**. [That is no surprise]{.underline}. [If a nation
wants a control system for its arms exports, it can impose
one]{.underline}: No treaty is necessary. [If a nation lacks the desire
or the ability to impose such a system, **a treaty will not improve its
governance**]{.underline}. [The ATT contains no verification provisions
and creates no incentives for compliance]{.underline}. In short, it is a
perfect example of an aspirational treaty, one defined by pious wishes,
not serious commitments.12 **[The low level of national compliance with
the ATT's most minimal requirements demonstrates the treaty's
substantive failure]{.underline}**. [Over the ATT's first two budgets,
only 78 of the 140 assessed nations]{.underline} (55 percent) [paid into
the treaty]{.underline}.13 [Only 49 nations out of 75]{.underline} (65
percent) [submitted the required national report on arms imports and
exports]{.underline} for 2016.14 Activists now bemoan the ATT's failure,
which they define solely as its inability to stop Western arms sales to
Saudi Arabia.15 The Obama Administration abandoned the previous
administration's opposition to the ATT on the explicit understanding
that the treaty would only be adopted by consensus. But when push came
to shove, the Obama Administration broke its own red line and supported
the ATT's adoption by majority vote of the U.N. General Assembly. This
set a dangerous precedent for future treaty negotiations: Nations are
now likely to assume that the U.S. will abandon its insistency on
consensus if pressed hard enough.

### Gets Circumvented

#### Solves nothing, gets circumvented, and has no incentives for compliance

U.S.'s leadership role in the world. \"Trump\'s rejection of the Arms
Trade Treaty Is based on reality,\" TheHill, 5-23-2019,

The Arms Trade Treaty ([ATT]{.underline}), which President Donald Trump
announced on April 26 that the U.S. would quit, **[is a
failure]{.underline}**. When then-Secretary of State John Kerry signed
the ATT on behalf of the U.S. on September 25, 2013, hopes were high
among the treaty's friends that it would change the world. The
president's decision didn't crush those hopes. Reality did. The supposed
purpose of the ATT is to end irresponsible international arms sales. But
as one of the treaty's most distinguished defenders, former Assistant
Secretary of State Thomas Countryman, has admitted, **[its terms are
"clearly ambiguous."]{.underline}** In fact, **[it contains no
definitions at all]{.underline}**. None. Why is the treaty so vague?
[The ATT's negotiators wanted to get all the world's nations on board.
The only way to do this was to make the treaty **as vague as
possible**]{.underline}. [But treaties are contracts that bind the
United States. Being bound to vagueness is **inherently
dangerous.**]{.underline} [The ATT has **no rewards for
compliance**]{.underline}. The only thing you get from going along with
it is a warm feeling. **[It also has no enforcement
mechanism]{.underline}**. Given its defects, that's a good thing, but
relying on the fuzzies to create compliance isn't serious. [If nations
around the world want to not sell arms to dictators, all they need to do
is not sell. No treaty is necessary]{.underline}. If nations want to
control their borders to prevent illicit arms imports, the same is true.
[**We don't need a treaty. We need more democratic, competent
governments. Without them, no treaty can work.** With them, no treaty
will be necessary.]{.underline} The argument that progressives offer is
that if the U.S. stops making arms sales the left dislikes, this will
create influential "norms." **[If you truly believe that Russia will
become responsible if the U.S. simply does things that progressives
like, good luck to you.]{.underline}** But there is no basis for this
belief. It's a fantasy, and a self-disarming one at that. The
progressive focus on the U.S.'s arms sales isn't a coincidence. Iran's
arms sales don't much bother the treaty's advocates. But they really
hate the West's. If you doubt this, look at what they do. When the
progressive group behind the ATT wanted to quote a foreign condemnation
of the president's decision, to whom did they turn first? To Press TV,
the mouthpiece of the Iranian regime. The treaty's friends have sued the
British government to stop its arms sales. They leak assiduously against
the French government. They vehemently oppose U.S. arms sales, and ---
like Trevor Thrall in these pages --- support the treaty as a way to
stop those sales. But they do and say nothing about the dictators. When
Rachel Stohl, one of the treaty's most vehement defenders, wrote about
the missiles that shot down flight MH-17 in 2015, who did she blame for
supplying them? Vladimir Putin? No. She blamed "today's globalized
environment." The treaty's friends always condemn the U.S. in the
clearest terms. But when it comes to the dictators, out rolls the
poisonous fog of the passive voice in which no one is responsible for
anything. The treaty's friends have a blame-America-first policy. They
openly use the ATT as a weapon against the West, and only against it. In
practice, therefore, they are siding with Iran's mullahs, Putin and
Beijing. Worse, [the ATT is part of a **wider network of progressive
treaties,** including one on cluster munitions]{.underline}. That
treaty, according to Jim Shields, head of the U.S. Army's Program
Executive Office Ammunition, has created "capability gaps that we are
really concerned about." It is easy to say that the ATT will never
affect U.S. arms transfer policy. The history of the cluster munitions
treaty says otherwise. So do the lawsuits of the ATT's advocates
themselves. [The ATT is a treaty. A treaty is legal instrument. But arms
sales are decisions of **policy, not law.**]{.underline} [The decision
to authorize an arms sale should often be tough because the world isn't
black and white. It's mostly grey. Trying to impose a legal framework on
that reality is going to produce bad policy. There are lots of tough
calls in foreign policy]{.underline}. Being against the Arms Trade
Treaty isn't one of them.

#### Doesn't solve---US laws are already in line with the ATT

[The real goal of end use monitoring under the ATT -- **already a
longstanding component of U.S. arms export policy** -- is to ensure that
exported weapons end up and remain in the possession of the intended
recipients and that the companies and governments that purchase the
weapons are in fact responsible customers.]{.underline} Far from
requiring the United States to change its policies, **[the treaty in
fact did not require any change to U.S. policies.]{.underline}** [In
many respects the ATT is simply an effort to encourage other nations to
upgrade their arms exports policies **to match existing U.S.
standards**]{.underline}. The treaty poses no threat to the right to
bear arms.

**[Disarmament after conflict: a gender perspective]{.underline}**

[Since the proliferation of firearms affects women in such specific
ways, it is logical to assume that disarmament policies should be
carefully gender-aware in their approach]{.underline}. **[Yet in
reality, the technical management of SALW is an area in which masculine
expertise and opinions are absolutely privileged.]{.underline}**
[Disarmament in a post-conflict situation is defined as "the collection,
control and dispersal" of various kinds of weapons, light and heavy, as
well as "the development of responsible arms management
programs"]{.underline} (DPKO, 2000 p. 15). As sensible as it sounds,
[this approach implies that weapons control can be undertaken in a
rational and orderly manner in a post-conflict period, and that
gun-holders will willingly give up their weapons and develop arms
management structures]{.underline} in the interests of peace. Yet,
[since the ownership and utilization of arms is profoundly attached to
perceptions of masculinity in many cultures, **successful disarmament
support will only be likely if cultural constructions of manliness are
squarely addresse**d]{.underline}. **[This has implications for how
disarmament programs are designed and implemented.]{.underline}** The
circumstances of the conflict, the extent to which traditional control
mechanisms have broken down, and the degree to which armed men have
learned to rely on violence to secure their economic interests and
social status, will also dictate whether rational arms control programs
are possible.

More widely, **[UN Security Council-mandated arms embargoes have been

political interference and even retaliation for

[leave vacuums filled by brokers routinely evading such
embargoes]{.underline}. Even partially fulfilled deliveries reap
substantial monetary rewards. And some large consignments are bartered
for precious resources, as in the CAR. [The impartial, reliable and
consistently disaggregated data acquisition needed to distinguish
legitimate SALW transfers remains remote in the Middle East, the Sahel
states and, further south, in Central Africa. But neither is systematic
data acquisition available for major SALW flows occurring between major
producers themselves. Deficiencies include the absence or incomplete
recording of sales, authorisation of transactions and the lack of the
intergovernmental co-operation necessary for best practice
compliance.]{.underline} Not unknown is the absence of official empathy
towards those suffering the grave humanitarian consequences of unbridled
SALW transfers: [what goes unverified, reported or publicised renders
indifference.]{.underline} Lacking as well is continuous data collection
on illegal or clandestine arms flows, primarily to non-state armed
groups, although difficulties in consistently monitoring such movements
remain substantial. [SALW information is not disaggregated in Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) databases, **while that
supplied to the UN Comtrade Statistics database is provided on a
voluntary, selective basis**]{.underline}. Substantial suppliers
including North Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Iran fail to supply
data, some re-exporters including Saudi Arabia likewise.85 Hard to
dispute is one observer's conclusion that **[the arms industry would
prefer to avoid both the administrative burden of reporting and open
public scrutiny of its activities]{.underline}**.86

But even the Obama Administration recognized that "not getting a
universal \[ATT\] agreement would make any agreement less than
useless."16 [Today, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and many other
major arms exporters and importers are not party to the
ATT]{.underline}. By the U.S.'s own criterion, **[the ATT is therefore
"less than useless."]{.underline}** This is because, **[to the extent
that the treaty reduces arms exports from the West, it can only have the
perverse effects of driving potential importers to buy from China or
Russia]{.underline}**---or to develop their own indigenous arms
industries that will not fall under the treaty's purview. As a result of
these facts, **[the ATT deservedly lacks support in
Congress]{.underline}**. A bipartisan group of 55 current Senators, led
by Senator Jerry Moran (R--KS), has signed letters opposing the ATT. A
series of appropriations acts (most recently, Section 534 of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017) have banned implementation
funding, as does Section 1279B of the fiscal year 2018 National Defense
Authorization Act. The House, led by Representative Mike Kelly (R--PA)
has repeatedly opposed the treaty. The Republican Party Platform adopted
on July 19, 2016, explicitly rejects it. When the Obama Administration
transmitted the ATT, Senator Bob Corker (R--TN), the chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that "nothing has changed
over the last four years to suggest the treaty is in our national
interest, and it will remain dead in the water." In October 2017, the
U.S. abstained in a vote on the treaty in the U.N. First Committee.

### K of ATT

#### The ATT is a rubberstamp that legitimates violence

**Stavrianakis 16** (Anna Stavrianakis, Lecturer in International
Relations at the University of Sussex. Her main research interests are
NGOs and global civil society, the arms trade and military
globalization, and critical approaches to the study of international

[The US government's claims to universalism, responsibility and
morality, meanwhile, were more unilateralist and interest-based in
character]{.underline}. [Its delegation was much more explicit about
bringing the rest of world up to its 'responsible' standards for
'legitimate' transfers,69 with its system understood as 'the "gold
standard" of export controls']{.underline}.70 The ATT would serve as a
'trifecta' of peace, security and human rights for the USA.71 [US arms
transfers are carried out for 'one main reason: to further US national
security interests' -- they are 'an unequivocal signal to those who seek
to counter US interests or undermine international
norms'.]{.underline}72 [This alignment of US interests with
international norms serves to elide the empirical patterns]{.underline}
identified earlier [and there is a clear political move at stake, which
is much more acceptable in US political speech]{.underline} than in
British: 'the regulatory elegance of export control systems aside, it is
the arms transfer policies of governments that matter most'.73 In
January 2014 the White House announced the first Presidential Policy
Directive on conventional arms transfer policy since 1995. While 'the
importance of protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights hasn't
changed', it needed to be 'more prominently reflected'.74 [A norms-based
argument might argue that the fact the US government feels the need to
reflect it more prominently is a positive effect of the
ATT]{.underline}. **[But the government was simultaneously clear that
the ATT will make no difference to its practice, and has been enacting
an Export Control Initiative that further streamlines export
licensing.]{.underline}** [In this, 'less sensitive' items will be moved
to a Commerce Control List away from a Military List, putting 'higher
fences round fewer items' but also leading to less statutory involvement
of Congress in decision making and a re-categorisation of lists
primarily based on military threats to the USA, '**diminishing the
ability to use the controls to deny exports to human rights
abusers'**]{.underline}.75 A focus on two specific cases -- arms
transfers to Egypt during the Arab Spring, and intra-Western transfers
for use in liberal wars of choice -- illustrates the argument in more
detail. [Discourses of risk have been embedded into arms trade
regulation, yet the continuities in US--UK practice suggest that they
serve a **primarily legitimating purpose**. The risk assessment process
allows liberal states to continue preparing for war and supporting
war-making institutions, capitalist development and restricted forms of
politics overseas, and simultaneously to claim the mantle of morality
and responsibility]{.underline}. Krause identifies a logic of
governmentality in arms control, in which forms of regulation burrow
deep into the domestic politics of states. Accompanying this has been a
'normative evolution' around 'who could legitimately use what kinds of
violence against which people or groups and under what circumstances."76
[While there are indeed increasingly complex and bureaucratised
processes of risk management around arms transfer regulation, this
supposed normative evolution has not restrained historically
long-standing patterns of liberal use of violence against nonliberal
societies, nor support for violence in the non-European
world]{.underline}. While the burgeoning literature on risk 'has shifted
security away from the register of war and violence',77 [the
incorporation of risk into arms trade regulation is better understood in
terms of the maintenance]{.underline} [of the legitimacy of war in the
West]{.underline}.78 This is not to say that modes of control have not

JKS)**

**[The Arms Sales Approval Process]{.underline}**

[On paper, the United States appears to have a robust procedure in place
to assess arms sales.]{.underline} Since 1976, [the Arms Export Control
Act has required that the executive branch conduct a risk assessment for
large government-to-government sales of]{.underline} major conventional
weapons (commercial sales of many small and light weapons are covered by
different rules). [Once a foreign government decides it would like to
buy an American system, it submits a letter of request. The request
kicks off an extensive process that runs through a variety of offices at
the Departments of Defense and State, as well as other
agencies]{.underline}. The Country Team Assessment is the American
government's official risk assessment and is intended to determine: how
the \[weapon\] will be used, how it contributes to the defense and
security goals of the partner nation and of the US, how it will change
the partner country's military capabilities, how the partner country
will protect and safeguard sensitive technology, and the partner
nation's human rights record. [Once approved, the matter is turned over
to Congress, which serves as an emergency brake for this process. Absent
sufficient congressional opposition in the form of a veto-proof
resolution of disapproval, the sale is made.]{.underline} **[In reality,
the outcome of this process is almost inevitably the same: approval.
Though the United States won't sell its latest technology to everyone,
it will sell most things to just about anyone.]{.underline}** Although a
full explanation of this is beyond the scope of our work, [three
possible reasons are worth noting. First, the benefits of arms sales are
obvious and immediate, while the negative consequences are often less
obvious,]{.underline} tend to emerge much later, and often receive
little media coverage. **[Second, there is no constituency in Washington
opposing arms sales]{.underline}**. [Presidents see them as a foreign
policy tool, Congress sees them as economically beneficial benefiting
its constituents economically, and the defense industry provides
financial encouragement all around through campaign
donations]{.underline}. Finally, [the United States has been the world's
leading arms exporter for so long that the presumption that arms sales
work seems to have become **ingrained in the national security
bureaucracy.**]{.underline}

[With over a thousand firms engaged worldwide, SALW production is
**competitive and fragmented,** notwithstanding major firm dominance
among key exporting states]{.underline}.78 Some consolidations occur
through major supplier partnerships, as between Israeli and Indian
producers. Closer integration through co-production reduces development
and production costs, encouraging equipment rationalisation and
standardisation. [These linkages spur ongoing SALW development, as
between the American defence contractor Raytheon and the Swedish firm
SAAB, developing upgraded weapons for infantry forces]{.underline}.79
[With shareholder interest uppermost, private contracting enterprises --
**utilising bureaucratic contacts, political lobbying and employment of
recently retired military personnel** -- have increasingly influenced
major SALW supplier decisions in the last decade.]{.underline} **[The
role of offsets cannot be ignored]{.underline}**. [These compensation
practices, or 'sweeteners', are required as conditions of purchase in
either government to government or commercial sales of defence articles
and services.]{.underline} Although the biggest concessions involve
major defence items such as ships and aircraft, [the use of offsets in
SALW]{.underline} trading handicaps transparency, [invites corruption
and compromises transactional structures.]{.underline} While the World
Trade Organisation bans offsets as selection criteria for government
procurements, significantly its rules exempt state parties from
providing relevant information on self- judged security grounds.80

However, it is important to mention that the [Chinese impact on the
economic and trade relations of nafta, considering the region as a
whole, have been exaggerated.]{.underline} In reality, it can be argued
that [the impact of China has been limited.]{.underline} From figure 5,
[we can see that China is an important partner of the three
countries,]{.underline} with shares of 14%, 7.6% and 9.2% in the United
States, Canada and Mexico markets, respectively. On the other hand, the
members of nafta still represent the largest share of trade with each
other. In the case of the United States, its two nafta partners had a
combined share of 29% of the market; for Canada, 65.9% and for Mexico
69.2%. When comparing the [Chinese export shares in each of the three
countries that make up nafta, it is clear that they are still much lower
than the export shares within the region.]{.underline}

#### Fill in inevitable---Mexico has been diversifying for years due to overwhelming U.S. influence

**González et al 2015** (González, Mendoza and Juanjuan, Universidad de

<http://www.analisiseconomico.azc.uam.mx/index.php/rae/article/view/70/67>)//kb

[Nevertheless, because of the excessive dependence on the US economy,
Mexico is likely to look for other countries in Latin America and in the
TransPacific countries, such as Japan and China, in order to explore
diverse diplomatic relationships to balance the overwhelming impact of
the USA]{.underline}. Besides, [in the age of globalization, **it's
impossible that the relationship of Mexico and the USA could remain
totally exclusive from third party influences.** In the long run, Mexico
should actively develop an economic and trade relationship with
countries outside North America,]{.underline} [to find a wider range of
opportunities.]{.underline} From the standpoint of geo-politics, the
impact of China on the Latin-American area is still limited and far from
challenging the status of the United States. As mentioned previously,
after nafta was established, the share of imports of the United States
in many areas is still greater in Mexico than in China. In addition,
there is not a unified criterion of the country members about the future
development of nafta. Latin American countries are actively developing
relations with China on consideration of balancing the influence of the
United States, but the factor which can really change the regional power
structure in the region is the establishment of regional agreements and
not external factors (China Center for Contemporary World Studies,
2012).

#### Non-UQ: China already sells a large number of small arms to Mexico

George **Castellano**,, 9-1-20**15**, \"China-Latin America Arms
Sales,\" Army University Press,
https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/July-August-2018/Gurrola-China/

[Understanding the evolution of China's total global arms exports and
its geographical distribution provides the necessary background to
highlight the recent shift to the Latin America arms
market]{.underline}. Both table 1 and figure 1 demonstrate the evolution
of China's arms exports. The table shows the delineations of China's
arms exports between years and percentages by geographical distribution.
[It is important to note the low amount of military sales and exchanges
between China and Latin America prior to 2000, especially when
considering the U.S. shift in foreign policy post-9/11. In contrast, the
period after 2000 is characterized by significant expansion into both
African and Latin American markets]{.underline}.13

Overall, [China's increased global arms exports indicate an "emergence
of a global strategy that attempts to extend China's economic,
political, and possibly military outreach]{.underline}."14 Figure 1
demonstrates China's enormous increase in global arms exports from 1990
to 2016. When comparing in five-year periods, China's global arms
exports saw a sharp increase of 88 percent from 1990 to 2015.15 Further,
during the 2011--2015 period, [China became "the third largest arms
exporter with \$8.5 billion in exports" behind both the United States
and Russia.16 Although the top recipients of Chinese arm sales are
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, it also expanded its customer base to
other regions, primarily Africa and Latin America.]{.underline}17

As noted in table 1 and figure 2, [China's entrance into the Latin
American arms market is relatively new (since 2000) and can be
considered as part of a new comprehensive strategy toward the
region]{.underline}. As such, [there are several noteworthy trends in
China's expansion of military engagement in Latin America. Prior to
2000, Chinese arms sales were limited to low-level equipment and
military supplies, such as small arms and uniforms.]{.underline}18

[A closer look at the evolution of imports by country demonstrates that
the growth in sales in the region is initially attributed to and
facilitated by a country's ideological tendencies, particularly in the
ALBA countries.]{.underline} As seen in figure 2, [ALBA member states
Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia comprise most of the market share of
arms imports from China]{.underline}. In its own publications, ALBA
identifies itself as an "anti-imperialist" and "anti-neoliberal"
organization that advocates for a socialist economic model.19 As a
U.S.-China Commission report notes, this highlights a possible
correlation with "anti-U.S. foreign policy orientation of the
purchasers."20 [Further, China's "nonintervention" policy makes arms
sales attractive for countries.21 Based on China's arms sales alone, one
can infer its intention in the region is to expand its political
influence while securing a future military presence in the
region.]{.underline}

Another factor that contributed to the increase in arms sales is China's
relative comparative advantage. For one, China's products are less
expensive than those offered by the traditional international arms
suppliers, such as the United States and Russia. [More recently, China
continues to make inroads into other nations besides the ALBA member
states.]{.underline}22 This indicates an emergence into the market as an
important actor. In 2009, "[Peru---a key economic partner for the United
States in the region and supporter of the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific
Partnership---purchased fifteen of China's FN-6 portable surface-to-air
missiles (SAMs) in a \$1.1 million deal, along with ten more of its
SAMs. Then, in 2013, it bought twenty-seven multiple rocket launchers in
a \$39 million deal."23 A potential breakthrough for Chinese arms sales
in the region came in 2015 when then Argentine president Christina
Fernández de Kirchner approved a major arms purchase. The agreement,
near \$1 billion in Chinese equipment, included "armored personnel
carriers, fighter jets, and navy vessels.]{.underline}"24However,
President Mauricio Macri, who is considered more pragmatic and moderate
than his predecessor, has adjusted several Sino-Argentine initiatives,
including placing the significantly large arms purchase on
hold.25 [Despite Argentina's deferment, these recent developments
indicate Chinese arms sales continue to make inroads with Latin American
militaries.]{.underline}

**[Russia has had a]{.underline}** long but **[superficial relationship
with Mexico]{.underline}**. [Despite regular diplomatic and commercial
relations since 1945]{.underline}, punctuated by periods of shared
antipathy toward the United States, **[the two countries have not
developed strong commercial or cultural ties]{.underline}**. [Except for
a brief period of activity at the height of the Cold War, featuring a
strong Soviet intelligence presence and limited arms sales, there is not
much to build on]{.underline}. It is not obvious how a victory by
leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) in the July 1 Mexican
presidential election would necessarily advance Russian goals in Mexico,
if those goals indeed exist. [Though diplomats from both countries
continue to mouth niceties about increasing trade,]{.underline}
apparently [few of their business people are listening]{.underline}.
[For the entire year of 2016, Russia and Mexico had \$1.7 billion in
trade]{.underline}. **[That is roughly equal to the value of goods that
cross the U.S.-Mexico border every 31 hours]{.underline}**. Although
Mexican president Peña Nieto discussed possible Russian investment in
the oil sector with President Putin last year, nothing has come of it.
[Mexico is Russia's 42th-largest export market, representing less than
half a percent of its exports, while Russia is just 44th on Mexico's
export list]{.underline}. [Mexico trades more in absolute terms with
neighboring Guatemala, a country about one-tenth the size of Russia and
more than twice as poor]{.underline}. **[Investment between the two
countries is so low it can barely be measured]{.underline}**. [In 2016,
Russian direct investment in Mexico was only \$2 million, which in the
same year almost could have purchased a 15-second Super Bowl
commercial]{.underline}. **[Mexico reported zero direct investment in
Russia]{.underline}**. Worldwide in 2016, Mexico pulled in over \$29
billion in foreign direct investment from the rest of the world. **[Even
the lucrative arms trade is missing from the Russia-Mexico bilateral
relationship]{.underline}**. **[Mexico last purchased Russian weaponry
in 2012]{.underline}**, a \$20 million order for Mi-8 transport
helicopters. **[From 2006 to 2016, it purchased a total of \$61 million
worth of weaponry]{.underline}**, all for Mi-8 helicopters. [This was a
small fraction of the \$1.7 billion in weapons from other countries,
principally the United States]{.underline}, Spain, and France.
**[Russian sales to Mexico over the last decade rank below those from
the Netherlands]{.underline}**. As a strategic outpost during the Cold
War, Mexico had some value to the Soviet Union. The Soviet's large
embassy, centrally located in a pleasant area of Mexico City not far
from the U.S. embassy (and close to fashionable expatriate
neighborhoods), served as a base for Russian spies. It also was where
Lee Harvey Oswald famously met with a KGB agent six weeks before he shot
President John F. Kennedy. But [since the fall of the Soviet empire in
1991, Russian diplomatic interest has waned]{.underline}. [Although
President Vladimir Putin has met twice with Mexican
presidents]{.underline} (in 2004 with Vicente Fox and in 2012 with
Enrique Peña Nieto), [high-level meetings are infrequent]{.underline}.
Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray made his first trip to Moscow in late
2017, the first since President Felipe Calderon's foreign minister,
Patricia Espinosa, visited in 2011.

Program and Eastern Europe is signing on for arms made in the good ol\'
US of A. But **the U.S. isn\'t stopping at limiting Russian influence
through arms sales, the American government is using the program to
limit arms sales from China too.**]{.underline} It\'s a function of the
State Department working hand-in-hand with the Pentagon in an effort to
project American economic power and military goodwill. [\"The goal is to
help our partners break away from the Russian supply chain \[and\]
logistics chain that allows Russian contractors and service personnel,
and Russian-manufactured spare parts onto either NATO allied bases or
partner military bases,\"]{.underline} a State Department official [told
Defense
One](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2019/05/us-countries-well-pay-you-ditch-russian-chinese-arms/157084/?oref=d-river).
[The countries signing on to the revitalized program can\'t just promise
not to buy Russian or Chinese weapons from now on. They will also need
to get rid of their old ones as well as purchase new American
replacements.]{.underline} So instead of gifting these countries a
hodgepodge of military arms or vehicles, the countries can invest in
American military power while getting rid of old systems and updating
their military capabilities. Some of the partner countries are still
using Soviet-built weapons. [In the past year, the U.S. State Department
has signed on six former Soviet Bloc countries to the program to the
tune of \$190 million, including Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Greece, North
Macedonia, and Slovakia. The program will even bring these countries up
to NATO standards in many areas. If successful, the U.S. will expand the
program beyond Eastern Europe to help other countries break free of
Chinese and Russian dependence.]{.underline}

### AT: Cartels

#### Link turn- Mexican DCS arms go to cartels

**Attkisson 11** (Sharyl Attkisson, CBS News investigative correspondent
based in Washington. \"Legal U.S. Gun Sales To Mexico Arming Cartels,\"
CBS News, 12-6-2011,
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/legal-us-gun-sales-to-mexico-arming-cartels/)//Bennerz

[Selling weapons to Mexico - where cartel violence is out of control -
is controversial because so many guns fall into the wrong hands due to
incompetence and corruption]{.underline}. [The Mexican military recently
reported nearly 9,000 police weapons \"missing.\"]{.underline} Yet [the
U.S. has approved the sale of more guns to Mexico in recent years than
ever before through a **program called \"direct commercial
sales.\"**]{.underline} It\'s a program that some say is worse than the
highly-criticized \"Fast and Furious\" gunrunning scandal, where U.S.
agents allowed thousands of weapons to pass from the U.S. to Mexican
drug cartels. CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson
discovered that [the official tracking all those guns sold through
\"direct commercial sales\" leaves something to be desired. One weapon -
an AR-15-type semi-automatic rifle - tells the story. In 2006, this same
kind of rifle - tracked by serial number - is legally sold by a U.S.
manufacturer to the Mexican military. **Three years later - it\'s found
in a criminal stash in a region wracked by Mexican drug cartel
violence**]{.underline}. That prompted a \"sensitive\" cable, uncovered
by WikiLeaks, dated June 4, 2009, in which the U.S. State Department
asked Mexico \"how [the AR-15\" - meant only for the military or
police - was \"diverted\" into criminal hands.]{.underline} And, more
importantly, where the other rifles from the same shipment went:
\"Please account for the current location of the 1,030 AR-15 type
rifles,\" reads the cable. There\'s no response in the record. [The
problem of weapons legally sold to Mexico]{.underline} - **[then
diverted to violent cartels]{.underline}** - **[is becoming more
urgent]{.underline}**. [That\'s because the U.S. has quietly authorized
a massive escalation in the number of guns sold to Mexico through
\"direct commercial sales.\" It\'s a way foreign countries can acquire
firearms faster and with less disclosure than going through the
Pentagon.]{.underline} Here\'s how it works: A foreign government fills
out an application to buy weapons from private gun manufacturers in the
U.S. Then the State Department decides whether to approve. And it did
approve 2,476 guns to be sold to Mexico in 2006. In 2009, that number
was up nearly 10 times, to 18,709. The State Department has since
stopped disclosing numbers of guns it approves, and wouldn\'t give CBS
News figures for 2010 or 2011. **[With Mexico in a virtual state of war
with its cartels, nobody\'s tracking how many U.S. guns are ending up
with the enemy.]{.underline}** \"I think most Americans are aware that
there\'s a problem in terms of the drug traffickers in Mexico, increases
in violence,\" said Bill Hartung, an arms control advocate with the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. \"I don\'t
think they realize that [we\'re sending so many guns there, and that
some of them may be diverted to the very cartels that we\'re trying to
get under control]{.underline}.\" [The State Department audits only a
tiny sample - less than 1 percent of sales - but the results are
disturbing: In 2009, **more than a quarter**]{.underline} (26
percent**[) of the guns sold to the region that includes Mexico were
\"diverted\" into the wrong hands]{.underline}**, or had other
\"unfavorable\" results. The National Shooting Sports Foundation\'s
Larry Keane, who speaks for gun manufacturers, said he understands the
potential for abuse. \"**[There have been 150,000 or more Mexican
soldiers defect to go work for the cartels, and I think it\'s safe to
assume that when they defect they take their firearms with
them]{.underline}**,\" Keane told CBS News. But Keane said the sales
help the U.S. \"These sales by the industry actually support U.S.
national security interests,\" Keane told Attkisson. \"If they didn\'t,
the State Department wouldn\'t allow them.\" \"Do they need better
oversight?\" asked Attkisson. [\"It\'s certainly for the State
Department]{.underline} and the Mexican government [to try to make sure
that the cartels don\'t obtain firearms that way]{.underline},\" he
replied. \"But that\'s really beyond the control of the industry.\"
**[Mexico is now one of the world\'s largest purchasers of U.S. guns
through direct commercial sales]{.underline}**, beating out countries
like Iraq. The State Department office that oversees the sales wouldn\'t
agree to an interview. But an official has told Congress their top
priority is to advance national security and foreign policy.

#### Small arms via DCS fuels cartel violence

**Yang 17** (Yixuan Yang, expert in international relations. \"Disec I:
Proliferation Of Small Arms And Light Weaponry,\" Shorthand, 2-24-2017,
https://social.shorthand.com/ymuntaiwan/ug53Pq2PhT/disec-i-proliferation-of-small-arms-and-light-weaponry)//Bennerz

The videos make a few important points. **[A large proportion of US
firearm flows to Mexico is completely legal through direct commercial
sales, but more than a quarter]{.underline}** (2009 numbers) **[are
diverted into the hands of non-state actors such as drug
cartels]{.underline}**. [Some of them arise as many Mexican military
members defect to the cartels, bringing their weapons with them. Others
are stolen, intercepted or lost, thus entering the black market trade.
**These SALW fuel cartel violence**\--Mexico's homicide rate is five
times that of the US. Local law enforcement is weak in the face of such
rampant violence]{.underline}. The government struggles to provide its
police officers with enough resources, funds and protection from the
dangerous drug cartels. Moreover, [police corruption is a serious
problem - an estimated 63 percent of Mexicans do not trust their
municipal police force]{.underline}, while [66 percent view them as
corrupt]{.underline}. [In the face of tempting bribes and more
importantly, threats to themselves and their family, police officers
often find it easier to collaborate with cartels instead]{.underline} .
This makes it even more difficult to monitor the sales and circulation
of SALW.

#### Arms sales to Mexico end up being used in homicides and human rights violations

Arms sales are a pivotal element of U.S. policy with regard to Mexico,
motivated largely by the "war on drugs." [This military approach to
combating drug trafficking has led to a dramatic escalation of homicides
in Mexico since 2007, making it the second-most deadly armed conflict in
the world in 2015.34 And the Mexican government is responsible for
flagrant abuses of human rights, including forced disappearances,
torture, and extrajudicial killings]{.underline}, as documented by the
U.S. Department of State, Inter-American Human Rights Commission, and
Mexico's National Human Rights Commission. [Victims are
disproportionately indigenous people and migrants]{.underline}.
**[Collaboration between organized criminal groups and the Mexican state
is also extensively documented at the local, state, and federal
levels]{.underline}**, leading observers such as journalist Anabel
Hernández to call Mexico a "criminal state" that lacks legitimacy. 35
**[Arms sales to Mexican government forces escalate violence between the
state and criminal organizations]{.underline}**. [At the same time, tens
of thousands of weapons have gone missing from Mexican police
inventories]{.underline}. In a 2014 directive on conventional arms
transfers, the Obama administration states that the U.S. should maintain
"the appropriate balance between legitimate arms transfers to support
U.S. national security and that of our allies and partners, and the need
for restraint against the transfer of arms that would enhance the
military capabilities of hostile states, serve to facilitate human
rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law, or
otherwise undermine international security." Clearly, the balance has
tipped far from the need to restrain violations of human rights and
humanitarian law.

### AT: Mexico Relations

#### Tariffs and Immigration conflicts proves that AMLO won't backlash

**Antelo 6/11/19** (Cristina Antelo, 6-11-2019, \"Why won\'t Mexican
President López Obrador stand up to Trump?,\" TheHill,
<https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/447914-why-wont-mexican-president-lopez-obrador-stand-up-to-trump)//ICH-EC>

[At every turn, the U.S. Administration tramples]{.underline} (or at
least embarrasses) [our southern neighbor.]{.underline} First, [[Donald
Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) announced that he would
[build the wall and make Mexico pay for
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-pay-wall.html)]{.underline}.
Then, [he slapped Mexico with steel and aluminum tariffs]{.underline}
and attempted to pull the rug out from under NAFTA. Now, he's blaming
Mexico for the U.S.'s faulty immigration system and threatened to add
[even more
tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs.html)
that would escalate throughout the summer. In his final days, former
Mexican President Peña Nieto (2012-2018) declared that "[nothing and no
one stands above the dignity of
Mexico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/05/mexico-president-trump-dignity-504613)."
Vicente Fox, another former President of Mexico (2000-2006), was even
more candid: "[I'm not paying for that freaking
wall!](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vicente-fox-mexico-president-donald-trump-jordan-klepper_n_5a683e5ae4b0dc592a0dd58f)"
Only he didn't say "freaking." But President [A]{.underline}ndrés
[M]{.underline}anuel [L]{.underline}ópez [O]{.underline}brador, known
colloquially as Amlo, [has said... well, **nothing**.]{.underline} Could
he be holding his breath for the passage of the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), at which point he will unleash a
stream of expletives on Twitter? That is a popular theory with pundits
in Washington, but I'm not buying it. I think that [Amlo is disinclined
to butt heads with Trump because the two are eerily
similar.]{.underline} Despite his leftism, [Amlo sees qualities in
Trump's leadership style and economic agenda that he respects and even
emulates.]{.underline} Amlo's campaign promise to "[purify public
life](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/02/amlo-promises-to-purify-public-life-as-he-assumes-mexican-presidency)"
was strikingly reminiscent of Trump's statement at the 2016 RNC: "[I
alone can fix
it](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/trump-rnc-speech-alone-fix-it/492557/)."
[The actions Amlo took in his [first 100
days](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/amlo-100-days-impressing-radical-change-and-building-unrestrained-power)
have been accompanied by heaps of messianic rhetoric. Both presidents
constantly imply that the problems faced by citizens will be rectified
by the president himself, not the government as a democratic
institution. Both]{.underline} leaders have also [expressed disdain for
federal agencies and balances of power]{.underline}, all while touting
reputations as decidedly and unapologetically nationalistic. Most
recently, [Amlo's political party concocted a plan to restructure the
11-person Supreme Court to his advantage]{.underline} by [adding 5 more
justices](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-report/mexico-morena-coalition-seeks-constitutional-reform-expand-supreme-court).
When it comes to international relations, [Trump and Amlo verge on
isolationism and show a disturbing inclination to support undemocratic
power. Trump has been downright affectionate towards [Kim
Jong-un](https://thehill.com/people/kim-jong-un),]{.underline} Supreme
Leader of North Korea[, and [Vladimir
Putin](https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin)]{.underline}, Russian
President (and infamous election meddler). Meanwhile, [Amlo has [chosen
to back Venezuelan President Nicolás
Maduro](https://www.cfr.org/blog/amlos-venezuela-neutrality-anything)]{.underline},
whose authoritarian grip on that country exacerbates an ongoing
humanitarian crisis. I will concede that nationalism and disdain for
checks and balances are not new concepts, nor are they uniquely
Trumpian. In fact, in recent years, world leaders with these qualities
have reared their heads on every continent, even in countries where
Trump is loathed. But [the Trump-Amlo duo has another concerning
similarity: Both are promoting short-sighted economic agendas that are
trapped in the past. Amlo's strategy]{.underline} to re-vamp the economy
[hinges on]{.underline} the [construction of an [\$8 billion dollar oil
refinery](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-refinery/mexicos-president-elect-sets-out-plan-for-new-8-billion-oil-refinery-idUSKCN1LK2V0)]{.underline}.
He claims that building another mega-refinery will increase Mexico's oil
production and sustain the economy, an economic strategy from the 1960s.
But the six existing refineries in Mexico are operating at [30 percent
of their total
capacity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-28/mexico-s-oil-refineries-are-operating-like-it-s-1990-again),
the lowest output in three decades. Why waste money on another refinery
when the country is underutilizing its current infrastructure? Not to
mention, Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company, would not have the
capacity to support the economy, even if seven refineries were fully
operational. [Amlo's refinery plan is similar to Trump's emphasis on the
coal industry. Most Americans have gladly shifted away from
coa]{.underline}l in favor of cleaner, more efficient, and more
sustainable energy, y[et the administration vows to reboot mining
efforts.]{.underline} As Trump denies the science behind climate change
to promote the industry, [coal-fired power plants continue to shut
down](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2019/04/14/trump-vowed-to-save-coal-but-u-s-largest-mining-basin-sees-decline/#7a50eb171d74)
to make way for more economical production methods. Why would he dig his
heels into an energy source that is inferior in every way? [Both Trump
and Amlo are appealing to a base]{.underline}. The two are more
interested in policies that make statements than policies that actually
move the economy forward. Building a populist base of support is key to
consolidating power, and that mentality lends itself to short-sighted
economic policy. Last July, in a classic outburst of narcissism, [Trump
privately referred to Amlo as "Juan
Trump,"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/09/trump-referred-to-mexicos-incoming-leader-as-juan-trump-former-white-house-official-says/?utm_term=.e4a2c72e4bd6)
declaring the newly-elected president to be his Mexican equivalent.
Amlo's staunchly anti-neoliberal supporters rejected this nickname, but,
ironically, Trump was right in more ways than one. Both leaders are
undermining their own democratic institutions and failing to make
investments in the future of the North American economy. **[I don't
expect Amlo to stand up to Trump anytime soon, if at all.]{.underline}**
The two presidents are trapped in the 20th century and, ultimately,
enable one another.

#### Tariffs thump the link.

MEXICO CITY - [Mexico\'s government is trying to delicately negotiate
its way out of looming U.S. tariffs.]{.underline} But [many fear
that]{.underline} its [talks with]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [could break down, leading to]{.underline} a [backlash
here and long-term damage to the]{.underline} bilateral
[relationship.]{.underline} Senior-level delegations from both countries
met on Wednesday to try and reach a deal, and are scheduled to continue
their talkson Thursday. \"You always have to be optimistic, especially
in a difficult negotiation with lots of tension,\" said Mexican Foreign
Minister Marcelo Ebrard, after the two-hour meeting. \"We are going to
find some point of agreement as soon as possible.\" Mexican officials
are eager to make a deal - worrying that the tariffs threatened by
President Trump could further slow this country\'s lethargic economy
while also hurting U.S. businesses and consumers. At the same time, they
also must contend with a Mexican public that is irritated by what it
views as U.S. bullying. A poll published this week by the newspaper El
Financiero gave a sense of the narrow path Mexican leaders are treading.
An overwhelming number of respondents - 84 percent - said the nation
should support President Andrés Manuel López Obrador\'sdiplomatic drive.
But only 40 percent thought Mexico should cut off the flow of
unauthorized migrants as Trump has demanded. \"Regardless of how this
story ends, Trump could scupper US-Mexico relations and lose #Mexico as
a strategic partner and ally,\" wrote Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican
ambassador to the United States, in a tweet. [Trump]{.underline} has
[threatened to impose tariffs]{.underline} starting at 5 percent and
gradually rising to 25 percent on all Mexican exports to the United
States unless Mexican authorities prevent U.S.-bound Central Americans
from crossing their country. López Obrador, a leftist who took office in
December, has sought to maintain smooth relations with the U.S.
president. Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday that progress had been
made in the talks - \"but not nearly enough!\" [He said the talks would
continue on Thursday \"with the understanding that, if no agreement is
reached, Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday.\" **Mexican
officials have largely avoided discussion of retaliatory
steps**]{.underline} they could take. They could slap their own tariffs
on U.S.products, potentially increasing pressure on Trump to cut a deal.
The leader of a major Mexican agricultural association, Bosco de la
Vega, said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs should be met with equal measures
by Mexico. \"It\'s right for Mexico to negotiate and be prudent, but
when the aggression is so strong and unjustified, we will have to
respond,\" he told the newspaper El Universal. In the recent newspaper
poll, 57 percent of respondents wanted Mexico to strike back with its
own taxes on U.S. goods. [Trump\'s gambit has threatened to upend plans
by the U.S. and Mexican congresses to ratify the updated version of the
North American Free Trade Agreement.]{.underline} The tariffs could
become the biggest bilateral crisis yet for U.S.and Mexican leaders.
Mexico is heavily dependent on trade with the United States - the
destination of 80 percent of its exports. \"The bilateral relationship
could be harmed for a long time\" if an agreement is not reached soon,
said Gustavo Mohar, a former top intelligence and migration official in
Mexico. \"President Trump is sending a very worrying signal about what
Mexico faces while he\'s in the White House.\" [El Financiero\'s poll
found that only 16 percent of those surveyed expressed a favorable view
of bilateral relations, compared with 33 percent in March.]{.underline}
The White House has not said exactly what it expects from Mexico. The
Mexican delegation to the talks has not tipped its hand on what it may
offer. But s[enior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have
said they want Mexico to strengthen security on its border with
Guatemala and intensify its investigation of smuggling rings that
transport most migrants across Mexican territory.]{.underline}

### AT: Econ Impacts

#### Mainstream economics is structured by Homo economicus, which is dependent on detached and gendered notions of economic agency 

**Hagengruber 16**

**(Ruth, University of Paderborn, Springer International Publishing
Switzerland 2016 171 M.C. Amoretti and N. Vassallo (eds.),
Meta-Philosophical Reflection on Feminist Philosophies of Science,
Boston Studies in the Philosophy and History of Science 317, DOI
10.1007/978-3-319-26348-9_10, JKS)**

[The science of economics conceptualizes itself as a value-free and
universal methodical approach used to describe self-interested actions
by the agents in a market, which is defined as a place for the exchange
of goods.]{.underline} The description of this process does not need to
include values or evaluative standpoints, however it does not deny that
economic agency is restricted and shaped by normative topics. A Jewish
society differs from the action parameters of a Moslem society, this
from a Buddhist, a Confucian and a Christian one, and so on. Science
itself is not bothered by these preconditions. For the different
societies it is true that women are not equally present, neither as
producers of economic output nor as economic agents[. Women are excluded
as agents in the market and]{.underline} thus [excluded from the
relevant positioning of their interests]{.underline} (Strassmann 1997:
viii). [The]{.underline} sheer [fact that women are not visible within
the different economic realms is not problematized within the systems
themselves. The fact of their absence and the inferior valuation of
their contribution to the Gross National Products worldwide is taken to
be a result of their lack of participation and a consequence of women's
role in society, stereotyping them into activities which are not
regarded as being a part of economic productivity]{.underline}.
Nonetheless, **[the rational economic agent is perceived to be
gender-neutral]{.underline}** (Ferber and Nelson 2003; Strassmann 1993;
Justman 1996). The [homo oeconomicus is a **preference-selecting
person**, an autonomous individual]{.underline} acting [in abstract
circumstances,]{.underline} "in society [without being influenced by
society," and acting in an "ideal market]{.underline}" without realizing
the ostracisms and segregations that shape this market (Nelson 1995).
[Although economic science claims that the homo oeconomicus is a
universal model of economic action, it regards the predicates of
autonomy and context-free action capacity as]{.underline} particularly
[masculine and is convinced that these concepts are]{.underline}
justifiably [dominant over culturally feminine predicates, like interde-
pendency, interconnectivity and concreteness]{.underline}. Albeit the
economic man is predi- cated as a universal one, it is a particular
identity, built upon exploitation and discrimination (Barker and Kuiper
2003: 9). Cultural organization has placed one at the market place, the
other in the house. Often these two kinds of activities are presented as
being opposite. When they are designed to be complementary, this is not
relevant for the market. The assumption of perfect competition in the
market turns out to be irrelevant for the comple- mentary activities of
the gendered production endeavors. On the contrary, [the market is a
male segregation locus, supported by women and caregivers, who
provide]{.underline} important [labor to support the]{.underline}
productivity in the [market]{.underline} (Waring 1988: 14).
**[Mainstream economics presents itself as a result of abstract, free
and independent individual actions and ignores]{.underline}** the fact
that **[its categories depend on the cultural contexts and social norms
which comprise a nation]{.underline}**, with religion shaping the
determining conditions and traits on the paths which economics has
developed and has not overcome but confirmed. It ignores the fact that
its knowledge belongs to epistemic communities (Strassmann 1993; Longino
1993; Nelson 1993). Preference economics has disregarded important
elements that influence the eco- nomic process, shape preferences and
thus lead to a tautology of self-confirming effectiveness (Hagengruber
2000). Elementary economic principles that should guarantee the
transparency of action, equal access to the market, preference for the
best, are ignored and even contradicted by this practice. These kinds of
social patterns are realized in preference and utility-functions and
deepen the traps of cultural backgrounds. Choice theory is built upon
tautology and a consequentialist attitude (Dunleavy 1991; Seiz 1999).
This way, **[economic actions perpetuate segregation habits, allowing
the maximum benefit from]{.underline}** this kind **[of oppression and
segregation]{.underline}** (McCloskey 1998). Stating that these kinds of
values enter into eco- nomic analysis, as every choice is the expression
of personal value, the value judgments in all aspects of economics must
be considered (van Staveren 2007). There are elementary parts in
economic theory which are inherently qualitative. [Economics, like any
science, is referring to social constructions that shape its
theory]{.underline} (Nelson 1995). The [aim of feminist research on
economic concepts is thus to identify these social and cultural
constructions that privilege male interpretations of economic
issues]{.underline}, identifying where these forms of dominance and
subjection tend to devaluate women in the economic realm (Power 2004).
The market is dependent on provisioning activities which are not part of
itself. [These are gendered social activities, performed mostly in favor
of the male of the house and performed by the females. The
sex-segregating labor implies the per- formance of domestic work, care
work, subsistence work such as that of the male dependent worker, with
unpaid or lower paid labor and even "voluntary" work, often connected to
personal and emotional interaction]{.underline}. This social provisional
work ---although necessary and also acknowledged as such---has presented
a challenge to mainstream economics as the traditional image of the
economic man is shaped as the autonomous and self-interested individual.
Consequently, the thus constituted homo economics negated this
provisional work as a market relevant action, as neoclassic economics
did in demarcation to classic and ancient economics. Although
provisional labor is a substantial and necessary part of every market
participation and participant, it is excluded as fact-relevant labor and
not counted as a relevant input for the homo oeconomicus to present
himself in the market.

#### Financial crisis narratives rely on gendered underpinnings which displace the social reproduction that is required to make financing possible 

**Roberts 16**

**(Adrienne Roberts, Lecturer in IR at the U. of Manchester, Chapter 4
in Scandalous Economics, Finance, Financialization, and the Production
of Gender, edited by Aida Hozic and Jacqui True, pgs 59-61, Hardback,
JKS)**

[One problem]{.underline} with the three narratives noted in the
previous section [is their framing of the extension and deepening of
finance as a natural and inevitable outcome of technological progress
that is largely de-linked from broader relations of power and
production. They also rely on a modernizationist approach to development
whereby it is assumed that the extension and deepening of finance will
ultimately integrate the \"excluded\" into a more sophisticated sphere
of political and economic development.]{.underline} A third limitation
of these approaches is that **[they tend to see structures of gender as
operating alongside markets, rather than being an integral part of these
historically specific social relations]{.underline}**. In contrast, the
feminist historical materialist perspective underlying this chapter
understands the extension and deepening of finance, the interlinked
discourses/practices of development, and gender relations to be firmly
located within historically constituted social relations of power,
production, and social reproduction (Bakker and Gill 2003). That is,
rather than seeing the growth and deepening of finance as a natural and
inevitable outcome of human \"progress,\" from a historical materialist
perspective, different forms of production emerge as dominant in
different historical moments. These forms of production do not emerge
naturally, or even as the inevitable result of technological change, but
rather are connected to historically specific configurations of power
relations (2003, 26). Thus, for instance, [the dominant form of
production, or what we might think of as power-production, in any
particular historical period is deeply shaped by the form of the state,
by the structures of ownership and control that are in
place]{.underline} (i.e., legal regulations protecting private
property), and relations between labor and capital. As Bakker and Gill
explain, a feminist historical materialist analysis draws attention to
the ways in which forms of power-production are also fundamentally
mediated by structures of gender inequality, along with structures of
racialization and sexuality (2003, 26). To put it differently, [rather
than seeing relations of production and gender relations as separate,
from a feminist historical materialist perspective, power-production
relations operate through structural hierarchies of class, gender, race,
sexuality, and so on]{.underline}. In terms of finance-based relations
of production and accumulation, **[the Crucial point to stress is that
finance is not a gender-neutral technical or pseudo-scientific tool or
technique that is used in the allocation of assets and liabilities
across time and space.]{.underline}** Rather, [finance is deeply bound
up with structures of gender.]{.underline} These intersections [include
the gendered underpinnings of financial modelling (]{.underline}i.e.,
the [privileging of the \"rational\" and \"utility-maximizing"
individual, who is implicitly male]{.underline} England 1993; Beneria
2003), [gender-based inequalities in wealth and asset ownership (which
may be reproduced by regressive tax systems]{.underline} (Deere and Doss
2006, Deere, Alvarado, and Twyman 2010; Montgomerie and Young 2010;
Roberts 2013), the rewarding of Certain masCulinized forms of behavior
(such as aggressiveness and risk-taking) in the field of finance
(McDowell 1997; De Goede 2005), and the positioning of men in the
majority of top positions in the institutions of global financial
governance (Schuberth and Young 2011). [In addition to understanding
power-production as intersecting with structures of gender, feminist
historical materialism understands powerproduction to be inseparable
from relations of social reproduction.]{.underline} In one oft-cited
definition, Cindi Katz describes social reproduction as \"the fleshy,
messy, and indeterminate stuff of everyday life" (2001, 711). In her
important work on the topic, Isabella Bakker has explained that [markets
cannot function without the underlying work of social reproduction,
which includes the work associated with]{.underline} (a) [biological
reproduction (]{.underline}including social constructions of
[motherhood);]{.underline} (b) [the reproduction, Socialization, and
education of the labor force; and]{.underline} (c) [the reproduction and
provisioning of care]{.underline} (Bakker 2007, 541; see also Katz 2001;
Bakker 2003; Bezanson and Luxton 2006).

### AT: Prolif Impacts

#### Proliferation discourse is deeply gendered and racialized- it is epistemologically laden with gendered imagery that makes states compete for power

¶ ["Proliferation" is not a mere description or mirror of a phenomenon
that is "out there" but rather a very specific way of identifying and
constructing a problem concerning weapons.]{.underline} Proliferation,
as used in Western political discourse, does not simply refer to the
"multiplication" of weapons of mass destruction on the planet. Rather,
[it constructs some WMD as a problem, and turns an]{.underline}
~~blind~~ [eye to others]{.underline}. **[With nuclear weapons, for
example, it is able to do this by assuming pre-existing, legitimate
possessors, implicitly not only entitled to those weapons, but to
modernise and develop new generations of them as well]{.underline}**.
[The "problematic" nuclear weapons are only those that "spread" into the
arsenals of other, formerly non-possessor states. This is the basis for
the "licit/illicit" distinction commonly found in arms control
discourse]{.underline}, which does not refer to the nature of the
weapons themselves, nor even to the purposes for which they are
intended, but on who possesses them. **[The nuclear non-proliferation
regime enshrined "we got there first" as a basis for arms
control.]{.underline}** Most people in the world view WMD as
intrinsically morally indefensible, no matter who possesses them. In
addition to the abhorrence attached to their use, the wide array of
social, economic, political and health costs associated with their
development and deployment are repugnant. Rejecting proliferation
discourse's implicit division of "good" and "bad," "safe" and "unsafe"
WMD, (defined as such depending on who possesses them), it is imperative
now to understand how some WMD are rendered invisible or benign (ours)
and others visible and malignant (theirs). [In drawing a distinction
between "the Self" and the (generally non-Western) "Unruly Other", the
prevailing arguments against proliferation appear patronising,
ethno-racist and contemptuous. Not only does non-proliferation discourse
draw on Occidentalist portrayals of third world actors; it does so
through the medium of **gender-laden terminology**]{.underline}. For
example, [the nuclear possessors' Self is responsible, prudent,
rational, advanced, mature, restrained, technologically and
bureaucratically competent]{.underline} (and thus "hegemonically
masculine"). By contrast[, the Unruly Others are irrational,
unpredictable, emotional, uncontrolled, immature, primitive,
undisciplined, incompetent, technologically backward]{.underline} (marks
of an inferior or "subordinated" masculinity). Hence the [terms of the
debate are constructed to normalise and legitimate the Self/possessor
states keeping weapons that the Others must be prevented from
acquiring]{.underline}. **[By drawing on and evoking gendered imagery
and resonances, the discourse naturalises the idea that "We" (the
responsible father or sheriff) must protect, control and limit the
"uncivilised", out-of control "rogue" states -- for their own
good]{.underline}**, as well as for ours. This Western proliferation
discourse has had a function in the wider context of US national
security politics. With the end of the "Evil Empire" of the Soviet Union
in the late 1980s, until the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United
States appeared to be without an enemy sufficiently threatening to
justify maintaining its sprawling military-industrial establishment.
This difficulty for the military-industrial complex was forestalled by
the construction of the category of "rogue states", with governments
portrayed as uncontrollable, irresponsible, irrational, malevolent, and
antagonistic to Western values. Their unruliness and hostility is
represented as intrinsic to their irrational nature, for to view the
antagonism as politically rooted would have necessitated some
soul-searching analysis into the role of Western policies and actions in
contributing to disorder and breakdown in other states and regions. [The
discourse of WMD proliferation has been one of the principal means of
portraying certain states as major threats.]{.underline} To say this is
neither to back away from our position opposing all weapons of mass
destruction, nor to argue about the degree to which WMD in the hands of
"Other" states actually do threaten the United States, local
populations, regional neighbours or international security. The point is
that [the underlying gendered symbolism in the WMD proliferation
discourse helps make it feel natural and legitimate to fight wars and
spend money on military programmes such as ballistic missile defence,
which would otherwise be difficult to justify on rational security
grounds.]{.underline}

#### U.S. weapons enable Mexico's government to commit violence against grassroots movements and migrants

**AFSC 16** (American Friends Service Committee, Quaker founded
organization working for peace and social justice around the world,
conduct dozens of field research reports every year, employs
professionals in the relevant field, November, "Where the Guns Go: U.S.
Arms and the Crisis of Violence in Mexico,
<https://www.afsc.org/resource/report-where-guns-go>) IK

When Mexico's federal electoral tribunal declared Felipe Calderón the
winner of the presidential elections in 2006, millions of Mexicans
contested the election's validity in the streets of Mexico City and
elsewhere. After he took office, Calderón immediately sought to
legitimize his presidency by declaring a war on drug cartels and leaning
heavily on the Mexican military, whose forces he deployed into cities.
For Calderón, [the militarization of law enforcement and army operations
within the country did more than ally his administration with the
military. It also was a means to get the United States on board
economically as part of the drug war,]{.underline} through the \$3
billion Mérida Initiative, focused on building Mexico's police and
military. The presidency of Enrique Peña [Nieto]{.underline}, despite
early announcements of a change of course, [has continued the same
policies of military operations, especially focused on "high value
targets"---killing or arresting criminal leaders, leading to
fragmentation, competition, and further conflict between smaller
organizations. Mexican political leaders have other interests in
militarization, as well. **The Calderón and Peña Nieto governments have
responded with force to nonviolent grassroots mobilizations for
democracy and labor rights and against forced disappearances and other
state violence.**]{.underline} While our delegation was in Mexico,
federal police agents attacked unarmed participants in a teachers'
protest in Nochixtlán, Oaxaca on June 19, killing at least nine people.
Police snipers deployed to put down the protest used Belgian and Czech
assault weapons.31 [**Mexico also uses imported weapons to enforce the
Southern Border Plan that deports thousands of Central American
migrants, many of whom are fleeing violence**.]{.underline} Although
agents of the Mexican immigration enforcement agency INAMI are not
armed, immigrant rights defenders in Chiapas have documented frequent
INAMI operations with federal and state police and military agencies.
T[hose agencies are armed with U.S.-supplied weapons.]{.underline}
SEDENA controls all legal weapons imports into Mexico and markets them
to police, private security companies, and the military itself. Gun
possession by private citizens is highly restricted. During a visit by
members of our delegation to SEDENA's arms showroom, Col. Eduardo Tellez
Moreno, director of the Office of Weapons and Munitions Marketing, told
us that there is no uniform weapons purchasing plan for federal, state,
or local police. "It's like selling cars," he said. "People buy what is
popular." The absence of standardized purchasing means that state police
have arsenals that vary widely in country of origin, manufacturer, age,
and characteristics. [Mexican communities, of course, have an interest
in stopping the inflow of weaponry that is doing so much damage in the
absence of the rule of law or a government that protects its citizens
and others within its borders. "I would call on U.S. citizens to really
question weapons policy, the production and freedom and sale of weapons
from the United States to Mexico, to the Mexican
government,"]{.underline} said Manuel Olivares of the Morelos y Pavón
Human Rights Center in Guerrero. "The sale of these weapons is serving
to massacre people." "[All of us in Mexico know that this is not a war
against drug trafficking, but a war against the society, against our
families, and above all against our children,]{.underline}" María
Herrera told us. Four of her sons were forcibly disappeared. [Those
responsible for selling weapons to Mexico, she said, "should think about
the damage and destruction brought by these weapons, and that eventually
it will harm them as well, which in fact we are seeing."]{.underline}

### AT: Antiblackness- Coalition/Multiculturalism Links

#### Their narrow understanding of blackness erases the unique position of Afro-Latinas, whose movements are necessary to challenge gendered and racialized violence within contemporary Eurocentric frameworks -- the perm is key to centering inclusive and transnational histories. 

**Garsow, 2018** \[Melissa- Dept. of African American Studies @ Yale,
"Afro-Latin@ Nueva York: Maymie De Mena and the Unsung Afro-Latina
Leadership of the UNIA", *Afro-Latin@s in Movement Critical Approaches
to Blackness and Transnationalism in the Americas*, pp 141-170\]

As Asia Leeds has described, [the UNIA was a "redemptive diasporic" 112
movement that largely defi ned progress as a full human realization for
men, while relegating women to a supporting role and emphasizing the
reform of women's morals to more fully meet white middle-class
understandings of domesticity.]{.underline} 113 Maymie De [Mena's defi
ant performance of another kind of femininity (Joan of Arc) is
electrifying]{.underline}. Leeds comments, "[the]{.underline} political
[philosophy of Garveyism held women's bodies and behavior under heavy
surveillance, and in many ways affi rmed dominant framings of black
women's inherent sexual immorality]{.underline}." 114 In this respect,
[De Mena]{.underline} continually [negotiates the complex intersections
of Eurocentric constructions of "respectable" women's behavior and
roles, in the context of expectations about black women's uncontrolled
sexuality, and "redemptive" discourses about people in the not-yet
postcolonial African diaspora]{.underline}. [Yet she does so from a
unique Afro-Latina and moreover Central American perspective. In the
words of Marta Moreno Vega, "challenging both Eurocentric constructions
of Latin American identity and narrow US-centered constructions of
'black' identity in the Diaspora, Afro-Latinas/os are demanding their
place in history as purveyors of resistance and as the progeny of a deep
rooted legacy. **Afro-Latinas are indisputably at the heart and the helm
of this struggle**."]{.underline} 115 As many discussions of
Afro-Latinidad privilege people from the Spanish Caribbean, especially
stories from that time period, De Mena challenges a focus on Puerto
Ricans in New York while also broadening ideas of blackness across the
diaspora. As such, [Maymie]{.underline} [is]{.underline} both [an
important fi gure in her own right as well as a unique
theoretica]{.underline}l [tool for understanding and complicating the
workings of gender, race, ethnicity, and diaspora in early black
political organizations]{.underline}. In that vein, I hope to make one
fi nal provocation with regard to De Mena's and other Afro-Latinas'
historical utility. [In bringing together such vast intellectual spaces,
cultures, diasporas, and histories, Afro-Latinas provide us with one
further opportunity, the opportunity to tell a more inclusive
transnational history that equally values the contributions of women and
men.]{.underline}

#### Archives DA: the alt is unable to explain the position of Afro-Latina women who are forced to split their identities. 

**Garsow, 2018** \[Melissa- Dept. of African American Studies @ Yale,
"Afro-Latin@ Nueva York: Maymie De Mena and the Unsung Afro-Latina
Leadership of the UNIA", *Afro-Latin@s in Movement Critical Approaches
to Blackness and Transnationalism in the Americas*, pp 141-170\]

Maymie [De Mena played a crucial role at the helm of the
UNIA]{.underline} when the organization could have crumbled. Yet,
[despite her obvious importance, this highly popular and infl uential
organizer has yet to be written about other than as a
footnote]{.underline} or a brief example of the existence of female
leadership in the UNIA. 14 Perhaps [this is because writing about
Afro-Latinas is particularly tricky]{.underline}. As Ula Taylor has
described in her own work on Amy Jacques Garvey and the lesser-known Amy
Ashwood Garvey (Garvey's AFRO-LATIN@ NUEVA YORK: MAYMIE DE MENA... 143
fi rst wife and cofounder of the UNIA), [there exists a "crisis of
archival recognition for African American women" **whose material traces
are "limited, heavily tainted, or virtually nonexistent**."]{.underline}
15 [Afro-Latinas, at the margins of both African-American and Latino
histories, are doubly invisible]{.underline}. [Archives are not just
diffi cult to come upon, but often split between "black" and "Latino"
categories]{.underline} that further occult their existence, while
[their abilities as coalition builders are questioned under the
expectation of male charismatic leadership]{.underline}. As such, [this
chapter necessarily employs what Taylor describes as "historical
imagination" 16 to interpret the limited archives about De
Mena]{.underline}. Specifi cally, this research relies heavily on
spatial and political context to recreate the sights, sounds, smells,
and common experiences De Mena most likely had lived through to
interpret what is known about her. In the end, I conclude that De Mena
was not just a crucial fi gure for reinvigorating the Garvey movement in
the late 1920s and aiding its expansion into the Spanish-speaking world,
but an important example of the linkages that existed between Latino and
black communities. [I am not the fi rst to see Afro-Latinos as bridges,
but bridges in the 1920s and 1930s thus far have been associated
primarily with men. Here I argue De Mena serves as a bridge connecting
various intellectual spheres and communities to illuminate the
multicultural, multilingual world of 1920s and 1930s,]{.underline}
Harlem in particular, and New York City in general. [Recognizing that a
woman of color could very publicly build bridges between genders, across
ethnic and racial communities, and across countries as well, I hope,
opens the door to a hunt for more Afro-Latinas in US
history]{.underline}. Signifi cantly, De Mena, does not just provide a
link between blacks and Latinos, the United States and Latin America,
but between men and women. She was a feminist whose life and work also
raises questions not just about how men and women of color could
collaborate in a diffi cult time for many in Harlem and East Harlem, but
how black, Latina, and Afro-Latina women possibly supported each other
within and throughout male-dominated, masculinist organizations.

#### Feminist legal theory is necessary to deconstruct gendered underpinnings of gun regulation. The permutation is an intersectional framework

[Feminist legal theory (\"FLT\') is a powerful tool for examining the
Second Amendment because of its innate skepticism about the status
quo]{.underline}, its emphasis on context, and its recognition that
intersecting oppressions are especially relevant in analyzing a given
policy or practice. In brief, [FLT examines \"how gender has mattered to
the development of the law and how different groups of men and women are
differentially affected by the power of law.\"]{.underline} 2 2 In so
doing, [FLT critiques legal doctrines to uncover hidden biases, identify
how male supremacy is reproduced, and give voice to those who experience
oppression at the intersections of sex, race, and class, among other
things.]{.underline}23 FLT is [oriented toward making
change]{.underline}; it [leans toward inclusivity and collective
solutions]{.underline}. Additionally, FLT questions the existence of a
formal public/private divide and is open to state involvement to address
societal wrongs.24 [Given the frequency and scope of gun violence in
women\'s lives, the hostile resistance in many corners to any type of
gun regulation, and the growing insistence on firearm ownership as a
means of public safety, a feminist analysis of the Second Amendment
right is essential to comprehending what is at stake in this highly
charged debate.]{.underline} SJF, a recently articulated strand of
feminist legal theory, is particularly apt in this context because it
reaffirms feminist ideals of focusing on under-served communities. The
term \"[social justice feminism\" emerged from feminist legal advocates
in response to calls from women of color and other marginalized women
seeking greater progress on issues affecting them, particularly
violence.]{.underline}25 SJF builds upon the various waves of feminism,
reinforcing its original mission and expanding its reach. Specifically,
SJF \"strives to uncover and dismantle \[social and political structures
that support patriarchy\], 26 while \"recognizing and addressing
multiple oppressions.\"27 Martha Chamallas has suggested that SJF is
\"[a new take on intersectionality theory and intersectional
feminism.\"28 Given its genesis among practitioners, SJF embodies three
core methodologies that \"attempt to reveal features of a legal issue
that more traditional methods tend to overlook or
suppress:\"]{.underline} 2 9 One method, [looking to history to
understand subordinating structures, seeks to acquire more knowledge
with which to understand and then dismantle the bases of societal
institutions that perpetuate hierarchies and inequities.]{.underline}
Another method, examining the inter-relationships between interlocking
oppressions, asks how issues of gender, race, class, and other
categories of identity and experiences work together to create social
injustice. [A third method, ensuring that principles of dismantling
interlocking oppressions inform solutions, keeps the focus on bottom-up
strategies in fashioning remedies.]{.underline} 30 Accordingly, SJF
focuses on historical context, structural inequities, intersecting
oppressions, and underserved populations. In so doing, SJF methods
reveal issues that liberal feminism might fail to recognize as having
significant gender implications. 3 SJF\'s historical method emphasizes
examining the past in order to \"understand subordinating structures\"
to identify the roots of structural inequalities in order to dismantle
them.32 In this regard, SJF follows in the footsteps of feminist and
critical race theory in seeking to \"uncover\[\] lost histor\[y\] . . .
\[and\] re-examin\[e\] how history has been told and understood.\"33
Recognizing that history is constructed, typically by those in power**[,
SJF seeks to elevate the experiences of those left on the margins to
uncover how traditional historical narratives mask and perpetuate
subordination.]{.underline}** 34 Such a perspective is especially
necessary in this context given the highly contested nature of the
historical accounts articulated in Heller and McDonald3,5 upon which the
Court heavily relied. Accordingly, **[the parts that follow examine the
Second Amendment\'s history with an eye toward exposing the context
within which it emerged, a setting that established the foundation for a
race- and gender-based social hierarchy.]{.underline}**

### AT: Human Rights Links

#### Violence against women is widely regarded as a human rights abuse -- framing it as such is key to understanding the responsibility the state has to solve it

**OHCHR no date --** (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights, United Nations Human Rights, "Violence against women,"
<https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WRGS/Pages/VAW.aspx>) // S.Y.

The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women defines
"violence against women" as "any act of gender-based violence that
results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological
harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or
arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private
life."

[It has taken decades of struggle by the women's rights movement to
persuade the international community to view gender-based violence
against women as a human rights concern and not just as a private
matter]{.underline} in which the State should not interfere. In 1992,
the CEDAW Committee in its General Recommendation No. 19, asserted that
[violence against women is a form of discrimination, directed towards a
woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately.
This violence seriously inhibits women's ability to enjoy rights and
freedoms on a basis of equality with men.]{.underline} In December 1993,
the [Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women,
recognized that **violence against women violates women\'s rights and
fundamental freedoms** and called on states and the international
community to work toward the eradication of violence against
women.]{.underline} The same year, [the Vienna Declaration and Programme
of Action recognized that **the elimination of violence against women in
public and private life is a human rights obligation.**]{.underline} The
then Commission on Human Rights condemned gender-based violence for the
first time in 1994 and the same year appointed a Special Rapporteur on
violence against women, its causes and consequences. [The 1995 UN World
Conference on Women held in Beijing reaffirmed the conclusions of the
Vienna Conference, listing violence against women as one of the critical
areas of concern. In 2017, the CEDAW Committee,]{.underline} marking
25th anniversary of its General Recommendation No. 19, [further
elaborated international standards on gender-based violence against
women in its General Recommendation No. 35]{.underline}. In General
Recommendation No. 35, [the CEDAW Committee recognized that the
**prohibition of gender-based violence against women** has **evolved
into a principle of** customary **international law**, binding all
States.]{.underline}

[Framing gender-based violence against women as a human rights violation
implies an important conceptual shift. It means recognizing that women
are not exposed to violence by accident]{.underline}, or because of an
in-born vulnerability. Instead, [violence is the result of structural,
deep-rooted discrimination which the state has an obligation to address.
Preventing and addressing gender-based violence against women is
therefore not a charitable act. It is a legal and moral obligation
requiring legislative, administrative and institutional measures and
reforms]{.underline} and the eradication of gender stereotypes which
condone or perpetuate gender-based violence against women and underpin
the structural inequality of women with men.

[The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and the
CEDAW General Recommendation No. 35 provide for the concept of due
diligence obligation of States]{.underline}. Under this obligation,
[States have a duty to take positive action to prevent and protect women
from violence, punish perpetrators]{.underline} of violent acts [and
compensate victims]{.underline} of violence. The principle of [due
diligence]{.underline} is crucial as it [provides the missing link
between human rights obligations and acts of private
persons]{.underline}.

Considerable progress has been made in many countries of the world.
Comprehensive legal frameworks and specific institutions and policies
have been put in place to promote women's rights, prevent and protect
women from violence. There is growing awareness of the nature and impact
of violence against women around the world. Innovative and promising
practices are reported every year to the General Assembly, the Human
Rights Council and the Commission on the Status of Women, including in
the areas of investigations, prosecution and provision of services.

Yet, the figures on prevalence of violence against women are alarming.
According to data by the World Health Organization, one third of women
globally experience violence at least once in their lifetime. There are
still obstacles to women's access to justice, resulting into widespread
impunity for violence. Considerable efforts are still required to
promote women's and girls' autonomy and choice and to ensure the
realization of the right of women and girls to a life free from violence

### AT: Necropolitics

#### Gendered violence operates as an implicit mechanism of necropolitics 

**Wright 11** (Melissa W. Wright, Professor of Women\'s, Gender, and
Sexuality Studies and Geography, "Necropolitics, Narcopolitics, and
Femicide: Gendered Violence on the Mexico-U.S. Border", Vol. 36, No. 3
(March 2011), pp. 707-731,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/657496)//kb

With this concept of necropolitics in mind, I examine how the wars over
the political meaning of death in relation both to [femicide
and]{.underline} to the events called [drug violence unfold through a
gendering of space, of violence, and of subjectivity]{.underline}. My
objective is twofold: first, to demonstrate how the antifemicide
movement illustrates the stakes for a democratic Mexican state and its
citizens while governing elites argue that the violence devastating
Ciudad Jua´rez is a positive outcome of the government's war against
organized crime; and second, to show how [a politics of gender is
central to]{.underline} this kind of [necropolitics]{.underline}. I am
not the first feminist theorist to point out that [gender politics are
foundational not only to the formation of the liberal democratic
institutions that emerged out of the destruction]{.underline}. Wright of
absolutist states but also to the organization of states as the
legitimate arbiters of violence (Landes 1988; Melzer and Rabine 1992;
McMillan 2009). For instance, as historian Joan Landes has written, "[a
pervasive gendering of the public sphere" operates as a "mechanism of
violence" for defining and controlling the modern liberal subject around
the exclusion of "the feminine" from the public sphere of politics,
economy, and culture]{.underline} (1988, 2). [Gender, in other words, is
central to the violent dynamics linking the production of states to the
reproduction of their subjects. As the proliferation of gendered
violence around the world indicates, this kind of violence is
constitutive of necropolitics: the politics of death and the politics of
gender go hand in hand]{.underline} (United Nations 2006). As the
antifemicide movement clearly demonstrates, however, the neglect of
gender so prevalent in discussions such as Mbembe's limits the political
possibilities for subverting the relations of power reproduced through
gendered necropolitics as people encounter the violence of gender in
their daily lives (Ahmetbeyzade 2008).2

### AT: Essentialism

#### We've link turned this- small arms are a crucial internal to maintaining gender stereotypes and hierarchies.

**Farr 02**

**(Vanessa A. Farr, African Women's Anti-War Coalition, A Gendered

It is not, however, the only reason. Although, as we have seen, the
relationship between the violation of women's rights and the abuse of
weapons is alluded to in Declarations, Protocols, Plans of Action and
[other such attempts to manage SALW, the majority of these
documents]{.underline} mention the impact of gun proliferation on women
in such a way that they [do little to challenge existing gender
ideologies about "women as victims" and "men as
perpetrators."]{.underline} [Such an unreflective endorsement of gender
stereotypes offers no space in which to analyze the real complexities of
gender roles in wartime, including the fact that women are frequently
very active in periods of struggle, as fighters and supporters, and that
war sometimes allows women to take on roles that might not be open to
them in times of peace.]{.underline} [These roles may include women's
participation in the proliferation and normalization of guns, either
because they carry and use light weapons, or because they participate in
liberation struggles by smuggling arms or hiding weapons and/or their
bearers.]{.underline} As feminist analysts maintain, **[one of the most
egregious effects of gender stereotyping is to make invisible women's
complex participation in social events and political
processes.]{.underline}** While feminist activists in non-conflict
situations have made some progress in correcting women's exclusion from
influential public arenas by contending gender ideologies that identify
women with the domestic arena alone, it has proven much more difficult
to extend the same right to women who are caught up in violent
conflicts. In a world where poverty and dispossession are on the rise,
armed violence is increasingly the result of contestations of identity.
[It is essential]{.underline}, then, [to understand how **gender
identities are mobilized in support of the machinery of
war**]{.underline}. In assessing this issue, feminist theorists have
proved that [ideas about women and femininity form an essential part of
the process of constructing a male identity that is deemed appropriate
for a warring society]{.underline}. Cynthia Enloe notes that the
manipulation of notions of gender-appropriate behavior is a central
component of ethnic nationalism (Enloe, 1998), and holds that [the
"militarization of women has been crucial for the militarization of
governments and of international relations. The militarization of women
has been necessary for the militarization of men"]{.underline} (Enloe,
2000 p. 3). Yet while significant attention has been paid to the ways in
which men and ideas about masculinity are mobilized as part of the war
machine -and this attention has not always been critical- it is only in
recent years that we have begun to understand that women, and
deeply-held beliefs about femininity, are also both militarized and
mobilized in support of the ideology of war (Cock, 1991; Goldstein,
2001). While recognizing a pattern in the ways in which societies
manipulate gender ideologies, feminist scholars have also worked to
nuance our understanding of how women find ways to be active in
determining their roles and the identities they take on to fulfill these
roles during the build-up to war, in wartime, and afterwards. They have
pointed out that even in the duress of conflict, women's identities are
strategic and shifting (Cockburn, 2001). [Arguing against the
predominant stereotypes of women as innately peaceful and men as
inevitably warlike]{.underline} (Fukuyama, 1998; Goldstein, 2001),
[feminists have urged that we recognize the complexity of gender
ideologies and the multiple roles they play in drawing different social
actors into war.]{.underline} [In peacetime, as in wartime, women
display a wide variety of responses to organized and/or state-sanctioned
forms of violence]{.underline}. There is a long and much-celebrated
history of feminist pacifism (Schreiner, 1911), and some women, as peace
activists, play essential roles in maintaining social connections, build
coalitions across communities divided by violence, and therefore are
ideally positioned to play important roles in rehabilitation,
reconciliation, reintegration support and peacebuilding roles in the
aftermath. It is important to remember, however, that their power is
somewhat tempered by the fact that their influence will only be felt if
adequate provision is made to include women in peace negotiations and
reconstruction planning (Anderlini, 2000; Farr 2000). At the same time,
however, that women are celebrated as the peacemakers -whether or not
they find opportunities to do any meaningful peacebuilding work- there
are also many examples of women embracing "revolution with hope and war
with enthusiasm" (Hill, 2001 p. 21). Even if they do not enlist as
soldiers, women can, and do, participate in conflict through supporting
and maintaining guerrilla forces. They supply the essentials of war:
information, food, clothing and shelter. They nurse soldiers back to
health. [Women, then, are active in times of conflict in a variety of
ways, whether in building peace or in supporting violence. Yet their
contributions are all too frequently overlooked after conflict has come
to an end.]{.underline} As Linda Grant De Pauw writes: "Women have
always and everywhere been inextricably involved in war \[but\] hidden
from history\....During wars, women are ubiquitous and highly visible;
when wars are over and the songs are sung, women disappear" (De Pauw,
1998 p. XIII). While many feminists have remarked that women's
peacebuilding activities receive too little recognition in the period of
reconstruction (Anderlini, 2000; Enloe, 2000), it is also true that
women who were active participants in the struggle are not always
allowed to participate, as leaders, in the development of transition and
reconstruction processes. Ultimately, [their support is only recognized
in relation to what is expected from their kinship to male soldiers:
they are acknowledged, but as mothers, sisters, wives or
daughters.]{.underline} However varied their levels of involvement in
the business of war, they remain at the margins of political, economic,
and social power, and their voices and experiences tend to disappear
when peace processes begin (Goldblatt and Meintjes, 1996). In the end,
women's contributions are overlooked in the country emerging from war;
and because of this, their presence is reduced to a single line in the
documents which spring up to counter the effects of armed conflict. In
this way, [the complexity of their experiences is boiled down to a
single ideology that women are more vulnerable than men, and thus
deserving of a kind of protection and security that is decided by
men.]{.underline}

#### Their essentialism argument misreads our criticism- gender is a social construction which is enforced contingently

In order to understand feminist work in ir, it is important to note that
**[gender is not the equivalent of membership in biological sex
classes.]{.underline}** Instead, **[gender is a system of symbolic
meaning that creates social hierarchies based on perceived associations
with masculine and feminine characteristics.]{.underline}** As Lauren
Wilcox explains, **["gender symbolism describes the way in which
masculine/feminine are assigned to various dichotomies that organize
Western thought" where "both men and women tend to place a higher value
on the term which is associated with masculinity."23 Gendered social
hierarchy, then, is at once a social construction and a "structural
feature of social and political life" that "profoundly shapes our place
in, and view of, the world."]{.underline}**24¶ **[This is not to say
that all people, or even all women, experience gender in the same
ways]{.underline}**. While genders are lived by people throughout the
world, **["it would be unrepresentative to characterize a \'gendered
experience\' as if there were something measurable that all men or all
women shared in life experience.]{.underline}**"25 Each person lives
gender in a different culture, body, language, and identity. Therefore,
**[there is not one gendered experience of global politics, but
many.]{.underline}** By extension, there is not one gender-based
perspective on ir or international security, but many. **[Still, as a
structural feature of social and political life, gender is "a set of
discourses that represent, construct, change, and enforce social
meaning."26 Feminism, then, "is neither just about women, nor the
addition of women to male-stream constructions; it is about transforming
ways of being and knowing" as gendered discourses are understood and
transformed]{.underline}**.27

### AT: Cap

#### Being 'against the system' isn't enough- their anti-capitalist resistance is imbued with gendered hierarchies

[Gendered hierarchies and cultural scripts are not a side issue for
movements that]{.underline} aim to [contest]{.underline} the
g[lobalization of capitalism]{.underline}. Materialist feminists have
highlighted how capitalism has relied upon concealed, underpaid or
unpaid female labour (e.g. Eisenstein 1979; Barrett 1980; Fuentes and
Ehren- reich 1983). As Rosemary Hennessy (2000: 6) puts it, '[women
provide most of the world's socially necessary labor -- that is, labor
that is necessary to col- lective survival -- but much of it is rendered
invisible, both in and outside the value system of commodity
exchange]{.underline}'. Materialist analyses have also highlighted the
relationship between heteronormative and capitalist social relations.
Leslie Feinberg (1997: 231, see also Hennessy 1996), for example,
theorizes the oppression of transgender people under capitalism through
a Marxist analysis of how an ideology of binary gender became hegemonic
with 'the rise of private property, the male-dominated family and class
divisions'.¶ Moreover, the power-laden performances through which gender
is produced are intricately bound up with cultural scripts deployed in
the imposition of capitalist relations across the world. J. K.
Gibson-Graham (1996: 120--47), for instance, draws a parallel of
globalization's 'tightly scripted narrative of differential power' that
celebrates 'the inevitability of capitalist penetration' in every corner
of the world and the script that normalizes and naturalizes the rape of
female bodies (1996: 120--1). Lara Coleman (2007) has explored how the
violent imposition of neoliberal development in Colombia has mobi- lized
gendered imaginative geographies, through which spaces targeted for
'civilizing' interventions are marked out in terms of sub-ordinate
gender identities counterposed to the identity of an ideal citizen cast
in terms of a hegemonic, bourgeois-rational masculinity. Similarly,
Penny [Griffin (2007) has highlighted the way in which dominant forms of
heterosexual masculinity mark out the norms of successful human
behaviour reproduced in the neoliberal discourse of the World Bank**.**¶
**The reiteration of gendered cultural scripts within
(anti-)globalization politics does not only shore up capitalism's
unequal effects on women**]{.underline} (cf. Sullivan 2005: 9**[). It
also bolsters other effects of gender-based oppression on women,
transgender people and men with non-hegemonic gender
performances]{.underline}**. Moreover, [this reiteration of
hierarchically ordered gender identities should be understood as
reinforcing capitalist relations at a much deeper level, in that it
restates the cultural scripts that capital deploys to normalize its
interventions and policy 'solutions]{.underline}'.¶ There is a circular
element to this too. **[Who is visible and who can speak within
(anti-)globalization politics]{.underline}**, and which bodies are
privileged or excluded**[, derives from the gendered performance of
'resistance'.]{.underline}** Cultural texts assign roles defining, for
example, who is able to speak with authority and **[who is confined to a
walk-on appearance as a 'movement housewife]{.underline}**' (Roth 2001).
[This in turn forecloses the possibilities for contestation and
re-signification within spaces of 'resistance', reinforcing the tendency
to re-iterate those cultural scripts that enhance the status
quo.]{.underline}

### Feminist Movements Framing

#### Feminist networks inspire global shifts in gender equality

**Alvarez 2000**(Sonia E. Alvarez, "Translating the Global Effects of
Transnational Organizing on Local Feminist Discourses and Practices in
Latin America", Meridians, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Autumn, 2000), pp. 29-67, Duke
University Press, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40338427)//kb

**[The heightened participation of women\'s rights advocates in
international policy arenas is now]{.underline}** fairly well documented
and the efficacy of global feminisms in **[promoting changes in
gender-related policy at the international and national
levels]{.underline}** has been subjected to considerable scrutiny.3 But
the literature has largely ignored the flip side of the much-celebrated
\"globalization of feminism\"- the impact \"back home\" of local
activists\' involvement in international networks and policy arenas,
which Elisabeth Friedman (1999) has dubbed the effects of
\"transnationalism reversed.\"4 We now have considerable evidence that
**[feminist networking and ad-vocacy on a global scale have enabled
local women\'s rights advocates to \" \'leapfrog\' past the boundaries
of state sovereignty to propose visions of women\'s liberation that
national governments might not countenance]{.underline}**\" (Baden and
Goetz 1997, 45). It also arguably has sometimes enhanced their leverage
vis-a-vis recalcitrant local policy-makers (Keck and Sikkink 1998a; Htun
1998). But few studies have explored the critical question of how
feminist activists\' engagement with policy advocacy on a suprana-
tional plane translates locally in terms of movement dynamics,
discourses, and practices. [By analyzing some of the local impacts of a
wide array of transborder activities undertaken by Latin American
feminists over the past two decades]{.underline}, I want to draw
attention to three oft-neglected dimen- sions of the
transnationalization of local feminist discourses and practices. The
local and transnational forces shaping feminist movement dynamics are,
of course, mutually constitutive and therefore difficult to disen-
tangle analytically. In the sense used here, [transnationalization
refers to local movement actors\' deployment of discursive frames and
organiza- tional and political practices that are inspired,
(re)affirmed, or reinforced -though not necessarily caused- by their
engagement with other actors beyond national borders through a wide
range of transnational contacts, discussions, transactions, and
networks, both virtual and \"real.\"]{.underline}

#### Governmental solidarity alters local power dynamics 

**Alvarez 2000**(Sonia E. Alvarez, "Translating the Global Effects of
Transnational Organizing on Local Feminist Discourses and Practices in
Latin America", Meridians, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Autumn, 2000), pp. 29-67, Duke
University Press, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40338427)//kb

I will suggest that [local movement actors pursue transnational linkages
with their counterparts beyond the boundaries of the
nation-state]{.underline} for (at least) two distinct reasons. First,
local movement **[actors use transnational contacts as a means to
(re)construct or reaffirm subaltern or politically marginalized
identities and to establish personal and strategic bonds of solidarity
with others who share locally stigmatized values]{.underline}** (for
example, feminist ideals) or identities (for example, as Afro-Latin
Americans or as lesbians). Second, activists also organize across
borders in an effort to ex- pand formal rights or affect public policy,
seeking to enhance their local political leverage via what Margaret Keck
and Kathryn Sikkink (1998a, 12-13) call [the \"boomerang
pattern\"]{.underline} of influence. By this [means, trans- national
coalitions of nongovernmental, governmental, and intergovern- mental
actors exert pressure on more powerful states]{.underline} and on igos
[to in turn bring pressure to bear on a particular government that
violates rights or resists a desired policy change]{.underline}.7 These
two transnational activist logics, of course, are seldom entirely
TRANSLATING THE GLOBAL 31 terms separable in actual movement practices.
In fact, they often operate within the same governmental,
intergovernmental, or movement spaces and can be mutually reinforcing.
For example, as Ann Marie Clark, Elisabeth Fried- man and Kathryn
Hochstetler rightly note, \"beyond efforts to influence official
positions \[at UN World Conferences\], a separate and often com-
plementary ngo strategy is networking\" or engaging in informal ngo-
to-NGO strategic discussions (1998, 19). Similarly, as I will explore
below, the Latin American advocacy coalition established in the early
1990s to in- fluence the regional preparatory process for Beijing was
built upon many years of previous intraregional [identity-solidarity
exchanges among feminists-especially among those who increasingly became
involved in national gender policy matters]{.underline} over the course
of the 1980s. Finally, I will maintain that these distinctive
transnational activist logics none- the less [can have]{.underline}
different [effects on local movement organizational dynamics and power
relations]{.underline} and can sometimes clash in local movement arenas.
Whereas the existing literature typically lumps all cross-border
organizing efforts under a single analytical rubric (for instance,
\"global civil society\" or transnational so- cial movements), I want to
suggest that different modalities of transbor- der activism not only can
have differential impacts on promoting desired policy changes, but also
can have distinct political consequences for activ- ist discourses and
practices and for intramovement power relations on the home front.8 In
conclusion, I will argue that while the interplay of these two
**[transnational activist logics has brought numerous benefits to local
movements]{.underline}**, the predominance of iGO-advocacy activities
among grow- ing sectors of Latin American feminist movements in recent
years has had more ambiguous and sometimes contradictory local
consequences.

#### The aff's methodology uses the state as a vehicle to interject change 

**Phillips and Cole 09**(Lynne Phillips and Sally Cole, "Feminist Flows,
Feminist Fault Lines: Women's Machineries and Women's Movements in Latin
America", The University of Chicago Press, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Autumn 2009),
pp. 185-211, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/599260)//kb

[Concepts of networks]{.underline}, alliances and coalitions [are more
helpful in an analysis of feminist politics than those of identity or
difference because they foreground the practice of recognizing
differences and commonalities simultaneously.]{.underline} They point up
the social and political work that is done when engaging across
difference. They are suggestive of the contingency and of the potential
for both fragility and resilience of the grouping of those supporting a
political project, especially over time and space. ---Sylvia Walby
(2002, 547--48) Our research is an example of the kind of empirical
analysis Sylvia Walby has argued is needed in order to understand the
"actual nature of specific international feminist political relations"
(2002, 550; emphasis added) rather than assuming an imperial relation.
Walby reminds us that [globalization,]{.underline} beyond being an
economic process involving the development of global financial and
capital markets, [is a political process that "has involved the
restructuring of the political environmen]{.underline}t, re-positioning
the nation-state in a web of trans-national networks and institutions"
(551). I[n this process new political opportunities have emerged that
feminists have been adept at recognizing, taking up new
spaces]{.underline} and "levers" (Ferree 2006, 11) [to promote their
demands for gender equality]{.underline} and broader social change. In
this article we argue that [feminists' willingness to integrate
themselves into state democratic machineries and mixed alternative
social movements represents a strategic decision to change the
repertoire and form of feminism]{.underline}---not the cooptation or
abeyance of feminism. Given the fluidity of globalization and the
transnational orientation of feminism today, we argue that **[this is
not a matter of ignoring the difference between reformist and
transformative politics]{.underline}** (Vargas 2003) **[but rather of
recognizing a strategic politics that engages with new]{.underline}**
(and always changing) **[opportunities for broadening translations of
feminism for social change.]{.underline}** Many of those practicing
feminist politics have found a way of working across difference while
utilizing the discourse of human rights. As globalization has
restructured gendered political opportunities and resources in complex
ways, **[human rights discourses "now take a hybridized rather than a
purely Western form]{.underline}**" (Walby 2002, 535; cf. Mohanty 1991;
Ong 2006). This is why it is important not to interpret feminist
politics outside their contexts, assuming, for example, that a human
rights discourse reflects a turn to individualist or liberal feminism.
Rather, as Walby concludes, "[the notion that women's rights are human
rights]{.underline} [is]{.underline} an addition to the political
repertoire of feminists" (2002, 549; emphasis added), [a repertoire that
needs to be located and understood in context.]{.underline} This new
political environment requires us to look at the translations of
feminism as contingent on the kinds of alliances being built at any
given time. [Our methodology recognizes that emergent global
institutions]{.underline} and forums such as the World Social Forum and
the Continental Social Alliance against Free Trade [present new spaces
for the development of feminist ideas, practice, and
alliances]{.underline}, alliances that feminists are skillfully using to
pressure national governments. In this article we argue that [Latin
American feminists' active engagement with state agencies]{.underline},
advisory councils, and ministries (i.e., machineries) [can be understood
as a strategic politics of presence---of surveillance of the state
agenda and actions for implementing gender equality.]{.underline} These
intermediate institutions and spaces mediate feminist practice and are
essential to understand in Latin America, where **[the state remains a
critical site for feminist politics]{.underline}**. Our research
illustrates how feminists are forming political alignments at a range of
levels in which engaging with states represents one node in a wider
network of relevant political and cultural forums. New arenas of
"insurgent citizenship" (Holston 2008) based, for example, on the
solidarity economy (economia solida´ ria) or environmental movements are
other spaces in which feminists localize utopian and alternative visions
for the future.6 In our study, the popular education work of REMTE and
its allies, CF8 and MUROCSE, provide ethnographic examples of how
feminism is mobilizing and allying with these emergent arenas in the
Latin American case. [The flows of feminism in Latin America, then, must
be understood within this fluid context of globalization and feminist
politics.]{.underline}
