[The killing a month ago of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical
of Riyadh, under the most peculiar of circumstances is the latest in a
litany of acrimonious moves Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has
made since 2015]{.underline}. Such [actions have seemingly increased
after Crown Prince Mohammed consolidated power by]{.underline}
dramatically [unseating his uncle as crown prince]{.underline} and
imprisoning his rivals in the Riyadh Ritz Carlton for months in 2017.
**[As Riyadh has flexed its muscles in ways that appear to complicate
U.S. interests in the region, Washington has seemingly acquiesced to, or
at times seemed to welcome, Saudi adventurism]{.underline}**, including
a devastating military campaign abroad supported by limited U.S.
military assistance. **[To many, the United States appears beholden to
the kingdom]{.underline}**. **[In actuality, Riyadh needs Washington
more than Washington needs Riyadh, and the missteps in Saudi
decisionmaking have caused significant damage to the kingdom\'s
reputation]{.underline}**, **[reinforcing its dependence on
America.]{.underline}** The United States has an opportunity to exert
its influence to shape Saudi behavior, perhaps more than ever before.
[Saudi Arabia has long relied on the United States as its primary
security guarantor]{.underline}. **[Today, the Middle Eastern nation
benefits from U.S. training, arms, intelligence cooperation and, up
until recently, refueling efforts for the Saudi-led air war in
Yemen.]{.underline}** Yet, [despite the Saudi reliance on the United
States in key areas pertaining to political and military affairs,
America has been reluctant to press the Kingdom\'s decisionmakers to
change their behavior.]{.underline} Domestically, [many have long
questioned whether the breadth and depth of the ties between the two
countries serve U.S. interests]{.underline}, [and the relationship has
long been a point of contention in American foreign policy
circles.]{.underline} Although the United States plays a
disproportionate role in the Middle Eastern nation\'s security, it
doesn\'t always use this to enforce its values and interests, or see
this as a point of leverage. Recent [developments heightened
long-simmering tensions between Riyadh and Washington. Criticism of the
Kingdom\'s foreign policy has become more pronounced since the beginning
of the war in Yemen in 2015]{.underline} and the Gulf crisis two years
later that pit Saudi Arabia and its allies against Qatar. **[While there
is seemingly a push to "punish" Riyadh by imposing sanctions and halting
support for the Yemen war, there does not appear to be a fundamental
shift taking place in U.S. policy]{.underline}**. While the
administration is taking some steps to placate critics and Riyadh is
reportedly holding officials accountable for Khashoggi\'s murder inside
the Saudi consulate, history suggests that this is unlikely to lead to a
significant departure from the status quo. **[U.S.-Saudi relations were
founded on two core interests that have been the hallmark of the
partnership since its inception in 1945---security and
oil]{.underline}**. [**Security has played an outsize role in the
bilateral ties, particularly as political tensions have historically
produced significant strain. Low points in the broader relationship
include the 1973 oil embargo and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.** Despite
these fractious issues, the ties between Riyadh and Washington have
endured. This durability reflects the reasons behind the cooperation: A
convergence of needs and interests that remain today]{.underline}: [Oil
in return for security]{.underline}. But [these]{.underline} driving
[interests may be changing as the United States pursues renewable energy
in a bid to become less dependent on petro states]{.underline} and as
Saudi Arabia aspires to "go it alone" to ensure its security and that of
its immediate neighbors. These opposing goals have placed pressure on
the relationship without derailing it. [Since Crown Prince Mohammed
consolidated power, however, divergent Saudi and U.S. interests and
worldviews have come to the forefront. Initially, many Americans praised
the prince as a reformer, bringing the kingdom into the 21st
century]{.underline}. But [it soon became clear that the reforms were
more limited than many had hoped]{.underline} and that the efforts were
taking place against the backdrop of problematic policies at home and
abroad. [Several developments have garnered more scrutiny of Saudi
policies: The manner in which the prince has silenced those he views as
his opponents---including Khashogg]{.underline}i---[coupled with
international incidents]{.underline}, chiefly the ongoing devastating
Saudi-led efforts in the war in Yemen, creating the world\'s worst
humanitarian crisis, and the internecine rift among the Arab Gulf
states. Both the Obama and Trump administrations watched as the
kingdom\'s policies became more assertive, leading to the widely held
assumption that America can\'t change the Saudi calculus. But this is
far from the truth. As the Saudis\' chief political and military partner
and the undisputed security guarantor in the Middle East, the United
States has considerable influence it can wield over Saudi
decisionmaking. It has thus far gone virtually unused. In reality, the
United States may have more leverage over Saudi Arabia today than at any
other time except during the 1991 Gulf War. **[Trump\'s ascension to the
U.S. presidency helped alleviate some of Saudi Arabia\'s concerns that
stemmed from President Obama\'s Middle East policies and,
consequently]{.underline}**, **[afforded the United States more
influence over the kingdom]{.underline}**. [The Saudis had grown
distrustful of U.S. commitment to the region due to President Obama\'s
plans to pivot to Asia and his administration\'s response to the Arab
Spring and pursuit of a nuclear deal with Tehran]{.underline}. But
President Trump made Riyadh the destination of his first foreign trip in
office and pledged to support the kingdom while harshly criticizing its
archenemy, Iran, and withdrawing from the nuclear deal this past May.
A**[t the same time, Saudi Arabia has become more reliant on the United
States than when President Obama was in office]{.underline}**.
Riy**[adh\'s contentious policies---like the war in Yemen and the rift
with its neighbors---have constrained its options and inadvertently
reinforced Saudi Arabia\'s need for U.S. military and political
support]{.underline}**, **[including security cooperation and
intelligence sharing]{.underline}**. Prince [Mohammed\'s legacy and
perhaps even power is presently tied to two initiatives:]{.underline}
[The Yemen war and Vision 2030---an ambitious program of social and
economic reforms that Riyadh plans to institute to diversify its
economy]{.underline}. Neither objective is apparently proceeding as the
crown prince had hoped. And **[to succeed, they will likely require
continued U.S. support. Until recently, President Trump was not inclined
to use these developments as leverage. Instead, he stood by the crown

under attack in Congress and by international rights groups. **[Some

###    AT: Leverage

#### Poking the bear with Saudi Arabia has economic, and political consequences -- it could harm domestic jobs, and oil prices

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - **[The United States and Saudi Arabia have had a
mutually dependent relationship for seven decades based on a central
bargain: the kingdom would pump oil and the superpower would provide
security. The interests that bind,]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
sometimes **[divide]{.underline}**, [the two range from the price of oil
and containing Iran, to counter-terrorism, the wars in Syria and
Yemen]{.underline}, Saudi investment in the United States and efforts to
resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [Relations have been strained
by the Oct. 2 disappearance of Saudi journalist and Washington Post
contributor Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline} when he visited the Saudi
consulate in Istanbul[. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body
removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that but, according to published
reports, may be considering describing the incident as an attempted
rendition gone wrong.]{.underline} Below are descriptions of the
leverage each side has and the risks of exercising it. OIL **[As the
world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia has some ability to flood the
market to depress oil prices or to curb supply and raise them.
The]{.underline}** **[kingdom]{.underline}** generally **[seeks a sweet
spot to maximize current oil revenues without endangering future
earnings, which could happen if prices rose so high that they chilled
demand or encouraged development of alternatives. Saudi Arabia needs oil
revenue to fund state expenses and its Public Investment
Fund]{.underline}**, a sovereign wealth fund slated to play a leading
role in its drive to develop non-oil industries. On Sunday, **[the Saudi
Press Agency]{.underline}** (SPA) **[quoted an unnamed Saudi official
making a veiled threat to respond to pressure by tinkering with oil
supplies. With the boom in production of U.S. shale oil, the United
States is less dependent on imported oil.]{.underline}** However, **[a
Saudi decision to shrink global oil supplies and raise prices could
hurt]{.underline}** U.S. President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** **[by
slowing economic growth and denting his 2020 re-election prospects. It
could also undercut the U.S. effort to shrink Iran's oil
revenues]{.underline}**, **[part of a wider U.S. strategy of forcing
Tehran to curb its nuclear and missile programs]{.underline}** **[as
well as its support for proxies in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and
Iraq]{.underline}**. **[High oil prices would raise Iran's revenues just
as Washington wants to reduce them.]{.underline}** Trump called Saudi
King Salman on Sept. 29 to discuss efforts to maintain supplies to
ensure oil market stability and global economic growth, Saudi state news
agency SPA reported. ARMS SALES **[Trump has sent mixed signals on
whether he wishes to punish Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's
disappearan]{.underline}**ce. **[While Trump]{.underline}** on Saturday
**[promised "severe punishment" for Saudi Arabia if Khashoggi was
killed]{.underline}** in the consulate**[, he has stressed his
reluctance to halt U.S. arms sales]{.underline}**, **[saying this would
cost U.S. jobs and benefit Russian and Chinese companies.]{.underline}**
**[Arms expert William Hartung]{.underline}** of the Center for
International Policy, a U.S. research and advocacy group, **[argued the
installed base of U.S. aircraft and other military systems in Saudi
Arabia made it unlikely]{.underline}** **[Russia or China could supplant
U.S. dealers.]{.underline}** The U.S. Congress could act on its own to
stop arms sales. "I'm going to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia,"
Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News, adding in a separate interview with
Fox News Radio, "I would suspend arms sales as long as he (Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman) is in charge." However, Congress is on
recess until Nov. 13 and lawmakers' outrage could wane before they
return. YEMEN/IRAN **[U.S. lawmakers have grown uneasy with a Saudi-led
coalition's war in Yemen because of civilian casualties. The Khashoggi
case could accentuate calls in Congress to limit U.S. support for the
coalition. The U.S. military refuels jets for the coalition carrying out
strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and also engages in
limited intelligence sharing. A small number of U.S. special forces are
on the Saudi border with Yemen to help the kingdom defend against
missiles fired by the Houthis into Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. Yemen is
just one theater where Sunni Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia are vying
for regional supremacy with Shi'ite Iran. **[The United States and Saudi
Arabia both wish to contain Iran, and Washington depends on Riyadh to
serve as a bulwark against Iranian influence, notably in Syria and
Lebanon.]{.underline}**

###    Tornado alt cause

####  The RSAF will still have British Tornado aircraft to use

**1AC Riedel 18** (Bruce Riedel is a Senior Fellow of Foreign Policy at
the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence and Center for
Middle East Policy, and he is the Director of the Intelligence Project.
Published 10/10/2018, Accessed 7/8/2019 "After Khashoggi, US arms sales
to the Saudis are essential leverage" Brookings,

\|Trip\|

Eighteen months ago, Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and said he had
concluded \$110 billion dollars in arms sales with the kingdom. It was
fake news then and it's still fake news today. The Saudis have not
concluded a single major arms deal with Washington on Trump's watch.
Nonetheless, the U.S. arms relationship with the kingdom is the most
important leverage Washington has as it contemplates reacting to the
alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi. In June 2017, after the president's
visit to Riyadh---his first official foreign travel---we published a
Brookings blog post detailing that his claims to have sold \$110 billion
in weapons were spurious. Other media outlets subsequently came to the
same conclusion. When Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman visited the
White House this year, the president indirectly confirmed that non-deal
by chiding the prince for spending only "peanuts" on arms from America.
The Saudis have continued to buy spare parts, munitions, and technical
support for the enormous amount of American equipment they have bought
from previous administrations. [[The]{.mark} Royal Saudi Air Force
([RSAF) is entirely dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} on American and
[[British support for its]{.underline}]{.mark} air fleet of F15 fighter
jets, Apache helicopters, and [[Tornado aircraft]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If either Washington or London halts the flow of logistics, the RSAF
will be grounded. The Saudi army and the Saudi Arabian National Guard
are similarly dependent on foreigners (the Saudi Arabian National Guard
is heavily dependent on Canada). The same is also true for the Saudis
allies like Bahrain.

##   HR ADV

#### War is gonna get won by Saudis

Knights 18 (Michael Knights, ME affairs specialist, "Is the Yemen War
Really Deadlocked? Think Again," The Washington Institute, 9/2018,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/is-the-yemen-war-really-deadlocked-think-again>)

[It has become a cliche to say tha]{.underline}t the war in [Yemen has
reached a point of]{.underline} military d[eadlock.]{.underline} Rebel
forces led by the Houthi clan control the capital Sanaa and the
country's largest port Hodeidah, and they have a proven track record of
slowing down the advances of the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led
coalition. That being said, [the Houthis have lost a lot of ground since
the apex of their territorial control in the spring of
2015]{.underline}, when they also controlled Aden and Taizz, the second
and third largest cities in Yemen, the legendary Marib Dam, and Yemen's
entire Red Sea coast. In the last three years, the Yemeni military and
the coalition liberated Aden, Marib Dam, much of Taizz, the Bab
el-Mandab Strait and half of Yemen's 420 kilometer Red Sea coast, in
addition to driving Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) out of
Mukalla city, nearby ports and Yemen's key energy export pipeline
corridors. [The next coalition gain is likely to be the ports of
Hodeidah and Saleef, plus the remainder of the Red Sea coastal plain.
The fight will be tough, because the Houthis know that the loss of the
coast will leave them landlocked for the first time since they seized
control of the Red Sea port of Midi in 2011]{.underline}. Having an
opening to the sea allowed the Houthi militia Ansar Allah to acquire
modern armaments and training from Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah,
including Iranian-manufactured Qiam 1 medium-range ballistic missiles
capable of striking Riyadh. [While the Houthi defense will be strong,
their forces in Hodeidah are heavily outnumbered by advancing Yemeni and
coalition troops, and locally-recruited Houthi allies are likely to flip
sides as the Houthis lose terrain]{.underline}. Already, UAE-backed
Yemeni brigades are wrapping around the northeastern quarter of Hodeidah
city, placing them within striking distance of the port and the last
road through which the Houthis can draw reinforcements or escape. If
Hodeidah is liberated this year, as seems likely, the question is then
whether the war has reached a point of equilibrium, with the south, east
and west liberated, while the Houthis remain quite capable of defending
the northern highlands and Sanaa. When visiting the Nihm front in March
this year, I GPS'd my position just 38.9 kilometers outside the US
Embassy in Sanaa. But this last stretch is the longest, because the
Yemeni military lacks the numbers or the cohesion to assault the
capital. The Houthis have no incentive to bargain away their control of
Sanaa in UN-brokered talks, and will likely value the capital even more
highly if they lose control of their coastline. It could take years for
the Yemeni military---split between loyalists of the late Ali Abdullah
Saleh and pro-Muslim Brotherhood Islah Party members---to build the
capabilities and unity needed to assault Sanaa. In the meantime, there
is one other option for the Saudi-led coalition. This is a direct
assault on Saada, the heartland of the Houthi clan, and it has arguably
already begun. On the northwestern side of Saada, Saudi Arabian forces
are penetrating Al Malahidh district in the foothills of the Marran
Mountains, the Houthi stronghold facing Jizan province, placing them 60
kilometers from Saada. To the northeast of Saada, Yemeni and Sudanese
forces backed by the coalition are 20 kilometers from Kitaf, a town 50
kilometers from Saada that Saudi-backed Salafis view as a spiritual
center. To the south of Saada, two coalition thrusts are slowly pushing
from the west and east to cut Saada off from Sanaa---one group of
Saudi-backed Yemeni and Sudanese forces coming from the coastal plain
and one Yemeni front coming from the east, striking out from Al Maton
district in Al Jawf province. Though coalition progress is slow and
costly on these fronts, Saudi Arabia feels it has plenty of time and
more than enough forces to continue gaining ground in Saada province[.
If the Houthis are cut off from Iranian resupply and begin to suffer
rolling defections, the rate of advance could increase. Saudi Arabia has
quietly ramped up its direct contribution, deploying large elements of
six Saudi Arabian National Guard and Royal Saudi Land Forces brigades
into Saada]{.underline}. Riyadh is also replacing Yemeni battlefield
losses in armored vehicles directly from Saudi Arabia's mammoth
equipment reserves. As importantly, some of the most experienced Salafi
fighters in Yemen, currently serving in large numbers on the Hodeidah
front, are likely to be released for operations on the Kitaf front soon,
where many of them fought the Houthis in 2004-2014. [The Gulf coalition
believes that the Houthis currently have no incentive to withdraw from
Hodeidah or Sanaa, which was graphically demonstrated when they failed
to show up at the Geneva peace talks this month. This assessment is
probably correct. For hardliners within the Houthi leadership, any
agreement will probably result in them losing their current dominance in
Sanaa and on the Red Sea coast]{.underline}. The coalition is likely to
keep pushing militarily in order to shift this calculus. For Saudi
Arabia, it is preferable to support a multi-year, or even multi-decade,
war of attrition rather than let a southern Hezbollah establish itself
on the Red Sea. The war may be deadlocked this year, but neither the
Houthis nor Riyadh have short-term agendas in Yemen.

#### Control of hodeidah is the impediment to stopping famine; houthis

**Block, 18** (Joshua S. Block, [a communications, foreign policy and
political strategist who has been involved in national politics and
policy for nearly 20 years. "Control of hodeidah" The Jerusalem
Post)]{.mark}

Now that UN peace efforts appear to be falling apart, [the war in Yemen
is approaching a decisive battle for control of the port of Hodeidah.
Iran's role in intensifying a conflict of already epic proportions is
testimony to the White House's decision to re-impose sanctions on the
Iranian regime, and thereby limit cash flow to Tehran's regional proxy
forces.]{.underline} [Hodeidah is Yemen's lifeline. Approximately
twothird of total imports -- including vital food, healthcare and
clothing -- enter the country through the port city. Hodeidah is also
the principle gateway through which Iran channels illicit arms to the
Zaydi Shia Houthi rebels. The Houthis have controlled the strategic port
city of a half million people since 2014. The insurgency group has been
found time and again to mismanage vital humanitarian deliveries in order
to serve their selfish political ends. Human rights groups have accused
the movement of blocking aid deliveries, threatening volunteers and
blocking the transfer of wounded civilians in a cynical infringement of
basic humanitarian law. Over 22 million Yemenis -- almost the entire
population -- are in urgent need of assistance. Some 16 million lack
access to safe water and are at severe risk of malnutrition, while
50,000 died from cholera last year alone, according to data from the
UN]{.underline}. Last week, the World Health Organization warned that
the war-torn country is on the brink of a third cholera epidemic. It is
therefore imperative for the UN to take this lifeline out of Houthi
control. [The UN has proposed a plan under which the Houthis would turn
over the city to a neutral international regime to guarantee
humanitarian access to millions of civilians. The Houthis, however,
appear to have exploited the peace negotiations to further entrench
their forces in Hodeidah, actively recruiting children]{.underline} as
young as 15 to fight on the frontlines. The situation is grim, and the
chances for peace appear to have dimmed considerably. Houthi activity in
the city has intensified, and the group has made it clear that there are
no terms under which they will hand over the city to an internationally-
supervised operation. IN LATE JULY, the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil
tankers in international waters, after which Saudi Arabia announced the
temporary cessation of all oil shipments through the Bab el-Mandeb
Strait -- one of the world's most important commercial shipping lanes.
In the latest flare-up of violence, t[he insurgency group attacked a
fish market in Hodeidah, which according to medical sources, took the
lives of at least 26 people. The Houthis can wage this campaign of
aggression only because of the support they receive from their Iranian
masters]{.underline}. The Houthis are a desert tribe. They previously
had neither access to nor training in sophisticated weapons. It is clear
that the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM), which
provides clearance for commercial shipping to Houthi-controlled
territory, has failed to stop the flow of illicit arms to the rebels.
Since the war broke out and the Houthis unseated the legitimate
government of Yemen, the group has received training, expertise and
weapons from Iran and Hezbollah. A report by the British All Party
Parliamentary Group for Yemen revealed in May that Tehran has supplied
the Houthis with anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles and sea mines as
part of a pattern of nefarious behavior around the region. "Several
illicit arms shipments from Iran to Yemen have been confiscated by
international patrols, despite a UN embargo on arms transfers from Iran,
which constitute a direct violation of UN Security Council Resolution
2231," the APPG said. [Whoever controls Hodeidah holds the balance of
power, and the liberation of Yemen's strategic sea port could be the
beginning to ending the war. It is a major source of revenue for the
Houthis, and cutting their supply lines is central to forcing them back
into the mountains and away from the Red Sea. This development would not
only strengthen the stability of the region, it would also enhance the
security of Western countries concerned with Iran's aggressive
expansionism.]{.underline}

#### Problems with leaving the war

for Saudi Arabia in Yemen Would Trigger Dangerous Consequences,"The

In a new resolution, a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the
United States to end its involvement---specifically its support of Saudi
Arabia---in the Yemen conflict. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to
pass a procedural measure that will clear the way for a floor debate on
the issue next week. The push comes largely in response to the recent
murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Trump administration has
banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder from entering the U.S., imposed
sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and expressed its willingness to take
further action if warranted by ongoing investigations. Many senators
seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even if it means sacrificing the
interests of the Yemeni government and making a negotiated settlement of
the conflict more difficult. The killing of Khashoggi was certainly
abhorrent, but [ending U.S. support for the multinational coalition in
Yemen is not the proper solution]{.underline}. It risks dangerously
conflating two separate issues and would inevitably trigger unintended
consequences that would undermine U.S. national security interests in
the region. Senators must remember that [Saudi Arabia is not the only
belligerent in Yemen. A cutoff of U.S. support would also hurt the
elected and internationally recognized government of Yemen]{.underline},
which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup
that violated a U.N.-brokered ceasefire. Withdrawing U.S. support would
also harm the interests of other U.S. allies fighting in Yemen,
including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The war in Yemen is
complex. [Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia entirely for the
suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes and heavy-handed
treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents]{.underline} and
the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah
("Supporters of Allah") movement, a Shia Islamist extremist group. [The
Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian
casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But the Houthis should
not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly
sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles. Ansar Allah also deserves
criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the
conditions that led to the current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah
regularly]{.underline} attacks the Saudi border, launches missiles
strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and [diverts
international medical and food aid to favor its own supporters and sell
on the black market.]{.underline} Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S.
Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian shipping in the Red
Sea with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs.
Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this
threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to
threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz. [Those who advocate
withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can
somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy
that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group that chants "Death
to America" and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese proxy
group]{.underline}, every day. Never mind that Saudi Arabia is
supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this
effort. [Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring
an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it.
The]{.underline} U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi
Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing. There
are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional
commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S.
homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries. The
Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi
warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated
settlement. But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies
and hope for the best. [Undermining the Yemeni government and the
Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement
impossible. The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to
fight this war with or without U.S. support.]{.underline} Those who
would connect two unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and
ignore Iran's hostile role inside Yemen will only do more harm to
innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and its Yemeni proxies.

**[The chief of Houthi rebels
in ]{.underline}[Yemen](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html)[ has
said he will \"never surrender\" to Saudi-backed pro-government
forces]{.underline}** as a fierce battle for control of a key port city
deepens the humanitarian crisis.

\"**[Does the enemy think that penetrating this or that area, or seizing
this or that area, means we will be convinced that we should surrender
and hand over control?\"]{.underline}** **[Abdel-Malik
al-Houthi said]{.underline}** on Wednesday in a televised address. \
\
\"**[This is not happening and will not happen ever]{.underline}**,\" he
said, according to AFP news agency.

Hodeidah is a strategic port for humanitarian aid and is the entry point
for over 70 percent of imports into Yemen, the poorest country in the
Arab world.

**[Nearly 200 fighters have been ]{.underline}[killed in the fierce
battle ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/yemen-fighting-flares-hodeidah-calls-peace-181105152755695.html)[on
the outskirts of rebel-held Hodeidah since last week, including at least
27 Houthi rebels and 12 pro-government fighters in the past 24
hours.]{.underline}**

The Houthi rebels appeared to acknowledge they have lost ground in the
battle for Hodeidah and accused pro-government forces of provoking an
escalation in violence.

\"**[The enemy benefits from its numbers, which it has increased even
further to pressure the city of Hodeidah,\" said the chief of the Houthi
rebels]{.underline}**.

His statement came shortly after Saudi-backed forces said they
have pounded rebel positions with an air attack and a ground assault,
and now control a major road leading to the port city.

Yemeni military officials and witnesses on both sides of the Hodeidah
front line on Wednesday said the alliance secured an urban area along
50th Street, which leads to the Red Sea port about 5km away.

turned [Yemen](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Yemen) into one of
the world's worst humanitarian disasters. The bulk of the criticism has
been placed on the Saudi-led coalition as well as the western countries
which arm it. But if we want to achieve peace in the region we need to
start to take into consideration the atrocities the [Houthi
rebels](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/houthi-rebels) have also
committed.]{.underline} In September 2014, [Houthi rebels, who only
represent a small minority of the population in Yemen, attacked the
capital city of Sanaa and seized it. Many Yemenis called this a coup
against the elected and internationally recognised Yemeni government.
The Houthis were able to take the capital in just a few days thanks to
the backing they received from

[[has been providing Houthi

with missiles which have targeted [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SaudiArabia)]{.underline},
and seems likely to continue to do so regardless of UN sanctions. The
war in Yemen is a proxy for Iran's war against Saudi Arabia, as part of
its wider Shia Crescent strategy, which aims to link a network of allies
spanning from the border with Iraq to Lebanon in a crescent shape. In
February 2014, the head of [the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) Quds forces, Qasem Soleimani, in a meeting with Iranian armed
forces,]{.underline}
[[explained](https://www.farsnews.com/news/13921127001191/%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7-%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%88-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B7)
the motivation behind Iran's strategy in the region, dubbed the Shia
Crescent. He said: "The Shia Crescent is not political but it is
actually an economic crescent]{.underline}, as Shias hold 80 per cent of
the world's oil in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Iran."
**[Without understanding this core reason behind the Houthi offensive,
achieving peace in Yemen is nigh on impossible -- any plan to end the
war without putting more pressure on Iran to dismantle its Quds forces
is highly likely to fail]{.underline}**, as we've seen since the
beginning of this conflict. **[Houthis are merely a proxy of the IRGC's
Quds forces]{.underline}**. However, [now that Iran is under intense
pressure by the current US administration and its own people, it can no
longer continue to arm and sponsor the Houthis like before]{.underline}.
Consequently, Houthi rebels have been pushed to show willingness in
negotiations for the time being. Nevertheless, **[it is important to
remember that Houthi rebels have refused to join any peace talks to end
the war in Yemen in the past.]{.underline}** According to Kamal
Kharrazi, the head of Iran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations,
Tehran is negotiating with European countries about the Yemen crisis
and, according to Iranian media, the war was the top priority of the
discussion between British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Iranian
officials on Monday. [But from the Iranian perspective, a ceasefire in
Yemen is only crucial for the time being because it needs to focus on
domestic economic challenges as the country hopes to ease US sanctions.
It is hard to imagine they are truly seeking a peaceful resolution to
the conflict, as it remains a key part of their wider regional strategy
of expanding their influence]{.underline}. Indeed, look at other
countries where Iran has sought to impose its influence -- namely Iraq,
Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, which are extremely divided and unstable.
There is little reason to assume Iran's intentions are different in
Yemen. This suggests the main reason behind Houthi rebels announcing
halting attacks on the Saudi-led coalition is linked to Iran's current
domestic problems, as opposed to a genuine willingness to find peace in
the region. [Yemen is not an isolated war but intrinsically linked to
Iran's wider regional strategy. Unless this aspect begins to be
highlighted more insistently, it is difficult to see any lasting peace
in Yemen -- a treaty could be signed, but as Iran faces other problems
it could return to destabilising Yemen because it is a crucial part of
Iran's Shia Crescent into Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} It is highly
unlikely Iran will stop pursuing its belligerent efforts to establish
its Shia Crescent in the long run because that is the very essence and
purpose of the Islamic regime of Iran. This poses a great threat to the
stability in the region, and threatens Saudi Arabia and Bahrain which
have significant Shia population in their countries. In relation to
this, James Mattis, US defence secretary, recently
[stated](https://dod.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1674583/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-international-institute-for-strategic-studies-ma/)
that [the US has significant evidence which indicates Iran has been
transferring a significant amount of weapons into Bahrain**. Such
evidence is an indication of how serious Iran's destabilising role in
the region is, and how determined it is to establish a Shia
Crescent**]{.underline}, which must be taken into consideration by the
international community. **[It is crucial to put pressure on Iran to
dismantle its Quds forces because herein lies the key to peace in the
region and in Yemen. The wars in the [Middle
East](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MiddleEast) are part of wider
geopolitical tensions, and Yemen cannot be dealt with in isolation of
the rest of the region's instability, which the Quds forces have a lot
to answer for.]{.underline}**

The bombing also destroyed much of Yemen's already-tottering
infrastructure, making medical care and food distribution even more
difficult. Less visibly, but more deadly, the Saudi blockade of many of
Yemen's ports and airport---done in the name of stopping Iranian arms
from entering Yemen---has
[prevented](https://www.msf.org/yemen-saudi-coalition-urged-immediately-allow-humanitarian-access-during-blockade)

the Houthis' dependence on Iran for arms and financial support. In
addition, the court of world opinion has come to see Saudi Arabia, not
Iran, as the aggressor in the conflict, and it is Saudi Arabia whose
reputation is damaged by the ongoing disaster there. Yet **[[even if

## "If the collation puts an end to its attacks, the Yemeni Army will stop its operations," al-Houthi said, adding that the recent attacks of the Yemeni Army on Saudi targets are in response to 5 years of Riyadh's continued attacks on the impoverished country. He underlined that the drone and missile attacks by the Yemeni Army are not intended to further escalate tensions, adding that the attacks are the natural response to the Saudi-led aggressions and bombardments in the past 5 years. "The real enemy is the one who keeps conducting operations even using internationally-prohibited weapons and we are just confronting their continuous attacks against our country," he highlighted, adding, "We keep resisting with whatever we have, and we, along with the defense ministry, respond to the Saudi-led attacks with appropriate operations at the right time." Earlier, the Yemeni Army stopped its drone and missile attacks to support ceasefire efforts, but the Saudi-led coalition inferred that they have achieved a victory and \[our\] missiles and drone are run out, he said. The Yemeni resistance figure went on recounting that when Yemeni defense officials found out that the Saudi-led coalition is keeping committing crimes with its aggressions, and reached the conclusions that honoring ceasefire is useless, they decided to restart operations to respond to attacks with available means. "The coalition of aggressors is the side which is actively following the policy to lead the peace initiative into failure, and it has never contributed to this cause. For the sake of peace, we proposed a plan to halt drone and missile operations, our military operations in the sea, our military operations along the terrestrial borders all across the map of the Republic of Yemen, but they never took a step, and they just talk," he underlined, speaking to Lebanese journalist Najlaa Aboumerhi who hosted the program. He totally rejected that Yemen received any help from Iran, adding that his country is ready to stop its military operations if the coalition stops its attacks against Yemenis, adding, "This is the best piece of evidence to attest that we are not in touch with Tehran. Because we are not undertaking measures for the helps, which the Saudi led coalition claims, we are receiving from Tehran, but for the reason that our nation is targeted by the coalition and its crimes." "Yemen is not an arm for Iran, and if it was as they claim that Iran was an arm for Yemen, we would have never said that we were ready to stop attacks if the coalition stopped its attacks," the Yemeni resistance figure underscored. Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen since March 2015 to restore power to fugitive president Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. The Saudi-led aggression has so far killed more than 20,000 Yemenis, including hundreds of women and children. Despite Riyadh's claims that it is bombing the positions of the Ansarullah fighters, Saudi bombers are flattening residential areas and civilian infrastructures. Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis with more than 22 million people in need and is seeing a spike in needs, fueled by ongoing conflict, a collapsing economy and diminished social services and livelihoods. The blockade on Yemen has smothered humanitarian deliveries of food and medicine to the import-dependent state. The UN has repeatedly criticized the Saudi-UAE-led military coalition's bombing campaign and placed it on a blacklist of child rights violators last year. A UN panel has also compiled a detailed report of civilian casualties caused by the Saudi military and its allies during their war against Yemen, saying the Riyadh-led coalition has used precision-guided munitions in its raids on civilian targets.

##   US Cred

###   Trump thumper

#### Iran, and other small conflicts are alt causes to US credibility

National Security Network, \"Trump's Iran Accusations Put U.S.
Credibility on the Line,\" Intelligencer,

(CB)

**[The [Trump]{.mark} administration [wasted]{.mark} little time in
alleging that Iran was behind the]{.underline}** **[[Thursday-morning
attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-attack-gulf-oman.html)
that left two tankers ablaze in the Gulf of Oman]{.underline}**, dozens
of crew members in need of rescue, and the stability of oil transport in
the Persian Gulf in question. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the
accusation the same day; by Friday morning, military spokespeople were
presenting video to back up their claims. **[As one would expect, Iran
and its friends, Washington's geopolitical foes, pushed back
immediately. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani took the opportunity to
[call](https://www.ft.com/content/8791be48-8e93-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37)
the U.S. government "a serious threat to the stability of the region and
the world."]{.underline}** Perhaps more surprising --- and telling ---
were those who had little or nothing to say. Close U.S. allies outside
the region, even Norway and Japan, where the two damaged tankers were
registered, were silent or urged caution. Even the U.K., typically
Washington's closest ally on security matters, hedged its statement with
"if" and said it would conduct its own inquiry. Then came a truly
surprising remark from the British foreign secretary: The "[starting
point is obviously to believe our U.S.
allies](https://twitter.com/fravel/status/1139252483778371585)." So we
have now arrived at the moment when Washington's closest ally thinks
it's necessary to say it believes us --- even as it acts in a way that
suggests it doesn't. Oddly**[, the video Washington released does appear
to show men in a type of boat used by Iran removing an object that could
be a mine from the side of one of the tankers, but that tanker's owner
[says](https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1139474410321207298) it
appears to have been hit by a "flying object," not a
mine.]{.underline}** My American colleagues, friends, and family from
outside the Beltway often ask me whether those of us who make Washington
our home understand how dire our global situation looks to them from
farther away, how concerned they are about our safety and our kids'
future. My foreign friends are generally too polite to ask --- they just
look at me a bit differently and offer to pay for my drinks. So here's
the answer: yes. All my adult life, security-policy professionals in
Washington trusted and stood up for each other across administrations
and party lines. We gave each other the benefit of the doubt even when
sometimes we should have been quicker to speak up. Yesterday, the
internet was full of Iran experts and defense wonks pointing out that
Iran is fully capable of blowing up oil tankers, that the nation and its
proxies have done far worse and would no doubt do so again. But you
couldn't find people unaffiliated with the administration coming out
with confidence to back Secretary Pompeo or to agree that the photos
released this morning sealed the case. Kelly Magsamen, who started her
career in the George W. Bush administration, worked on his National
Security Council, and stayed to work for Barack Obama before moving to a
senior job at the Pentagon, is exactly the kind of official who would
always have given colleagues from the other party the benefit of the
doubt. But there she was on Twitter,
[speaking](https://twitter.com/kellymagsamen/status/1139238814805909509)
for many who couldn't bring themselves to put fingers to keyboard:

T**[he cautious responses coming from the European Union, Japan,
Norway,]{.underline}** and elsewhere **[reflect]{.underline}** a shared
**[concern]{.underline}** **[that a spiral of attacks and allegations
will lead to a full-blown war in the Gulf]{.underline}**, or even
something lesser but still profoundly damaging to the global economy,
and perhaps unleash a new round of extremist violence outside the
region. **[By Friday morning, though, oil prices were holding steady,
and Reuters
[reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-attacks-insurance/ship-insurance-costs-soar-after-middle-east-tanker-attacks-idUSL8N23L2ND)
that insurance for tankers in the region had risen by 10 percent and was
headed higher]{.underline}**, as analysts said instability had reached
levels not "seen since the U.S. war in Iraq in 2003." **[Even as the
Japanese tanker was attacked, Tokyo's prime minister --- a close partner
to Trump and the leader of a country that is profoundly dependent on the
steady flow of oil out of the Gulf]{.underline}** --- was in Iran trying
to lower tensions. Japan's awkward position is a good reminder of just
how profoundly international the commerce in the Gulf is. Sailors from
the stricken tankers wound up on U.S. and Iranian vessels, with a Dutch
tugboat also participating in the rescue. Many of our allies have an
interest in avoiding conflict in the region and see no good coming from
war. They will continue working to encourage Washington and Tehran to
back down. At some point, **[evidence may well emerge that shows Iran
was responsible]{.underline}**. It's also not impossible that one of
Iran's Gulf opponents, who see themselves gaining from a conflict that
binds Washington to them and weakens Tehran, was behind it. **[If more
of these relatively small provocations continue to happen, which seems
certain]{.underline}**, **[the sides will grow further apart, the list
of grievances will get longer, and the off-ramps to defuse confrontation
will crumble. American credibility, at least in some quarters, will be a
side casualty of that. And because the entire U.S. security
establishment is involved in pressing this case, the credibility of the
entire establishment, not just its current leaders, is what's being
lost. The next president --- and the world --- had best not plan on
being able to regain that credibility to lessen the chances of conflict.
And the people who most love U.S. security institutions need to think
harder and more creatively about how to rebuild from where we are. Just
changing leaders, if we're lucky enough to get there, isn't going to be
enough.]{.underline}**

Fourth of July celebrations into a [partisan,

heading into this holiday weekend, with any luck, the rest of the world
wasn't paying much attention. After all, there are plenty of more
pressing concerns around the world: the deaths of [14 service

[protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-explained.html)
in Hong Kong and Sudan, and immense humanitarian catastrophes in Yemen

foundational U.S. alliances. They see a president whose go-to strategy
in places like China, Iran, and North Korea is to worsen a
crisis]{.underline}**, **[then attempt to solve the problem via personal
diplomacy]{.underline}** (though somehow Washington is always left in a
substantively worse position). And of course, they're troubled by the
dearth of competent American diplomats and the Trump cronies who've
replaced them, whether it's Jared Kushner naïvely asserting that only he
knows how to [make Middle East
peace](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/06/jared-kushner-middle-east-peace-conference/)
or Ivanka Trump's [unwelcome

at the G20. **[Many in the U.S. view these issues as Trump-generated
controversies that will clear up once he's out of office]{.underline}**.
**[But the challenge for the post-Trump United States, assuming we get
there, is that many foreign leaders don't see this administration as a
forgettable blip from which we can all move on.]{.underline}** You can
see this reflected, of all places, in global commentary on the fortunes
of the U.S. women's soccer team. They --- and certainly their fans ---
see themselves as
[resisters](https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/u-s-womens-soccer-team-defends-rapinoe-trump-white-house.html),
as carriers of a vision of the U.S. that is progressive and open, as
well as just plain awesome. But their critics see them as [overbearing
and
obnoxious](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7130947/US-team-slammed-disgusting-obnoxious-celebrations.html)
--- the latest in a line of American imperialists that includes Trump
but runs back long before him. (And that was before the
[trouncing](https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2019/06/world-cup-2019-uswnt-vs-france-match-report-stats-standings-bracket)
of their French hosts and a [Boston Tea Party--inspired

against England.) Fair to the players? Not really. A reality Americans
in all walks of life will have to deal with going forward? You bet. So
as you prepare to watch the final this weekend, imagine that it's
Trump's 2020 opponents out there on the field. Okay, once you're done
laughing at the idea of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders rolling on the turf
feigning injuries, seriously, imagine that it's January 2021, and
consider the list of challenges the winner will face. H**[ow does the
next president keep North Korea from going right back to testing
missiles and weapons in order to get attention? It's not as if Kim
Jong-un has any incentive to be nice, knowing he will never have a
better friend in the White House than he does right now.]{.underline}**
**[The same goes for Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has thousands
more nuclear weapons, more avenues for threatening the U.S., and much
more to lose, as he thinks he's locked in a competition with every
American president for world leader. Those two actors alone
will]{.underline}** **[make life very uncomfortable for the next U.S.
president. Other regimes experiencing whiplash from Trump's
inconsistency, China and Iran, will likely be hoping for more stability
--- but they'll also be unwilling to look weak before a new U.S.
president]{.underline}**. In both cases, **[the U.S. president will be
dealing with substantially weakened negotiating positions and sky-high
public expectations]{.underline}**. **[Trump has not yet obtained a
single significant change in how China runs its economy, but he's led
the American public to believe such changes are possible;]{.underline}**
since Trump scrapped the 2015 nuclear agreement, the situation with Iran
has only grown more volatile. And of course, the next president will
face a variety of other transnational challenges, like terrorism,
climate change, and a global economy that is expected to start
weakening.

#### The Trump administration is not credibile in any case

**Waldman**, **1-8**-2019 (Paul, Swarthmore College, BA in Political
Science; University of Pennsylvania, PhD in Communication Washington
Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/01/08/no-one-trump-administration-has-any-credibility-left/)

Something curious is happening right now: The president of the United
States will give a prime-time address on an urgent political
controversy, and pretty much everyone acknowledges that in that address
he is going to lie to the American people. The TV networks, which often
have aired such speeches when the president asks, are struggling to
figure out how to handle it; they seem to have decided that allowing a
Democratic response, plus some post-hoc fact-checking, will fulfill
their journalistic responsibilities. But there's something else going on
here, too. **[This administration is so morally and intellectually
degraded that there is not a single major figure within it who retains
credibility]{.underline}** with the press or the public. **[In the midst
of a political crisis, there is no administration official whose word we
can take on anything.]{.underline}** For context, I want to look back on
a relevant episode from the recent past. In 2002 and 2003, George W.
Bush's administration was waging one of the great propaganda efforts in
U.S. history to convince the public that if we didn't invade Iraq,
Saddam Hussein would soon attack us with his fearsome arsenal of weapons
of mass destruction. As Vice President Richard B. Cheney [put it in a
speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/26/international/middleeast/full-text-in-cheneys-words.html),
"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of
mass destruction; there is no doubt that he is amassing them to use
against our friends, against our allies, and against us." This was a
lie, and though most of the public seemed to be buying it, as it
approached the time when Bush was ready to launch the invasion, the
administration needed a rhetorical coup de grace to make the momentum
for war unstoppable. So they turned to Secretary of State Colin Powell,
a former general who was not only known to be harboring some skepticism
about the case for invading, but who was also held in such high esteem
by both the news media and the public that not only would he be given
the benefit of the doubt, but just about anything he said would be
assumed to be unimpeachable. **[Powell gave a speech to the U.N.
Security Council in February 2003]{.underline}**, **[laying out the
administration's case for war]{.underline}** --- **[a speech we would
[later
learn](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/02/un-deception-what-exactly-colin-powell-knew-five-years-ago-and-what-he-told-world/)
was as full of falsehoods, distortions and tendentious claims as
everything else coming out of the administration at the
time]{.underline}**. But the reception to the speech, just as the
administration hoped, was positively rapturous. Such was Powell's
reputation that if he said it, nearly the entire news media concluded,
it had to be true. Th**[e point of this story is that Powell's
credibility was a potent resource on which the administration could
draw.]{.underline}** **[It happened that they drew on it in service of
propagating lies to enable a catastrophic wa]{.underline}**r, but in
theory they could have drawn on it to justify something worthwhile. But
try to imagine something like that happening today. Which of President
Trump's senior aides would be able to come before the public and say,
"These are the facts, and this is what we must do about them," and be
taken seriously? Indeed, **[these days when administration officials do
interviews, they're forced to spend much of their time defending the
lies their boss has told on the issue at hand.]{.underline}** **[That's
what happened when Vice President Pence did a round of interviews to
make the case that we're facing a "crisis" on the border]{.underline}**
that justifies a government shutdown and the declaration of a national
emergency that would allow Trump to exercise powers not ordinarily
available to the president. **[Pence's ability to spin was put to the
test, with sad results, as he was questioned about Trump's lie that
previous presidents [told
him](https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1082611187311886336) they
wished they had built a wall on the southern border]{.underline}**, and
the lie the administration is telling that
[thousands](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vp-pence-claims-crisis-southern-border-bona-fide)
of suspected terrorists have been apprehended trying to come in from
Mexico. The vice president isn't going to convince anyone who isn't
already in Trump's camp of what the administration would like the
country to believe. The president's press secretary may be the most
shamelessly dishonest person ever to occupy that post, which is saying
something. The secretary of homeland security is a joke. The acting
attorney general is a widely viewed as a contemptible sycophant grossly
unqualified for his position. And the person with the highest reputation
among Trump officials, former defense secretary Jim Mattis, just quit in
disgust. That isn't to say that Trump doesn't have a few people in his
administration who have managed to hold on to their reputations. But
they have done so only by being invisible. It isn't as though the
administration is going to say, "The American people must know why the
flow of asylum seekers at the border is such an urgent crisis. Here to
make that case ... Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao!" **[With no
one else able to convince the public, Trump himself --- the one with the
least credibility of all --- is set to step up to do the job himself.
And he will fail.]{.underline}**

can American diplomats assure their counterparts they know who is in
charge, that what they claim is American policy actually is
policy]{.underline}**, **[and that\... that\... in some way the
president of the United States is not more sympathetic to an adversary
than to his allies? No American diplomat today can answer to those
points. It was thus unsurprising Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [had
little to
say](https://www.politico.eu/article/dnald-trump-aides-face-calls-to-resign-after-vladimir-putin-helsinki-summit/)
in Helsinki. America's global needs cannot wait out a Trump presidency,
nor do they appear able to wait out whatever investigative process has
been underway through two administrations]{.underline}**. American
intelligence officials began looking into "Russiagate" two years ago,
with little substantive action taken by the Obama administration. The
process has continued on the intelligence side undisturbed, along with
new efforts by various parts of Congress, and by Special Counsel Robert
Mueller. The multiple threads do not appear driven by a sense of crisis,
and that is wrong. There have of course been far worse moments in
American history: the presidents who watched helplessly as the storm
over slavery broke into Civil War, FDR and the Japanese internment
camps, Richard Nixon [bombing Vietnamese
civilians](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/exhibits/decbomb/chapter-v.html)
and prolonging the Vietnam war to help get himself reelected, and George
W. Bush setting the Middle East aflame. But we are here now, and **[the
message from Helsinki is that it's time for Washington's investigators
either to present evidence that Trump or his close associates actively
worked with the Russian government]{.underline}**, and thus remain
beholden to it, or make it clear that is not the case. **[Getting things
done in the world requires credibility, and it is now time to set aside
chasing indictments that will never see the inside of a courtroom, those
concerning financial crimes unconnected to the campaign, and a clumsy
series of perjury cases. Post-Helsinki, we -- America's diplomats, its
allies, its people -- need to know who is running the United
States.]{.underline}**

##   US Heg Bad

#### The Rising Power will try to gain hegemony, but this will result in a war.

Graham **Allison, 24-09-2015**, \"The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and
China Headed for War?,\" Atlantic,
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/

**[[The defining question about global order]{.mark} for this generation
[is whether China and the United States can escape Thucydides's Trap.
The [Greek historian's
metaphor](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.1.first.html) reminds
us of the]{.mark}]{.underline}** attendant **[[dangers when a rising
power rivals a ruling power]{.mark}---as Athens challenged Sparta in
ancient Greece, or as Germany did Britain a century ago. [Most such
contests have ended badly, often for both nations, a
team]{.mark}]{.underline}** of mine **[[at the Harvard Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs has concluded after [analyzing the
historical
record](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/25760/thucydides_trap_project.html).]{.underline}]{.mark}**
In 12 of 16 cases over the past 500 years, the result was war. When the
parties avoided war, it required huge, painful adjustments in attitudes
and actions on the part not just of the challenger but also the
challenged. **[[Based on the current trajectory, war between the United
States and China in the decades ahead is]{.mark} not just possible, but
[much more likely than recognized at the moment.]{.mark} Indeed, judging
by the historical record, war is more likely]{.underline}** than not.
Moreover, current underestimations and misapprehensions of the hazards
inherent in the U.S.-China relationship contribute greatly to those
hazards. A risk associated with Thucydides's Trap is that business as
usual---not just an unexpected, extraordinary event---can trigger
large-scale conflict. **[When a rising power is threatening to displace
a ruling power, standard crises that would otherwise be contained, like
the assassination of an archduke in 1914, can initiate a cascade of
reactions that, in turn, produce outcomes none of the parties would
otherwise have chosen. [However unimaginable conflict seems]{.mark},
however catastrophic the potential consequences for all actors, however
deep the cultural empathy among leaders, even blood relatives, [and
however economically interdependent states may be---none of these
factors is sufficient to prevent war]{.mark}, in 1914 or
today.]{.underline}**

#### The rising challenger(china) will present the US with a choice---it's a choice between war or peace. 

Asle Toje, 2016, "Will China's Rise Be Peaceful?" Oxford University
Press,
<https://books.google.com/books?id=vA5EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT108&lpg=PT108&dq=the+hegemon+must+dig+its+heels&source=bl&ots=q-RiNc3icm&sig=ACfU3U172-K1Qtf_xIDtUgLyu82PsKCIcw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjTk8XDgLPjAhXWHTQIHeM_ChgQ6AEwBHoECGMQAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20hegemon%20must%20dig%20its%20heels&f=false>

Over time, however, **[[the relative power of states changes, and
eventually the international order no longer reflects that actual
distribution of power,]{.mark} between the great powers. When that
happens, [and the legitimacy of the prevailing power is put into
question.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As its power increases, **[[the rising
challenger becomes]{.mark} increasingly [dissatisfied with the
international order and seeks to revise]{.mark} it. The challenger wants
to revise the rules embodied in the existing international order --rules
written, of course, by the once-dominant but now declining great
power]{.underline}** that created the existing order. [**The incumbent
hegemon, of course, wants to preserve the existing international order
as is---an order that is created to advance its interests**. The E.H.
Carr moment presents the incumbent hegemon with a choice. **It can dig
in its heels and try and preserve the existing international order and
its privileged position therein, or it can accede to the rising
challenger's demands for revision. If it chooses the former course of
action, it runs the risk of war with the dissatisfied challenger. If it
chooses the latter, it must come to terms with the reality of its
decline and the end of its hegemonic position.**]{.underline} [The Carr
moment is where the geopolitical rubber meets the road: **The status quo
powers must choose between accommodating or opposing the revisionist
demands of the rising power.**]{.underline}

#### Tensions already high due to the trade war.

Chinese direct investment, via the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States (CFIUS). Due in part to CFIUS, Chinese foreign direct
investment in the U.S. plummeted]{.underline}** in 2018. **[The decline
is]{.underline}** even more **[dramatic]{.underline}** than these
numbers suggest**[, since China [also

substantially in the U.S., leading to a total net negative FDI of \$8
billion in 2018.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the failure of U.S.
interest rates or inflation to rise so far in response to slow Chinese
government divestment from U.S. bonds has [convinced
some](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/30/chinas-nuclear-option-in-the-trade-war-could-be-a-dud.html)
that the threat of dumping U.S. bonds is less disruptive than previously
believed. **[Thus, the comforting buffer of economic ties between the
U.S. and China is eroding at an accelerating pace. The two economies are
unlikely to disengage from each other, but it seems clear that they will
become less and less indispensable to each other as the trade war drags
on. That, in turn, raises the risk of conflict between the world's two
most powerful nations.]{.underline}** Norman Angell would have seen it
coming.

**Trying to maintain US Hegemony could result in a cataclysmic nuclear
war with China.**

**McNally**, **18**, \"Hurtling Towards a Hegemonic Showdown,\"
https://www.chinausfocus.com/finance-economy/hurtling-towards-a-hegemonic-showdown

**[With the imposition of tariffs on more than half of U.S.-China
bilateral trade, we have entered a fully-fledged trade war, and neither
the United States nor China looks likely to back down.]{.underline}**
**[Already U.S. President Trump has threatened tariffs on all Chinese
imports to the United States, while Chinese policy-makers have floated
the idea of differential tariffs on U.S. imports, targeting those
American goods that China can easily replace with imports from other
countries with very high tariffs. As tit-for-tat actions escalate, the
stakes are rising exponentially.]{.underline}** It all began with
Trump's focus on the large U.S. deficit in bilateral trade with China.
Then the administration's Section 301 trade investigation pinpointed
unequal market access and Chinese industrial policy practices that aim
to catch-up technologically, especially the Made in China 2025 program.
Now, Trump seems hell-bent on conducting a full-scale trade war with
far-reaching repercussions. While no longer part of the Trump
administration, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to the president, tends
to reflect the administration's hard-line views on trade. He [recently
argued](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165185/trump-wont-back-down-us-president-plans-make-trade-war)
that U.S. strategy was to make the trade war "unbearably painful" for
China and "unprecedentedly large." For Bannon, the ultimate goal is to
rebuild American manufacturing, the long-term base of any great power,
shutting out global supply chains centered on China**[. A messy divorce
of the fusion between the Chinese and American economies -- the end of
Chimerica -- looms. This raises the specter of the first "hegemonic
showdown" between the United States and China. The situation at present
is quite different]{.underline}** from the above cases. Certainly,
**[China is a rising power. It is the only country with the potential to
truly challenge the United States economically, financially,
technologically and, ultimately, militarily. But all-out war, with
nuclear weapons, would be cataclysmic and suicidal. Hegemonic
competition is thus first emerging in the economic and technological
realms. What started as a relatively minor trade skirmish that could
have been resolved with negotiations is now becoming an ever expanding
contest for economic dominance.]{.underline}** While American
politicians on both sides of the aisle do not necessarily support
Trump's tariffs, they agree on the strategic objective of containing
China's rise and preserving U.S. global dominance. Accordingly, the
Trump administration is presenting the battle over trade as the opening
skirmish in an economic cold war. China has similarly started to see the
trade war in a structural light: an attempt by the United States to
contain China's development, especially its efforts to foster indigenous
Chinese technologies that could one day rival those of the United
States.

**A Nuclear war between China and the US would result in extinction of
the human race.**

**[A nuclear war]{.underline}** using only a fraction of existing
arsenals **[would produce massive casualties on a global scale---far
more than we had previously believed]{.underline}**,\" Dr. Ira Helfand,
the report's author and IPPNW co-president, said in a statement. As
their previous report showed, **[years after even a limited nuclear war,
production of corn in the U.S. and China\'s middle season rice
production would severely decline, and fears over dwindling food
supplies would lead to hoarding and increases in food prices, creating
further food insecurity for those already reliant on food
imports.]{.underline}** The updated report adds that Chinese winter
wheat production would plummet if such a war broke out. Based on
information from new studies combining reductions in wheat, corn and
rice, this new edition doubles the **[number of people]{.underline}**
they **[expected]{.underline}** **[to be threatened by nuclear-war
induced famine to over two billion. \"The prospect of a decade of
widespread hunger and intense social and economic instability in the
world's largest country has immense implications for the entire global
community]{.underline}**, as does the possibility that the huge declines
in Chinese wheat production will be matched by similar declines in other
wheat producing countries,\" Helfand stated. **[The crops would be
impacted]{.underline}**, the report explains, citing previous studies,
**[because of the black carbon particles that would be released, causing
widespread changes like cooling temperatures, decreased precipitation
and decline in solar radiation. In this scenario of famine, epidemics of
infectious diseases would be likely]{.underline}**, the report states,
**[and could lead to armed conflict]{.underline}**. **[While a limited
nuclear war would bring dire circumstances, the impacts if the world\'s
biggest nuclear arms holders were involved would be even
worse.]{.underline}** \"**[With a large war]{.underline}** between the

It's nothing new**[. From the start, the "American Century" had nothing
to do with advancing democracy.]{.underline}** As numerous key U.S.
planning documents reveal over and over, **[the goal of that policy was
to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that "favor\[ed\]
private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for
export, and the right to bring profits out of the
country]{.underline}**," according to Noam Chomsky. Given the United
States' remarkable possession of half the world's capital after World
War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and
corporations would profit the most. "**[Since 1945, by deed and by
example]{.underline}**," the great Australian author, commentator and
filmmaker [John Pilger
wrote](https://www.newstatesman.com/north-america/2009/07/pilger-obama-america-world) nearly
nine years ago: "**[The U.S. has overthrown 50 governments, including
democracies, crushed some 30 liberation movements and supported
tyrannies from Egypt to Guatemala]{.underline}** (see [William Blum's
histories](https://www.amazon.com/William-Blum/e/B000APW3VO)).
**[Bombing is practically apple pie]{.underline}**." **[Along the way,
Washington has]{.underline}** crassly **[interfered in elections in
dozens of "sovereign" nations]{.underline}**, something curious to note
in light of current liberal U.S. outrage over real or alleged Russian
interference in "our" supposedly democratic electoral process in 2016.
**[Uncle Sam also has bombed civilians in 30 countries, attempted to
assassinate foreign leaders and deployed chemical and biological
weapons. The death count resulting from "American Era" U.S. foreign
policy runs well into the many millions, including possibly as many as 5
million Indochinese [killed by Uncle

slaughtered more than 350 unarmed civilians---including terrified women
holding babies in their arms---in South Vietnam was no isolated incident

26:3, 423-451; JB)

Conflict and US Military Spending How does one measure polarity? Power
is traditionally considered to be some combination of military and
economic strength, but despite scores of efforts, no widely accepted
formula exists. [Perhaps overall [military spending]{.mark} might be
thought of [as a proxy for hard power capabilities]{.mark}; perhaps too
the amount of money the United States devotes to hard power is a
reflection of the strength of the unipole. [When compared to conflict
levels,]{.mark} however[, there is no obvious correlation]{.mark}, and
certainly [not]{.mark} [the]{.mark} kind of negative
[relationship]{.mark} [between]{.mark} US [spending and conflict
that]{.mark} many hegemonic [stability theorists]{.mark} would
[expect]{.mark} to see.]{.underline} During the 1990s, the United States
cut back on defense by about 25 percent, spending \$100 billion less in
real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68 To those believers in the
neoconservative version of hegemonic stability, this irresponsible
"peace dividend" endangered both national and global security. "No
serious analyst of American military capabilities doubts that the
defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's
responsibilities to itself and to world peace," argued Kristol and Kagan
at the time.69 [**[The world grew]{.mark} dramatically [more peaceful
while the United States cut its forces]{.mark}, however, and stayed just
as peaceful while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist** attacks.
The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the
military budget was cut under President Clinton, in other words, and
kept declining (though more slowly, since levels were already low) as
the Bush administration ramped it back up.]{.underline} Overall US
military spending has varied during the period of the New Peace from a
low in constant dollars of less than \$400 billion to a high of more
than \$700 billion, but war does not seem to have noticed. [The same
nonrelationship exists between other potential proxy measurements for
hegemony and conflict: [there does not seem to be much connection
between warfare and fluctuations in US GDP,]{.mark} alliance
commitments, and forward military presence. There was very little
fighting in Europe when there were 300,000 US troops stationed there,
for example, and that has not changed as the number of Americans
dwindled by 90 percent. Overall, [there does not seem to be much
correlation between US actions and systemic stability. Nothing the
United States actually]{.mark} does [seems to matter to the New
Peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Theories belong to this level of analysis describe international causes
as 'external constraints' that encourage and even compel actors to form
groups and engage in war (Choucri & North, 1975; Homer-Dixon, 1991, p.
105; Waltz, 1979). [In the case of alQaeda,]{.underline} two

international system [from bipolarity to unipolarity]{.mark}**
(Monteiro, 2014)]{.underline} and its regional consequences in the
Middle East and South Asia, **[[functioned as the root
cause]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[of the rise of
al-Qaeda]{.underline}]{.mark}** at this level of analysis.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [[two factors]{.mark} were [conceived by
jihadis as 'external constraints']{.mark} that had [imposed]{.mark} an
oppressive circumstance [on]{.mark} them and [their
societies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bin Laden, 1998; Palmer & Palmer, 2008,
p. 147). [[The formation]{.mark} of al-Qaeda, in this regard, [was a
response to those 'constraints.']{.mark}]{.underline} Following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, [[the United States achieved a total
dominance in the Middle Eastern affairs]{.mark} not seen since that of
the British in the first half of the twentieth century (Murden, 2002, p.
47; Zunes, 2014, p. 73). Accordingly, [with the system shift, the
regional balance of power]{.mark} in the Middle East [disrupted]{.mark}.
Many of the Muslim [secular regimes lost their international supporter,
the Soviet Union]{.mark}, and the United States turned into an
unchallenged actor with 'intervening power' in the region]{.underline}
(Zunes, 2014, p. 73). Before the Gulf crisis, most of the Gulf
monarchies had screened their countries from US forces and security
guarantees. During the Iran--Iraq War in 1987--1988, for instance,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had refused to directly support US operation on
their behalf (Murden, 2002, p. 49). Kuwait was now a de facto
protectorate of the United States and the US, 'despite the Kingdom's
avoidance of a formal agreement,' stationed its troops in Saudi Arabia
(Murden, 2002, p. 49[). [The United States maintained a permanent Gulf
establishment of over 20,000 soldiers]{.mark}, with at least three
fighter squadrons and a carrier battle group on the station (Khalilzad &
Ochmanek, 1997, pp. 53--54). [The purpose]{.mark} of the United States'
stationing of its troops in the Gulf [was to facilitate]{.mark} the
achievement of two sets of vital interests: first [the maintenance of a
secure Israel, and second the security of oil supplies]{.mark} to the
West (Murden, 2002, p. 47). [The US new strategy]{.mark} in the Middle
East and its increasing militarization of the region [enhanced the
anti-American reaction in the Muslim world]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zunes,
2014, p. 77). The US had crossed the 'sensitivity lines' and Saudi
rulers had violated their 'religious oath' by sanctioning the permanent
stationing of 'crusader forces' in the land of Islam's holiest shrines
(Gerges, 2005, p. 148). [The [stationing of American troops in Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}, in [particularly, had]{.mark} [significant
effects]{.mark} on confronting Islamists with the United
States]{.underline}. Islamists, in general, and Salafi-Jihadists, in
particular, described the stationing of a non-Muslim troop in the land
of the two Holy Mosques an offense against the fundamentals of their
faith referring to the Prophet who stated: 'let there be no two
religions in Arabia' (Corbin, 2002, p. 27). Many Muslim scholars
interpret the Prophet's statement as 'nonMuslims should not live
anywhere on the Arabian Peninsula' (Corbin, 2002, p. 27). According to a
leading Saudi Islamist, Dr Sa'ad al-Faqih, Americans did not consider
Muslims sensitivity about the land of the two Holy Mosques by bringing
their troops in: 'during the 1990 Gulf crisis the US crossed the
psychological barriers by bringing in their forces. They failed to
remember the sensitivity' (Corbin, 2002, p. 28[). The US stationing of
its troops in Saudi Arabia and its interference in the Middle East were
clearly addressed]{.underline} BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND
POLITICAL AGGRESSION 149 [through the founding statements of al-Qaeda as
[the main reason for establishing a unified]{.mark} anti-American
[front: For more than seven years the U.S. has been occupying
th]{.mark}e lands of Islam in the [holiest of
places]{.mark}]{.underline}, plundering its riches detaching to its
rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors and turning
its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the
neighboring Muslim peoples ... \[Therefore\] the ruling to kill the
Americans and their allies -- civilians and military -- is an individual
duty for every Muslim ... This is in accordance with the words of
Almighty Allah: 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all
together'. (Bin Laden et al., 1998) Thus, because of its 'sensitivity,'
the case of Saudi Arabia provided jihadis with a political and religious
justification for organizing a unified anti-American front in order to
fight the 'occupying' force. The United States' other military moves in
the region, such as its intervention in Somalia in 1992, exacerbated the
reaction. Bin Laden's religious committee's reaction to the case of
Somalia, for example, was as 'they already took the Gulf area and now
they go to Somalia. If they succeed, it could be the South Sudan next
and they could take all the Islamic countries' (Corbin, 2002, p. 42).
[Thus, [the new regional status quo in the Middle East put the United
States and Salafi-Jihadists in a direct
confrontation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

do not contend that US influence extends equally to all corners of the
globe. The United States has concentrated its policing in what George
Kennan used to call "strong points," or the most important parts of the
world: Western Europe, the Pacific Rim, and Persian Gulf.64 64 John
Lewis Gaddis, Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of Postwar
American National Security Policy (New York: Oxford University Press,
1982). By doing so, Washington may well have contributed more to great
power peace than the overall global decline in warfare. If the former
phenomenon contributed to the latter, by essentially providing a
behavioral model for weaker states to emulate, then perhaps this lends
some support to the hegemonic-stability case.65 65 The belief that
behavioral norms, especially advantageous ones, can spread throughout
the system is shared by many scholars; see Kenneth N. Waltz\'s
discussion of "sameness" in Theory of International Politics (Reading,
MA: Addison-Wesley, 1979), 76 and 127. During the Cold War, the United
States played referee to a few intra-West squabbles, especially between
Greece and Turkey, and provided Hobbesian reassurance to Germany\'s
nervous neighbors. Other, equally plausible explanations exist for
stability in the first world, including the presence of a common enemy,
democracy, economic interdependence, general war aversion, etc. The
looming presence of the leviathan is certainly among these plausible
explanations, but only inside the US sphere of influence. Bipolarity was
bad for the nonaligned world, where Soviet and Western intervention
routinely exacerbated local conflicts. Unipolarity has generally been
much better, but whether or not this was due to US action is again
unclear. [Overall [US interest in the affairs of the Global South has
dropped]{.mark} markedly since the end of the Cold War, [as has the
level of violence]{.mark} in almost all regions. [There is less US
intervention in the political and military affairs of Latin
America]{.mark} compared to any time in the twentieth century, for
instance, [and also less conflict. Warfare in Africa is at an all-time
low, as is relative US interest]{.mark} outside of counterterrorism and
security assistance.66 Regional peace and stability exist where there is
US active intervention, as well as where there is not. No direct
relationship seems to exist across regions.]{.underline} If intervention
can be considered a function of direct and indirect activity, of both
political and military action, a regional picture might look like what
is outlined in Table 1. [These assessments of conflict are by necessity
relative, because there has not been a "high" level of conflict in any
region outside the Middle East during the period of the New Peace.
Putting aside for the moment that important caveat, some points become
clear. The great powers of the world are clustered in the upper right
quadrant, where US intervention has been high, but conflict levels low.
[US intervention is imperfectly correlated with stability]{.mark},
however. Indeed, [it is conceivable that the relatively high level of US
interest and activity has made the security situation in the Persian
Gulf and broader Middle East worse]{.mark}. In recent years, substantial
hard power investments (Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq), moderate
intervention (Libya), and reliance on diplomacy (Syria) have been
equally ineffective in stabilizing states torn by conflict. While it is
possible that the region is essentially unpacifiable and no amount of
police work would bring peace to its people, it remains hard to make the
case that the US presence has improved matters. In this "strong point,"
at least, [US hegemony has failed to bring peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trump and Roll-back Effect!

Trump made it very clear from the beginning that he rejects some of the
key components of the traditional foreign policy that are linked to the
current rule-based order as his presidency is based on nothing more than
nativism, isolationism, and protectionism. He is a realist, economic
nationalist, and bully, thinking the world as a zero-sum game willing to
slap punitive tariffs on imports, willing to walk away from security
commitments, ripping off "bad" deals and threatening other leaders with
its vociferating tweets and phone calls[. From the rhetorical and
empirical evidence on Trumps few weeks of deeds and achievements, it is
fair to claim that Trump would have roll-back effects on the norms,
institutions, rules, and relations that are the foundation of the
current international order]{.underline}. Trumps nativist, isolationist
and protectionist agenda could be a mix that topples the decades of old
globalist achievements. It could do that ten years ago not anymore. Even
if [Trump does what he says abandoning the US traditional role in the
international order, the order will not be redefined by the
uncertainties, on the contrary, i]{.underline}t even resists back to
Trump worldview simply because it works for them just fine!

How Far Trump Roll-Back Effect Goes as The Wheel of Power is Turning

Over the last decades, [as the [power is moving from West to
East]{.mark} and wealth is moving from North to South [the order]{.mark}
that was [built by the US]{.mark} and Western allies [in the aftermath
of the second World War]{.mark} has already started to
[shattering.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Many non-western powers rise while
the US and its buddies are in retreat]{.mark}. It is getting observable
that [the future of the world order will be shaped by other centers
rather than Washington]{.mark} or somewhere in Europe. Many see this
transition as a grand divide between western liberal and non-western
illiberal models. Indeed, the divide is real, there are challenging
world views, multiple modernities, and even development models. Yet,
this has not been any detrimental to the liberal international order,
which has been alive even revitalized over the last decades. It might
probably less American and less liberal, but the globalist agenda which
is the foundation of the order is resilient. In this sense, the
organizational logic of the order that paths through a complex
trans-governmental process for making political, military, and economic
decisions over numerous issues will survive as the today's world
requires so.]{.underline}

Only within a month since the beginning of the Trump presidency, Putin
was reportedly concluding that the era of US-Russia cooperation under
the new American President may not start anytime soon. Even that
conclusion may not last long, because Senator John McCain, a frequent
Republican critic of Trump, told the audience at the Munich Security
Conference in Germany that the Trump team was in a state of disarray. At
the very same gathering, Vice President Pence also told the NATO allies
that "they have to step up financial contributions towards defence
spending." What emerges from the preceding is that, [[at least during
its first month in office, the Trump administration is creating the
unprecedented picture of the United States as a confused superpower and
an actor willing to give up that role purely based on Trump's highly
myopic conclusion that America Firstism, as opposed to global leadership
and multilateralism, is the way to go]{.mark}.]{.underline} America's
allies are especially dismayed to receive that message while they also
know that the US congress and its security agencies strongly disagree
with that conclusion and have made it clear through their protestations
and criticism that they will not adopt America Firstism at the expense
of giving up its global leadership. Trump's bromance with Putin, his
support for Brexit, and encouragement of other European countries to
leave the EU has infuriated and befuddled a number of European leaders
so much so that a number of them "characterized the U.S. president as a
threat to the union on par with jihadist terrorism and Vladimir Putin."

[Without realizing its significance or implications, [Trump is willing
to give up America's role as the global leader]{.mark} for America
Firstism, while regaining global primacy for Russia continues to be the
chief stirring force for Vladimir Putin.]{.underline}

But President Trump's 'America First' foreign policy agenda
fundamentally calls this into question. 'For many decades', he asserted
in his inaugural address, 'we've enriched foreign industry at the
expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries
while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military...We've made
other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our
country has dissipated over the horizon'. Trump's notion of being
'ripped off' on the international stage is embodied in three major
propositions that are at the core of the administration's emergent
foreign policy: the United States' web of alliances has been
over-extended; the United States has been disadvantaged by the open
global economy; and the United States is no longer respected by either
rivals or friends. [[The administration]{.mark}'s responses to each of
these issues look [set to weaken]{.mark} rather than strengthen
[American primacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [[Trump's]{.mark}
repeated [questioning of the utility of U.S. alliances, and threats to
withdraw]{.mark} American [security guarantees]{.mark} if its partners
fail to bear a greater proportion of the financial burden are
counter-productive. Such posturing arguably [weakens American
credibility]{.mark} with both friends and rivals, [encouraging friends
to look toward greater self-reliance]{.mark}---including band-wagoning
with other great powers---[and providing opportunities for rivals to
become more strategically assertive.]{.mark}]{.underline} Second, [the
administration's response to the challenges of the open global economic
order, including threats to slap high tariffs on imports and pursue a
'trade war' against China, are a throwback to the mercantilist
protectionism of the 19th century]{.underline}. The viability of such a
retreat behind a 'tariff wall' however is not only highly questionable
given the nature of the contemporary international economic system but
also likely to have adverse geo-strategic consequences. As President Xi
Jinping demonstrated at the recent World Economic Forum summit, the
opportunities presented by such an abdication of American global
economic leadership is one that is unlikely to be passed up in Beijing.
[The Trump administration's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) provides Beijing with an enormous opportunity to embed
itself as the economic linchpin in the Asia-Pacific through its
ambitious 'One Belt, One Road' (OBOR) strategy. OBOR's
infrastructure-heavy endeavour to enhance Eurasian economic
'connectivity' is also to be supported by Beijin]{.underline}g-led
multilateral institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure and
Investment Bank (AIIB) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership
(RCEP) which, as Mark Beeson notes, have peaked the interests of 'many
of the US's most reliable and trusted allies'. Third, [[the President's
claim that putting its 'own interests first' is critical to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [winning back the respect of other
nations is predicated on a zero-sum view of
i]{.mark}nte[r]{.mark}national politics [where there are only winners
and losers.]{.mark} This transactional approach has been apparent in
Trump's utterances on various issues from how to combat Islamic State
('bomb the shit outta them and take their oil') to NATO ('We are paying
disproportionately') to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement ('we're giving
them billions of dollars in this deal').]{.underline} President Trump
has promised the American people that he will make the United States
'wealthy', 'proud', 'safe' and 'great again'. Yet it's difficult to see
how a foreign policy such as this will help achieve these goals. Rather,
[[the administration appears to be in the process of abdicating
America's leadership role in international affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In its absence, that opens up space for others to rewrite the 'rules of
the game'. They are unlikely to be as favourable to the US or its
allies.

#### Saudi-American alliance is key to counter Iran and terrorists in addition to keeping global oil markets stable

security partner in the Middle East,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-american-security-partner-in-the-middle-east

Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten **[that our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most important
single security partner]{.underline}**. [Israel's security is certainly
a key American concern, but it does not play an active role in most of
America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with
Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS
and Al Qaeda]{.underline}. [Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner
has also been enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on
their own internal stability and their roles in the region have sharply
diminished, and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major instability
problems and are at war. Our European allies have declining power
projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the region is increasingly
problematic]{.underline}. It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs
the United States as much or more than the United States needs Saudi
Arabia. **[Saudi military forces are steadily improving, but it is the
U.S. presence in the region that create a balance of forces that firmly
deters Iran and has helped Saudi Arabia defeat its own terrorist threats
from groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. U.S. arms shipments,
advisory efforts and exercises also play a critical role in improving
Saudi forces]{.underline}**. But the United States needs Saudi Arabia as
well. [Saudi Arabia is now the most critical single security partner in
ensuring the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf
region.]{.underline} **[While the United States is largely eliminating
its need for direct petroleum imports, it is steadily increasing its
dependence on the health and growth of the global economy and imports
from Asian states like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are
critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports]{.underline}**. The end
result is that U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to
increase in spite of the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports. [This is
why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi
investment in the United States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia
has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to
cooperate in checking Iran, and **treating the war in Yemen as is if
Saudi Arabia does not face real threats is not the way the United States
should deal with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the White
House**]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia's reform and economic development
plans are critical to its stability and the region's security. The
kingdom needs U.S. encouragement and an understanding that Saudi Arabia
cannot implement these plans effectively without outside support. The
burden sharing argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be
treated as a source of ready money every time the United States has a
need. It is already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on
security, which is three times the economic burden security places on
the United States. This spending is too high given the kingdom's other
needs, and the United States should be focusing on better ways to make
its security partnerships with Saudi Arabia, as well as the other Gulf
states and Jordan more efficient and less costly, not simply on spending
more. At the same time**[, Iran is all too real a threat]{.underline}**.
**[Effective joint action in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs, its
ballistic and cruise missile programs, its asymmetric threats to Gulf
shipping, and expending military influence in the region are all
critical common U.S. and Saudi priorities]{.underline}**. [The United
States also badly needs to find some common approach to dealing with
Iraq and Syria that will move both towards recovery and lasting
stability, limit Iranian and Russian influence as much as possible, and
help stabilize relations with Turkey]{.underline}. There are no easy
options in either case, but [Saudi Arabia is the key potential Arab
partner any such efforts.]{.underline} The United States, especially
members of Congress, needs to remember that we have had at least as many
military problems in fighting the Iraq and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates have faced in fighting in Yemen. **[Cutting
U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may do little more that lead the
Saudis to ignore the systems that the United States has helped set up to
limit targeting of civilians and using unguided and more damaging air
munitions]{.underline}**. [It raises a whole new round of questions
about the U.S commitment to its partners in the region]{.underline}. [We
need to forge a common solution in Yemen, not a decoupling that leaves
Saudi Arabia exposed]{.underline}. This would fail in both military and
human rights terms, and leaves both the United States and Saudi Arabia
with no options for dealing with the Houthi or Iran, seeking ways to end
the war, dealing with Al Qaida or the other terrorist movements in
Yemen, and without any means to help Yemen back to some form of
stability and development. These challenges are also are reasons why the
United States should do as much as possible to persuade Mohammed Bin
Salman to end the divisions that have led Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates to split with Qatar, and to rising tensions with Oman.
[More unity between the southern Gulf states in dealing with Iran and
terrorism can do far more to help the United states than more arms
sales]{.underline}. [Finally, more interoperability, common facilities
and cooperation are key to countering Iran. We need to take this visit
seriously, and stop focusing on pomp and deals.]{.underline} The United
States is highly unlikely to find a better Saudi leader for reform and
change in Saudi Arabia during the next decade, or one more committed to
improving Saudi security in ways that serve the common interests of both
the United States and Saudi Arabia.

#### The US Saudi relationship is built on mutual security interests

Arabia,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/334488-trump-gets-it-right-in-saudi-arabia

For all the sound and fury over his public remarks and tweets in
Washington, President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia has been a very
different story. The president gave the right speech in the right place
at the right time. [There will still be critics on issues like human
rights and Yemen, but the president had a different focus --- and almost
certainly the right one. First, he needed to reassure the Saudis, the
leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and the other leaders of
the 50 some Islamic countries meeting in the Kingdom that he was not
anti-Islamic and did not see Islam as an enem]{.underline}y. He did just
that --- and in ways far more suited to the culture of his audience than
the take-no-prisoners rhetoric he often employs in the U.S. The first
three paragraphs of his
[speech](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/334454-full-speech-president-donald-trump-address-in-saudi)
thanked his hosts, and talked about "the splendor of your country and
the kindness of your citizens." He mentioned the meeting between
President Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz, and then went on to "extend my
deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished
heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us
with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to
yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both
your people and mine." He then went on to say that he stood before them
"as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of
friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit
a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as
custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith." Courtesy and
respect don't make headlines, but they do make friends and strategic
partners. They are particularly critical in the Arab world, and
particularly important when the speaker sometimes treated all of Islam
as an enemy during his campaign and implied that Islam itself might be
hostile and extremist. [The president then went on to make it clear that
America's search for strategic partners meant strengthening America's
oldest friendships, which include several Arab states.]{.underline} He
promised that "[America will not seek to impose our way of life on
others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and
trust \... Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of
stamping out extremism]{.underline} and providing our children a hopeful
future that does honor to God." He then stated his respect for Arab
history and culture, the need for economic progress, and noted that
"Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world's great
faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to
Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders,
this country is also home to modern ones --- including soaring
achievements in architecture." [He mentioned the positive character of
one strategic partner after another --- reinforcing the importance of
the U.S. strategic partnership with that country in the
process.]{.underline} When it came to the core of his speech --- the
fight against terrorism --- the president's choice in words really
mattered. He avoided phrases like "Islamic extremism," but repeatedly
made it clear that the U.S. would focus on the threats posed by
"terrorists and extremists." He carefully avoided the financial aspects
of burden sharing --- something all too necessary in a Saudi Arabia
spending something like three times the percent of its GDP on defense as
the U.S. and nearly six times the percentage of the average NATO ally.
But, he was perfectly clear about what he expected from the countries
present when he said, "There can be no coexistence with this violence.
There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no
ignoring it \... America is prepared to stand with you in pursuit of
shared interests and common security \... But the nations of the Middle
East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The
nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they
want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children." He
went on and said, "A better future is only possible if your nations
drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive them out. Drive them of
your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them
out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth \... That means
honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist
terror groups it inspires \... It means standing together against the
murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of
Jews, and the slaughter of Christians \... . Religious leaders must make
this absolutely clear \... And political leaders must speak out to
affirm the same idea: heroes don't kill innocents. They save them."
These are strong messages, but they are also ones that resonate
throughout the Islamic world, and for the reasons the president also
stated in his speech, "The deadliest toll has been exacted on the
innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have
borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this
wave of fanatical violence \... Some estimates hold that more than 95
percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim." He pointed
to "a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is
spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions \...
The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others,
must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted
in generations of vanished dreams." These are words that the vast
majority of Muslims agree with, and ones that clearly rise above fear,
prejudice, and isolationism. They are the values Muslims want in a
strategic partner. They do not compromise any aspect of the fight
against extremism and terrorism. [President Trump was also careful to
emphasize the threat from the Iranian government as another core aspect
of the U.S. strategic partnership with the Arab world]{.underline}, but
he also focused on the Iranian government and not the Iranian people,
many of whom clearly do not support its extremism. He called Iran "a
government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of
Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this
room \... Among Iran's most tragic and destabilizing interventions have
been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable
crimes." [Many press reports will focus on some \$110 billion in arms
sales, and the fact that the president not only implied the U.S. would
back away from efforts to change Saudi Arabia, but would remain
committed to Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey, and a successful outcome in
Yemen]{.underline}. The president also touched on trade and investment,
and Saudi Arabia's 2030 plan for reform. At the same time, he did not
dodge the issue of Israel and the need for broad religious tolerance. He
said, "For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians,
Muslims and Jews living side-by-side. We must practice tolerance and
respect for each other once again, and make this region a place where
every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a
life of dignity and hope \... If these three faiths can join together in
cooperation, then peace in this world is possible, including peace
between Israelis and Palestinians." One speech cannot change Arab or
Muslim perceptions of the president or the U.S. as an ally. Much will
depend on the years and actions that follow. Words really matter,
however, and especially in the Middle East. This time, the president
used the right words to start rebuilding the foundations of America's
strategic partnerships in the Muslim world and Middle East, and to deal
with truly urgent threats. This speech is the right beginning --- in
remarkably well-crafted terms --- and it deserves bipartisan and expert
respect.

in foreign military sales slated for approval to Saudi Arabia over the
next ten years]{.underline}---and the Trump administration's recent
attempt to reset bilateral relations with the country---[it wouldn't be
rash to think that this value is significant. The US-Saudi reset comes
at a time when the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen against
Iranian-backed militants enters its second year, and as Iran grows
bolder in expanding its presence throughout the region]{.underline}.
**[The United States has, to date, nearly \$100 billion in active

that have posed a threat to US Special Forces operators and the Sunni
Arab rebels they trained. That President Donald Trump has made Riyadh,
the capital of Saudi Arabia, his first stop on his international tour
speaks volumes. A major impetus for this decision seems to have been the
March visit to Washington by Saudi Deputy Crown Prince (and son of the
king) Mohammad bin Salman. Many insiders have viewed the trip as a
[success](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-usa-idUSKBN16L2CT);
the comparatively pragmatic future king discussed not only enhancing
counterterrorism and defense cooperation with the United States, but
also significantly increasing Saudi

in the United States, as well as paving the way for more American
companies to do business in the kingdom. All of this speaks to an
important question: **[Could increasing defense cooperation with Saudi
Arabia actually be a good thing for security in the
region?]{.underline}** While in Riyadh, Trump participated in a
[50-nation
summit](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/5/10/arab-islamic-summit-with-trump-saudi-sends-invites)
involving majority-Muslim countries. Topics like countering extremism
and Iranian malign interference in regional affairs took crowning
positions in the conversation. This in itself was a positive step, and
it went a long way to counter the toxic narrative that the United States
is engaged in an ostensible war against the world's one billion-plus
Muslim population. The commitment by the Arab and Muslim states at the
Riyadh Summit [to establish a counter extremism center and a reserve
force of over 30,000
soldiers](https://english.aawsat.com/asharq-al-awsat-english/news-middle-east/saudi-arabia/riyadh-declaration-cements-arab-islamic-us-partnership-facing-terrorism-iran)
to combat extremists could---if matched with real resources---serve as a
way to share the burden in the fluid, asymmetric fight against a variety
of sub-state extremist groups. This convergence of national security
interests between the United States and Saudi Arabia was spelled out by
National Security Advisor Lt. Gen McMaster a couple of weeks ago. He
[said](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-arter/national-security-adviser-hr-mcmaster-details-trumps-first-trip-abroad)
that **[a main thrust for Trump's visit was to "encourage our Arab and
Muslim partners to take bold, new steps to promote peace and to confront
those, from ISIS to al Qaeda to Iran to the Assad regime, who perpetuate
chaos and violence that has inflicted so much suffering throughout the
Muslim world and beyond]{.underline}**." Here, [the subtext was that the
United States and the Muslim world share common adversaries and threats
to their]{.underline} security. Also interesting was his declaration
that Iran and the Assad regime are destabilizing forces on par with al
Qaeda and the Islamic State. If there's ever been a clearer break from
the Obama-era [foreign
policy](https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2016/03/the-obama-doctrine-the-atlantics-exclusive-report-on-presidents-hardest-foreign-policy-decisions/473151/)
around the Middle East---which almost exclusively invested in the
Iranian nuclear deal and viewed Saudi Arabia with cordial yet cold
detachment---this was it. [Much of the munitions that the United States
is selling to Saudi Arabia will likely be used in the battle field in
Yemen, a country of considerable geopolitical importance]{.underline}.
American interests in Yemen have so far been limited to drone warfare
and the occasional special forces raid against al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula. **[But the recent increase of extremist activity in Yemen
offers a new policy dimension that requires closer US coordination with
Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}** The domestic economic benefits are notable.
Some 800,000 jobs associated with the United States' domestic defense
industry are heavily dependent on foreign military sales; by some
[estimates](http://www.clearedconnections.com/security-clearance-news/security-clearance/defense-jobs-make-up-10-percent-of-u-s-manufacturing-demand.htm),
10 percent of US manufacturing demand is linked to major defense
conglomerates. Some US lawmakers have [voiced
opposition](http://rare.us/rare-politics/issues/foreign-policy/rand-paul-the-u-s-should-not-fund-saudi-arabias-war-on-yemen/)
to what they fear will become American entanglement in Yemen's complex
political environment. Indeed, [a political solution to the Yemen
conflict was
[rejected](http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/07/31/477830/Yemen-Houthis-UN-peace-plan)
by the Iranian-backed militias on two separate occasions, and reports of
[famine](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/mar/16/yemen-conflict-7-million-close-to-famine)
in some cities and the countryside are increasing]{.underline}. However,
typically, the only major factor in Congressional approval for massive
military sales to a foreign country centers on whether exported weapon
systems would threaten Israel's qualitative military edge. To that
point, the Israelis have [voiced no
objections](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/05/congress-saudi-missile-defense-sale-thaad-israel-gulf-ties.html)
to Saudi weapon sales---and in fact may be encouraging them, given the
increased convergence of security worries posed by Iran. Military sales
also include a package deal of maintenance, spare parts, and due
diligence, and the military sales agreement commits the Saudi government
to ensuring that military equipment is utilized solely by the Saudi
military---and not repackaged or resold to other states or destabilizing
groups. The United States will likely be inextricably linked to Saudi
Arabia for the foreseeable future on both the economic and security
fronts. **[As the fight against the Islamic State progresses, and as al
Qaeda loses ground, it'd be unwise, and unsafe, for the United States to
ignore the rising threat posed by Iranian-backed militant
groups---especially when empowering Saudi Arabia with the necessary
tools to confront mounting political threats could well be a net benefit
all around.]{.underline}**

According to sources in the top management in defense enterprises,
Russia is preparing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia; the demand is due to
the current conflicts in the Middle East. **[Saudi Arabia has long
relied on purchases of arms from NATO countries and the
US.]{.underline}** **[Now it has expressed interest in Russian missile
boats, patrol ships near the sea area, medium landing ships and patrol
ships.]{.underline}** There are other serious developments as well,
sources say. The **[Saudis are allegedly negotiating the acquisition of

for the next visit of Saudi King Salman, **[the Russian Federation is
expected to prepare a package proposal for about \$10
billion.]{.underline}** This proposal will provide for the supply of
aircraft and munitions as well as several types of defense systems of
various ranges. In addition, in 2016 Russia will concentrate on
supplying arms to countries in the Asia-Pacific region (Indonesia,
Malaysia) and the financially strong countries of Africa (Angola,
Uganda). According to a senior source in the government, even if some of
the negotiations fail, the arms exports are expected to yield about
\$14-\$15 billion in 2016. During the last meeting of the Commission on
Military-Technical Cooperation with foreign countries, held in late
October 2015, Vladimir Putin said that the portfolio of orders of the
enterprises of the Russian defense industry exceeds \$50 billion. He
called for even more active promotion of their products in regional
markets. According to the Federal Service for Military-technical
Cooperation, over the last 11 years exports of Russian arms have grown
threefold, from about \$5 billion to \$15.3 billion. However, despite an
impressive list of 60 countries with which Russia has solid contracts
the main profit comes from five or six major players. The results of
2015 have not yet been officially presented. It is known that as of
December 1st, the profit from military products supplied abroad was
\$11.6 billion and the portfolio had expanded to \$57 billion. In early
November 2015, Sergey Chemezov, the Head of the State Corporation
\"Rostec" said that \"Rosoboronexport\" was ahead of schedule in
supplying arms to foreign countries. \"The plans for this year are 12.8
billion dollars. But we redoubled these plans," Chemezov said.

(CNN) - A number of countries have restricted arms sales to Saudi Arabia
since the kingdom began airstrikes on Yemen in 2015, in a war that the
UN describes as the world\'s worst man-made humanitarian disaster. Calls
for more restrictions on arms exports have been growing, particularly in
Europe, since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi
consulate in Turkey last month. US President Donald Trump, however, has
repeatedly pointed to the US\' lucrative arms deals with the Saudis as a
reason to stand by the kingdom. Denmark and Finland on Thursday became
the latest countries to suspend new arms deals with Saudi Arabia.
Denmark\'s Foreign Ministry said it was freezing new deals over both
Khashoggi and Yemen, while the Finnish Foreign Ministry mentioned only
Yemen. Finland also banned new arms sales to the United Arab Emirates,
which is part of the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict. Their
announcements came just two days after Germany said it was stopping all
arms transfers to the kingdom. Denmark and Finland are not major
suppliers of weapons to Saudi Arabia, but Germany certainly is. It had
already suspended new arms deals to Saudi Arabia, but on Monday it
widened that ban to include the transfers of weapons on existing orders
as well. So where is Saudi Arabia getting its weapons from? Arms deals
are often done in secret or with little publicity. **[The Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) tries to track deals
involving major weapons, mmmand a database of Saudi imports from the
last decade shows the United States as the biggest supplier, followed by
the United Kingdom, France, Spain and then Germany.]{.underline}** But a
lot of exporters still selling to the Saudis have dramatically decreased
their supply in recent years. The United Kingdom, for example,
transferred arms worth an estimated \$843 million in 2016 but almost
halved that value to \$436 million last year, according to SIPRI. (The
database uses values constant with 1990 prices to eliminate currency
fluctuations and inflation.) French exports of major weapons to Saudi
Arabia were worth \$174 million in 2015 but dropped to \$91 million in
2016 and \$27 million last year. The value of Spanish exports also
dramatically decreased in that time period, but the Spanish government
confirmed this year it would go ahead with arms deals it had previously
suggested it would freeze, bowing to pressure from Spanish
manufacturers, according to reports. US dwarfs other exporters Despite
these decreases, the overall value of Saudi weapons imports actually
increased by 38% between 2016 and 2017. That was almost entirely because
of a huge uptick in transfers from the United States, which almost
doubled its exports in terms of value from \$1.8 billion to \$3.4
billion in that time. Germany also multiplied its exports from \$14
million to \$105 million, although it is expected to be much lower this
year following its suspension. Overall, no country comes close to the
United States in major weapons supply. Over the past five years, for
example, the US accounted for 61% of major arms sales to the Saudis. The
UK was a distant second, with a 23% share, while France, in third place,
was a mere 4%. In a statement on Tuesday, Trump said that canceling
major arms contracts with the Saudis would be foolish, and that \"Russia
and China would be the enormous beneficiaries\" if the US halted its
sales. China supplies a negligible amount of major weaponry to Saudi
Arabia, SIPRI data shows, but it is on the increase. Russia supplies so
little it is not included in the organization\'s database. \"Russia has
tried hard in the past 10 to 15 years to get into the large Saudi arms
market, but it has not been very successful. Saudi Arabia has acquired
Russian rifles and may have bought some other items, but such deahls
have been very small,\" said Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher with
SIPRI\'s arms transfers and military expenditure program. \"China has
made some more substantial inroads into the Saudi arms market, in
particular selling armed drones,\" Wezeman said. \"The details are shady
and we may very well have underestimated China\'s role as an arms
exporter to Saudi Arabia. But China doesn\'t come anywhere near the USA,
UK or even France as arms suppliers. Still, the important point here is
that **[Saudi Arabia has explored the possibility of diversifying its
supplier base.\"]{.underline}**

[[China]{.mark} has [struck a]{.mark} surprise [deal to manufacture
military drones at a factory in Saudi Arabia]{.mark}. It forms part of a
suite of agreements totalling \$60bn agreed during King Salman\'s visit
to the country last month that will also see the two countries develop
oil refineries and co-operate on China's Chang E-4 moon
mission.]{.underline} The deal comes as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf
neighbours continue an unprecedented rush for arms to cope with what
they see as a number of counter-terrorism threats across the region.
Meanwhile, long-standing ally[, the United States shows no sign of
granting those countries access to its own military drone technology.
\"For a long time, China and Islamic countries have respected each other
and had win-win cooperation, and have created a model of the peaceful
coexistence of different cultures,\"]{.underline} Xi said, according to
China\'s Foreign Ministry. The factory, China's first in the Middle
East, will produce state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology
Corporation\'s (CASC) CH-4 Caihong, or \"Rainbow\" drone as well as
associated equipment, which would improve after-sales services for
clients in the Middle East. China plugs arms gap left by US The
conflicts in Syria and Yemen and the rise of the Islamic State (IS)
group have led countries in the region to increase their arms imports by
86 percent over the past five years, accounting for 29 percent of global
imports, according to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute. [Saudia
Arabia has become the world\'s second-largest arms importer, yet the
United States, its closest ally and main exporter of arms, refuses to
sell its Predator and Reaper drones, which go only to a small number of
European nations.]{.underline} The Saudis also felt incensed when last
December then-US President Barack Obama blocked an arms shipment to
Saudi Arabia after concerns were raised in Congress over civilian
casualties in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is despite the US waging
a controversial drone campaign to take out what it sees as suspected
al-Qaeda targets in Yemen for more than a decade. [[Saudi has]{.mark}
since [turned to China, which]{.mark} unlike the US, is not signatory to
the international Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and so [has fewer restrictions
on the sale of drone technology]{.mark}. [Chinese drones are cheaper
too.]{.mark} The CH-4 costs \$4m while [a low-end Chinese drone can cost
about \$1m]{.mark}. On the other hand, American Reaper drones can cost
in excess of \$17m.]{.underline} Added to this a slump in world oil
prices and it\'s easier to see why the CH-4 has become the killer drone
of choice for countries across the Middle East. "The CH-4 has recorded
outstanding performance in anti-terrorist attacks in Iraq, Yemen, as
well as in Africa's Sudan, Ethiopia and China's neighbouring Pakistan,"
Zhou Chenming, who previously worked for CASC's drone-development
subsidiary, told the South China Post newspaper. "That's why our Saudi
friends are so interested in the drone cooperation project," he added.
[[It is believed that Saudi Arabia]{.mark} and UAE have [used it for
airstrikes in Yemen]{.mark}. Last year the Iraqi defence ministry
released a video of a CH-4 strike on a car belonging to alleged IS
fighters in Iraq.]{.underline} The CH-4 has a range of about 3,500km and
can carry the AR-1 precision-guided missile that can hit a distant
target with a margin of error of less than 1.5 metres. At the launch
last month of a report assessing the military and defence capabilities
of countries around the world, John Chipman, director of the
International Institute of Strategic Studies, was cited by AFP as saying
that \"an emerging threat for deployed Western forces is that with China
looking to sell more abroad, they may confront more advanced military
systems, in more places, and operated by a broader range of
adversaries.\" The report found that in terms of air power, \"China
appears to be reaching near-parity with the West\". China\'s growing
role in Middle East Despite Chinese arms accounting for less than one
percent of Saudi Arabian arms imports, arms deals were central to the
formalising of Saudi Arabian-Chinese relations. In 1988, China sold
\$3.5bn worth of state-of-the-art nuclear-capable ballistic missiles to
Saudi Arabia, and two years later the oil-rich kingdom cut-off
diplomatic ties with Taiwan and formally recognised Beijing. Despite its
reliance on the region for oil, China has traditionally played little
part in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy. This has begun to change,
with China trying to get more involved in efforts to end Syria\'s
six-year-old civil war, where Riyadh supports rebels fighting President
Bashar al-Assad. China has also offered support for Yemen's embattled
government, which is backed by a Saudi-led Gulf Arab coalition in a war
against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement. But China will be mindful
to tread a careful line as it also enjoys a close relationship with
Iran. One Beijing-based diplomat from a Muslim-majority country told
Reuters that China was trying to play the role of "honest broker" in the
Middle East, as it lacks the historical baggage of the Americans or
Europeans.

##   China Nuclear War

#### The Rising Power(china) will try to gain hegemony, but this will result in a war.

Graham **Allison, 24-09-2015**, \"The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and
China Headed for War?,\" Atlantic,
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/

**[The defining question about global order for this generation is
whether China and the United States can escape Thucydides's Trap.
The [Greek historian's
metaphor](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.1.first.html) reminds
us of the]{.underline}** attendant **[dangers when a rising power rivals
a ruling power---as Athens challenged Sparta in ancient Greece, or as
Germany did Britain a century ago. Most such contests have ended badly,
often for both nations, a team]{.underline}** of mine **[at the Harvard
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs has concluded
after [analyzing the historical
record](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/25760/thucydides_trap_project.html).]{.underline}**
In 12 of 16 cases over the past 500 years, the result was war. When the
parties avoided war, it required huge, painful adjustments in attitudes
and actions on the part not just of the challenger but also the
challenged. **[Based on the current trajectory, war between the United
States and China in the decades ahead is not just possible, but much
more likely than recognized at the moment. Indeed, judging by the
historical record, war is more likely]{.underline}** than not. Moreover,
current underestimations and misapprehensions of the hazards inherent in
the U.S.-China relationship contribute greatly to those hazards. A risk
associated with Thucydides's Trap is that business as usual---not just
an unexpected, extraordinary event---can trigger large-scale conflict.
**[When a rising power is threatening to displace a ruling power,
standard crises that would otherwise be contained, like the
assassination of an archduke in 1914, can initiate a cascade of
reactions that, in turn, produce outcomes none of the parties would
otherwise have chosen. However unimaginable conflict seems, however
catastrophic the potential consequences for all actors, however deep the
cultural empathy among leaders, even blood relatives, and however
economically interdependent states may be---none of these factors is
sufficient to prevent war, in 1914 or today.]{.underline}**

#### The rising powers will present the US with a choice---it's a choice between war or peace. 

Asle Toje, 2016, "Will China's Rise Be Peaceful?" Oxford University

Over time, however, **[the relative power of states changes, and
eventually the international order no longer reflects that actual
distribution of power between the great powers. When that happens, the
legitimacy of the prevailing power is put into question.]{.underline}**

threatened tariffs on all Chinese imports to the United States, while
Chinese policy-makers have floated the idea of differential tariffs on
U.S. imports, targeting those American goods that China can easily

tit-for-tat actions escalate, the stakes are rising
exponentially.]{.underline}** It all began with Trump's focus on the
large U.S. deficit in bilateral trade with China. Then the
administration's Section 301 trade investigation pinpointed unequal
market access and Chinese industrial policy practices that aim to
catch-up technologically, especially the Made in China 2025 program.
Now, Trump seems hell-bent on conducting a full-scale trade war with
far-reaching repercussions. While no longer part of the Trump
administration, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to the president, tends
to reflect the administration's hard-line views on trade. He [recently
argued](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165185/trump-wont-back-down-us-president-plans-make-trade-war)
that U.S. strategy was to make the trade war "unbearably painful" for

expanding contest for economic dominance.]{.underline}** While American
politicians on both sides of the aisle do not necessarily support
Trump's tariffs, they agree on the strategic objective of containing
China's rise and preserving U.S. global dominance. Accordingly, the
Trump administration is presenting the battle over trade as the opening
skirmish in an economic cold war. China has similarly started to see the
trade war in a structural light: an attempt by the United States to
contain China's development, especially its efforts to foster indigenous
Chinese technologies that could one day rival those of the United
States.

"it's clear that was the subtext," Mohammed Ayoob, a senior fellow at

accusing the Islamic Republic of terrorism and identifying it, alongside

Last week, Iran shot down a U.S. military drone - RQ-4A Global Hawk,
which it claimed was flying over Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf
region. U.S. officials, however, said the incident took place in
international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz, an important shipping
route. A day later, **[[Trump said he had called off a retaliatory
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}** against three sites in Iran in the last
minute because it wouldn\'t be a \"proportionate\" response. The
dangerous turn of events has rekindled the debate of whether the U.S.
and Iran would go for war and what will be its possible repercussions
for the region. Prof. Sayed Mohammad Marandi, an Iranian academic and
political analyst who was part of the nuclear deal negotiations in 2015,
sees a U.S.-Iran military confrontation unlikely. \"[[What is preventing
the U.S. from]{.mark} moving from economic warfare to [open military

Sadrodin Moosvi, managing director of Iran\'s state-run Iran Daily
newspaper, sees the downing of the U.S. military drone an indicator of
Iran\'s sophisticated military capabilities. \"[It shows that [there are
many U.S. and regional targets that are vulnerable and within Iran\'s
reach]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he told Anadolu Agency. While tensions are
running high, regional observers believe that Washington will not be
able to launch a new war in the West Asian region. Last month, the U.S.
military announced that it had deployed Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier
for a probable war with Iran in the Persian Gulf. \"After several weeks
of power show, the carrier was withdrawn as there was no change in the
position of the Iranian government towards the U.S.,\" Syed Sajjad, a
Middle East researcher, said. Marwa Osman, a journalist and political
observer specializing on Middle East affairs, said the option of [[war
does not have the support of the majority of Americans, and in case of
war Iran would strike back hard]{.underline}]{.mark}. \"The message from
Tehran to the White House is clear: Iran will not succumb to threats and
pressures, and is ready to confront even if it is an all-out war,\"
Osman told Anadolu Agency. \"Its position vis-a-vis the United States is
based on two central factors: a clear strategy and the will to fight in
defense of its national sovereignty and vital interests,\" she said.
Osman said regional and international leaders will have to work towards
de-escalation between Iran and the U.S. because everyone will be
affected in the event of a war.

al-Joumhouria newspaper, [s[aid such a war would be fought on many
fronts, not just one, meaning losses would be countl]{.mark}ess. "At the
regional level, we see as unlikely an American war against Iran for many
reasons, the most important of them being firstly that Iran is a strong
state with important defensive capabilities," Qassem said. [Trump "does
not benefit from a war that he can start but whose results he cannot
control and which might begin with Iran but may be accompanied by the
region being set on fire]{.mark}]{.underline}", he said. Hezbollah is a
heavily armed group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 that
has fought more recently in regional conflicts including Syria and Iraq
as part of a Tehran-backed alliance. Qassem noted what he described as
"the great accomplishments" of the alliance led by Iran over the last
two decades in "Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere".
The United States views Hezbollah as a terrorist group. On Wednesday,
Trump said any war between Iran and the United States would be swift,
but reiterated his desire to avoid a military confrontation even while
blasting Tehran's leaders. The United States has imposed crippling
financial sanctions against Iran since last year when Trump withdrew
from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers under which Iran curbed
its nuclear program. Tension has escalated sharply since last month when
the Trump administration tightened its sanctions noose, ordering all
countries to halt purchases of Iranian oil.

Obviously, this is so the White House can ensure there are no

This was perceived as being part and parcel of an intense lobbying
effort by GCC powers intent on squaring off against Iran, and the
evidence of that came not long after when Riyadh and its allies
blockaded fellow GCC member Qatar who they deemed to be too close to
both Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. [With hawks such as John Bolton in

crimes against predominantly Sunni Arabs but also Shia personalities who

purposes. It also instigated the botched Saudi intervention in Yemen by
[arming the Shia Houthis to the

and encouraging them to carve up the ill-fated country. Iran is as much
if not more, to blame than anyone else. But [the Saudis have
miscalculated and misread their American ally's appetite for war. Trump

Domestically, [the American people have no desire to see yet another
Iraq]{.underline} (or perhaps worse), [and no amount of Gulf Arab money
or Israeli lobbying can change that. If the Saudis and the Emiratis want
a war with Iran, they had either better pray for Saddam Hussein to be
resurrected]{.underline} and to initiate a second Iran-Iraq War -- a war
that was successful in containing Iranian expansionism, despite the
enormous cost -- [or they had better be prepared to fight their own
battles. Should Riyadh and Abu Dhabi decide to go to war against Iran, I
have no doubt the US would fully support them with arms]{.underline},
training and intelligence capabilities. [However, American help will
come at a significant cost, and it will be in their interest to drag the
war out much as they did during the Iran-Iraq War.]{.underline} However,
this is most unlikely to happen, as Saudi strategists are fully aware
that the result of any Gulf Arab military action against Iran would
result in a resounding defeat for them. Iran's conventional capabilities
may be less technically advanced, but they are better trained on the
equipment they do have. Iran fought an eight-year conventional war
against Iraq and routinely deploys its men on missions abroad,
particularly in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, giving them an experience edge
over the soft and untested Arab armies. Iran is also capable of striking
many of these wealthy Arab cities with ballistic missiles as well as
disrupting their export of energy, dealing a crippling blow to their
economies. Finally, Iran's proxies are all over the region and can be
activated at any moment. If the Saudis cannot defeat the Houthis, they
stand little chance of being able to deal with the better armed and
trained militants right over their northern border in Iraq. In addition
to both US Secretary of State [Mike
Pompeo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48272208) and
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei both recently stating that they [do not
anticipate going to
war](https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Khamenei-There-will-not-be-any-war-with-the-US-589684)
against each other, all of this shows how Trump's policy of bluster but
little action will not result in sustained military action - but it is
likely an attempt to force the Iranians back to the negotiating table.
If that is the result of all this, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are likely
to be left sorely disappointed.

#### No previous nuclear escalation with Iran -- Even during times of stress, Iran shows MAJOR cooperation

**The hans India 16** US, Iran set historic deal in motion null \| 25

**[Until last year, it was unimaginable that there would be a peaceful
solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis]{.underline}**. Tehran's nuclear
deal once again caught the headlines when last weekend followed by the
IAEA's confirmation, the nuclear sanctions on it were removed, signaling
Iran's reintegration with the global economy. It was indeed a remarkable
moment in international diplomacy because **[the nuclear tangle finally
got resolved without any military faceoff]{.underline}**. Even when a
deal had been reached in July 2015, in Vienna (between Iran and P5+1,
and the European Union), critics continued to attack the efforts,
questioning the operating challenges of the accord and Iran's dubious
nuclear record. Also Read - TN NEET row: Centre turns down Tamil Nadu,

proving its critics wrong, Tehran acted quickly to rein in its nuclear
programme. It decommissioned its enrichment centrifuges, removed the
core of its heavy-water reactor and shipped out most of its low-enriched
uranium stockpile. As **[Iran cooperated with the world]{.underline}**,
the negotiating parties also seemed to reciprocate at an equal pace to
remove all the sanctions within hours. Also Read - NEP must strengthen
25% provision for poor children to realize \'Sabka Saath,Sabka Vikas &
Sabka Vishwas\' Advertise With Us The implementation of the deal is
indeed 'historic' and 'momentous' because of a number of reasons. First,
it demonstrated the willingness of both the US and Iran to move past
their history of hostilities and begin a new future of cooperation. Both
President Barack Obama and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani
deserve credit for their visionary determination and sticking to the
path of diplomacy which brought new hope to a region that was otherwise
tormented by conflicts. Advertise With Us The removal of restrictions on
Iran's oil, petrochemicals, banking, natural gas and port sectors will
hugely benefit Tehran and allow it to re-enter the global market. As an
instant relief, it will also be able to access the huge amount of cash
it has accumulated overseas from restricted oil sales during the
sanctions. This deal is stated to bring rich dividends for New Delhi.
For years, India depended on Iran as a key supplier of energy, but
international sanctions limited its trade and motivated New Delhi to get
supplies from other countries in the Gulf. With the prospect of some
sanctions being lifted soon, India is looking to renew that energy
trade. India has taken steps to invest in Iran's southern port of
Chabahar. Expanding trade through this port would help create a link for
India directly into Afghan and Central Asian markets without having to
worry about neighboring Pakistan. This route could become an alternative
to the regional hub at the Gwadar port in Pakistan, where China has made
major investments. These openings could have major geostrategic
implications. A lot of positive things have been said and written about
the improving US-Iran ties. **[Though both sides maintain that
cooperation is limited to the nuclear deal, in actuality it is much
broader]{.underline}**. Tehran and Washington are engaged in Syria and
Iraq. They share common interests in Afghanistan. The quick release of
American sailors whose patrol boats drifted into Iranian waters signaled
the shift in ties. Even though developments are appearing to be bright,
the Obama administration faces the uphill task of keeping the
anti-Tehran allies in West Asia such as Saudi Arabia and Israel happy
and countering domestic criticism by the Republicans that it is going
soft on Iran. But the US administration has played down these fears and
insisted that the deal is only about stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions.
But the question arises how far this deal is sustainable and what
effects they can have on the troubled West Asian geopolitics. Also, the
US has only removed secondary sanctions that restrict the dealings of
other countries with Iran. Primary sanctions that bar US citizens and
companies from business with Iran will remain. In reality, the
possibility of US and Iran entering into normal diplomatic relations is
"very far off." The deal, thus, is more than a document; it is a process
where analysis and debate play an important role. **[It will put an end
to decades of hostility, years of posturing and months of
speculation.]{.underline}** It is not clear what could happen to the
Iran-US détente if a Republican is elected to the White House. But if
both nations overcome these challenges and sustain the momentum, it can
transform the region for the better in the long run.

#### Iran will not participate in a nuclear war 

**Davis et al 11** (Book- Iran's Nuclear Future -Critical U.S. Policy
Choices Lynn E. Davis, Jeffrey Martini, Alireza Nader, Dalia Dassa Kaye,
James T. Quinlivan, Paul Steinberg Published by the Rand corporation)

**Current U.S. Conventional and Nuclear Posture Is Sufficient.** The
case for why Iran will be deterred from using nuclear weapons against
U.S. military forces rests on a number of considerations. First,
**[while possibilities of a proxy conflict or limited military
engagements exist, it is difficult to see a conflict between the United
States and Iran esca- lating to a major conventional conflict, because
Iran faces overwhelm- ing destruction.]{.underline}** **[Crossing the
nuclear threshold risks further devasta- tion for Iran, thereby directly
threatening the regime's survival;]{.underline}** also, in using its
nuclear weapons, Iran would be using up the very weapons it had acquired
for other purposes. Second, the United States, with the deployment of
long-range conventional precision-strike systems, has credible military
capabilities to inflict high levels of devastation with- out resorting
to the use of nuclear weapons. In this approach, existing U.S.
declarations with respect to using nuclear weapons would remain
unchanged**[. The threat of U.S. nuclear retaliation could be made more
explicit in the event of a conventional conflict so as to reduce the
pros- pect of Iran misreading U.S. intentions.]{.underline}**

#### Sanctions do not cause Iranian Nuclear war -- A similar situation was set up in 2006 but NOTHING happen

**Friedman 16** (Meredith Friedman, economist at Mauldin specializing in
foreign countries and US relations with economics. "Iran and Nukes: From
Fear and Loathing to Loathing and Cooperation", Mauldin Economics)

International sanctions on Iran were lifted on Saturday. It was
determined that Iran had carried out its obligations under its agreement
with the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany to
stop pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. At Geopolitical
Futures, we expected sanctions to be lifted and Iran to agree to halt
these activities. However, our forecast was not based on the issue of
nuclear weapons. Rather, it was based on our model, which indicated
there would be cooperation between the US and Iran as a result of
converging strategic interests[. Nuclear weapons were at one point the
main issue when it came to Iran. But by the time an agreement began to
emerge, they had become a minor issue.]{.underline} There were much more
important problems that needed to be addressed. These problems included
the future of the region, the Islamic State, and the common interests of
the United States and Iran on both subjects. [Let's begin with the
question of Iran and nuclear weapons. Ever since the 1990s, some had
argued that Iran was likely to develop nuclear weapons in the near
future. By the mid-2000s, the expectation was that it would have these
weapons within two years. As each year passed, the due date for when
they would be developed moved by another year. The fact that the
predictions were constantly wrong didn't deter the predictors at all. At
a certain point, it became necessary to address this question: If Iran
was hard at work on nuclear weapons, and was on the verge of building
one, why did an underground test never take place? Building a
deliverable **nuclear weapon is hard and involves much more than simply
enriching uranium.**]{.underline} Just consider the stresses a completed
nuclear weapon, miniaturized to rest on top of a missile, has to
undergo. It has to withstand the massive G-forces and vibration of a
launch, enter a vacuum where the temperatures vary by hundreds of
degrees each second, then re-enter the atmosphere at thousands of
degrees, and then explode. Even building a sufficiently ruggedized and
miniaturized atomic bomb that can be delivered by aircraft is difficult.
But detonating a nuclear device (it's not yet a weapon) underground as
part of a testing process is much easier. The device can be as fragile
and sprawling as you want. It isn't going anywhere. It was my view that
Iran might possibly manage a test explosion, but a weaponized system was
beyond its capacity. A nuclear test, however, was a risky move. Having a
uranium enrichment program, just secret enough that every intelligence
agency in the world knew about it, was extremely useful. It allowed
others to obsess over Iran's nuclear power, and that's exactly what Iran
wanted. [It had learned the North Korean gambit. The West, and
particularly the United States, is obsessed with the mere possibility of
nuclear weapons. If you actually build one, the risk is the US may
attack you. If you aren't building one, you will be ignored. But have a
nuclear program, without a nuclear bomb, and you will neither be
attacked nor ignored. That's what Iran wanted and what it got**. It
gained international leverage and attention far beyond what it would
have received without a program.**]{.underline} And that attention could
be used domestically to demonstrate the power of the regime, and
regionally to block any extremely aggressive move against Iran, as had
happened in Iraq. Becoming too aggressive toward Iran risked the
unknown, since it might have been further along in developing a nuclear
weapon than was thought. Therefore, Iran's nuclear program was less
about building a weapon than building uncertainty. This strategy came
with a price. The US and European sanctions hurt the Iranian economy
substantially. However, the sanctions did not have an immediate impact
on Iran's public pursuit of the bomb. [The sanctions began in 2006 and
escalated from there. So clearly, as much as the West would like to
think that it was the sanction regime that changed Iranian
policy,]{.underline} the lapse of a decade would seem to indicate that
this was not what broke them. The freezing of assets mattered of course,
and the lack of substantial oil revenue and investments also took a
toll. But given that the Iranians were not compelled to agree to a
settlement when oil was at \$100 a barrel and sanctions on oil sales
would have had the biggest impact, they were unlikely to feel compelled
at \$30 a barrel. Sanctions hurt, but not enough to force a change in
policy. That's because sanctions helped the Iranian government
politically. Here were six countries, five of them nuclear powers,
obsessed with stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. The sanctions
were used to demonstrate both the injustice with which the West treated
Iran and the fear they had of Iran. This was a heady brew, and the
Iranian government used it as more than a counterweight to sanctions.
The ability of the Iranians to absorb economic difficulties was
substantial. But the pictures of Iranian officials meeting with global
powers as equals and challenging their hypocrisy were political gold.
And the nuclear program opened the long-term possibility of reaching an
agreement that would benefit Iran. Then the region was transformed, and
the putative nuclear program decreased in importance to both the United
States, in particular, and Iran. This transformation was caused by the
emergence of a powerful Sunni movement that was able to take and hold
territory in a large region: the Islamic State. The Iranians had
experienced the difficulty of dealing with a Sunni-controlled state in
the 1980s, when it fought a war with Iraq under Saddam Hussein that cost
them about a million casualties. Iran's worst-case scenario wasn't war
with the United States, but war with a strong Sunni force to their west.
The Islamic State was not yet that powerful, but its existence was
sufficient to cause Iranian foreign policy to swerve in a new direction.
Put differently, a civil war appeared to be breaking out between Sunnis
and Shiites, and it was an overwhelming imperative that the Sunni
coalition be broken before it could dominate Iraq, and certainly before
it could threaten Iran. Iran proved incapable of breaking IS by itself.
It needed an anti-IS coalition, and the United States had to play some
role in that coalition. By this point, nuclear programs were simply
irrelevant to the reality of Iran. The United States also shifted its
regional strategy. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States
discovered a core lesson. It could defeat any conventional or
near-conventional enemy army, but it could not occupy either country
without fighting an extended war against insurgents and terrorists who
were deeply committed to their cause. This was not a new discovery. The
Romans, British, and Germans learned this lesson as well. During World
War II, in Germany and Japan, the US did succeed in peaceful occupation,
not only by waging a military war, but by smashing the society as well.
But at that time, it had 10 million men under arms, an economy entirely
devoted to the war effort, and powerful allies like Britain and the
Soviet Union. Without these things, the only goal that could be achieved
was winning hearts and minds and, as it learned in Vietnam, that was
easier in theory than practice. Therefore, the United States developed a
new strategy. Since it could not control the region through its
military, it had no choice but to allow the region to evolve as it
would. It was now up to regional powers, who had far more at stake than
the United States---and couldn't withdraw---to manage the situation. The
United States would provide air power, intelligence, weapons, and
training, but it would not take the primary responsibility on the ground
for shaping the situation---because trying consistently led to failure,
and continuing to do the same thing hoping for a different outcome is
the definition of insanity, to use an appropriate cliché. There were
four regional powers who were compelled to be interested in the
development of the Islamic State. They were Saudi Arabia, Turkey,
Israel, and Iran. Each was threatened by the rise of IS. Each was
utterly different from the others and in most cases shared a degree of
hostility with each other. Some were close to the United States, and
some were hostile. Iran was hostile, yet it was the most concerned of
all about IS. The Turks had shown a tendency to try to manage their
relations with IS by tacitly ignoring the group. They reportedly allowed
the passage of IS operatives and the sale of IS-controlled oil through
Turkey and permitted IS militants to use Turkish banks. Tension with IS
had grown substantially, but Turkey had not yet committed major forces
to the fight against the group. The Saudis, like the Turks, were Sunnis,
and while they were concerned about IS, they were far more worried about
what Iran might do in the Persian Gulf. The Israelis were worried about
everything, but they also understood that a war of attrition against IS
was not something they could afford and that an Israeli intervention
would only strengthen IS. In a traditional balance of power strategy,
the major power maintains common interests with each of the lesser
players, while appreciating tension between these nations. That allows
the major power to maintain control by being the only one each nation
trusts. As the US moved from its strategy of using direct force as its
normal mode of operation to using a balance of power to bring regional
force to bear, it had to begin the process of balancing regional
relationships. Without this, the US would be merely leading a coalition
against one of the players. This shift required a closer relationship
with Iran. Neither country liked the other, but they had at least some
common interests. More important, the US had close relations with the
other three regional powers, and this created the appearance of being an
anti-Iranian coalition. Particularly as a Sunni rising coalesced around
IS, a working relationship with Iran became essential. The nuclear
settlement was designed to at least clear the ground for this
relationship. Obviously, this meant drawing away from the Saudis, who
feared the Iranians, and also allowing friction to build up in the
Americans' relationship with Israel. However, Israel and Saudi Arabia
maintained their relationships with the US regardless, as they had no
choice. The wildcard was Turkey, which wanted nothing to do with this
coalition of the frightened, but has over time moved into an
increasingly hostile position toward IS. But it is Iran that has an
overriding interest in breaking IS. More than any other issue---the
Assad regime, Israel, or nuclear weapons---Iran has an interest in the
future of IS. It cannot defeat IS by itself, and it knows that the
modest Russian intervention in Syria won't accomplish the task either.
The only power that can both use significant force against IS and create
an anti-IS coalition is the US. Saudi Arabia fears Iran, and that is
precisely why it must follow the American lead. Israel may not have a
military role, but its intelligence and other capabilities can't be
withheld if the US wants it in the mix. And Turkey, as resistant as it
is, cannot face a hostile Russia and an indifferent US. It must be
brought in as well. Now all of this is far more complex than I have made
it, but the bottom line is that the United States and Iran have common
interests that override other considerations. It will be argued that any
arrangement with Iran is temporary and that in the end the Iranians may
turn on the US---or the US may turn on them. This is absolutely true**[.
No arrangement between nations lasts longer than their interests
dictate]{.underline}**. The US alliance with the Soviet Union crumbled
after World War II, while Germany and Japan became allies. The US is now
discussing military cooperation with Vietnam. There is no end to the
complexity of the relationships between nations. Iran and the United
States are not friends. There is no friendship between nations. There
are interests---and both share an interest in breaking IS. Even
together, they are unable to achieve this task, so others must be
compelled to play their part. And when it's over, different interests
will emerge and different constellations of nations will evolve. And so,
the great terror of Iranian nukes has been replaced by the great terror
of an IS caliphate. Both terrors are legitimate, but passing. For the
moment, the US and Iran are afraid of the same thing. This is the finest
basis for a shift in relationships between nations.

that the [U.S. and

are heading for war]{.underline}. When Trump was warning that North
Korea faced "fire and fury" if it threatened the United States, we
[wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/03/why-nuclear-war-with-north-korea-is-less-likely-than-you-think/?utm_term=.31e3bc7aac0c)
about why, despite the rhetoric, war was unlikely. This time, **[some
factors are indeed pushing the two sides toward conflict. But forces of
restraint are also reducing the likelihood of war.]{.underline}**
Tensions can lead to a "spiral" of escalation. [Both the United States
and Iran [say that they do not want a
war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-considers-responses-to-potential-iranian-attacks-including-troop-increase/2019/05/14/68cf79e3-c521-4c27-851e-09e6c863468a_story.html?utm_term=.45479698e408),
but that they are prepared to fight if the other side starts
one]{.underline}. What's worrisome is what political scientists call the
[spiral
model](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/cooperation-under-the-security-dilemma/C8907431CCEFEFE762BFCA32F091C526)
of conflict escalation. Sometimes, when countries take measures they
think will improve their own security, potential opponents can perceive
that as threatening --- a classic [security
dilemma](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/idealist-internationalism-and-the-security-dilemma/7094783665386FD81A25DF98C7EEC223).
Those potential opponents then take
[measures](https://twitter.com/ilangoldenberg/status/1129749338471751685)
to improve their own security --- which the first country sees as
threatening. And so on. When countries do not
[trust](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8091.html) each other, and
perhaps even fear that the other side wants war, they are unlikely to
believe conciliatory signals from the other side, and nobody wants to
appear weak. The result is a spiral of conflict. The [past few
weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/a-visual-guide-to-the-gulf-tanker-attacks)'
events have certainly ratcheted up tensions. The recent tanker attack
and America's decision to quickly blame Iran only raises them further.
And as [Tyler Jost and Rob
Schub](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/18/trump-tweeted-theres-no-infighting-us-policy-iran-does-he-have-all-information/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f136a7e333d9)
wrote here at TMC last month, the Trump administration's decision-making
process could make it even more difficult to navigate the [tricky
problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/04/26/trump-is-trying-to-send-north-korea-a-message-leaders-can-signal-but-its-hard-to-pull-off/?utm_term=.868761162f97)
of reading and responding to signals in a crisis like this. War would be
very costly in this case. A conflict between Iran and the United States
could be [very
costly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/14/conflict-with-iran-would-not-be-like-iraq-war-itd-be-worse/?utm_term=.c92eb332ad5b).
For instance, in such a war, Iran might use mines to keep ships from
traveling through traffic in the Strait of Hormuz --- a crucial, narrow
passage for world [energy
supplies](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00135).
If that happened, the U.S. options for clearing the mines would be
complicated and costly, as [Caitlin
Talmadge](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2008.33.1.82)
argues. Such an operation might require hitting targets inside Iran or
risk Iranian retaliation from coastal positions given the narrow
geographic chokepoint --- all pointing toward further escalation.
Knowing this, the United States might instead
[choose](https://twitter.com/ProfTalmadge/status/1139538074986328064) to
go straight to a bombing campaign. But coercive bombing might also lead
to
[escalation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/this-is-how-easily-the-us-and-iran-could-blunder-into-war/2019/05/23/40dbbcae-7c07-11e9-8ede-f4abf521ef17_story.html?utm_term=.91ac32d2ffb3).
Despite these dangers, there are still important constraints on both
sides. Misperception rarely causes war. The spiral model may not be the
right way to think about how conflicts escalate. **[Missed signals and
miscalculation can indeed generate tension. But leaders have many ways
to avoid conflicts that they do not want to fight. The historical record

[The latest incident between the United States and Iran this week almost
immediately generated a torrent of punditry.]{.underline} There was a
backlash from those who see the [detention of 10 U.S.
sailors](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/13/politics/iran-sailors-sanctions-obama/)
who inadvertently strayed into Iran\'s territorial waters as
confirmation of Tehran\'s continuing penchant for troublemaking[. But
there was applause from others, including the Obama administration, who
trumpeted Tehran\'s swift release of the sailors as **[vindication of
U.S. diplomacy with
Iran](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/13/politics/nancy-pelosi-iran-deal-returned-sailors/)
and a confirmation of the quiet moderation of its revolutionary
regime.**]{.underline} As is always the case with Iran, the truth lies
somewhere between these extremes. [That the episode did not escalate or
extend beyond a day represents a modestly hopeful sign]{.underline}.
After all, Iran\'s Islamic Republic has practically written the book on
defying diplomatic protocol as a means of antagonizing Washington and
the West. **[This pattern began with the 1979 seizure of the U.S.
Embassy and its personnel in Tehran and recurred on an unfortunately
regular basis through the decades, including the 2004 and 2007 detention
of British sailors.]{.underline}** That the Iranian leadership managed
to resist the temptation to exploit the waylaid sailors any further than
they did reinforces the lesson that was implicit in last summer\'s
conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear deal: At the highest levels, Iran
is seeking a different relationship with the world. And [the rapid
resolution of the episode is a testament to the utility of direct
bilateral communications, which were ruptured 36 years ago when the
hostage crisis began]{.underline}. A generation has passed since
ambassadors were exchanged or direct dialogue was routinely held. In the
interim, a patchwork system of third-party intermediaries and channels
via protecting power Today, thanks to the intense, protracted wrangling
over the details of the nuclear agreement, U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry has his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on speed dial,
and a nascent network of contacts has sprung up at the working levels of
both governments. [This is as it should be, and as it would have been
many years earlier if only the Iranians could have relinquished the
revolution\'s paranoia surrounding Washington.]{.underline} There can be
no question that the world is better off when old adversaries have fewer
impediments to interaction and more reliable mechanisms for managing or
even averting crises. However, to credit diplomacy and relationship
building as the primary impetus for the timely end to this particular
episode is an overstatement, to say the least. The reality is that the
single most important factor in shaping Tehran\'s response was not the
availability of communications channels, but the imminence of sanctions
relief. The sailors\' scrape was truly a case where timing was
everything; they went astray only days before the long-anticipated
\"implementation day\" for the nuclear deal, when United Nations
certification that Iran has completed its obligations under the
agreement will expunge many of the international sanctions that have
wreaked havoc on Iran\'s economy for the past five years. At that time,
Tehran will also reap newfound access to tens of billions of dollars
that sanctions stranded in foreign banks. When that kind of money talks,
even the Revolutionary Guard listens. The nuclear deal is an existential
concern for Tehran. And despite overheated anxieties about hardliner
opposition to the agreement, the agreement commands support at Tehran\'s
highest levels, at least for the moment. [With the payoff within reach,
Iran had every incentive to handle the run-in with the U.S. sailors
responsibly \-- tens of billions of incentives]{.underline}. The nuclear
deal surely hastened the sailors\' release, but not quite in the fashion
that the Obama Administration has been spinning. How the Iranians handle
such a predicament after the deal is done and its coffers are
replenished remains difficult to anticipate. So, can a crisis averted
can help foster a durable détente between the two countries? At this
stage, it\'s far too soon to say with any real confidence. Ideally, the
successful deployment of diplomacy to free the sailors will bolster
trust, encourage more constructive cooperation from Tehran, and sustain
some willingness from both sides to use direct dialogue as a means of
problem-solving. But Iranian politics continue to make any real
rapprochement complicated and, for the foreseeable future, almost wholly
out of reach. Even after the sailors were released, Iranian state
television broadcast video footage of their capture and a scripted
apology from one of the young American crewmen, amidst triumphal
headlines in Iranian newspapers about the humiliation of the Great
Satan. Such chest-thumping is a small price to pay for avoiding another
unpleasant standoff. But it is also a reminder that Washington and
Tehran still have a long a way to go before cooperation becomes the new
normal.

humanitarian disaster]{.underline}**. **[Ansar Allah regularly attacks
the Saudi border, launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the

with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs.
Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this
threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to
threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz. **[Those who advocate
withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can
somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy

Lebanese proxy group, every day. Never mind that Saudi Arabia is
supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this
effort. Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring
an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it. **[The U.S.

commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S.
homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries. **[The

warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated

and hope for the best]{.underline}**. **[Undermining the Yemeni
government and the Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable
political settlement impossible. The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia
will continue to fight this war with or without U.S.

condemn Saudi involvement, and ignore Iran's hostile role inside Yemen
will only do more harm to innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and
its Yemeni proxies.

#### War is gonna get won by Saudis

Knights 18 (Michael Knights, ME affairs specialist, "Is the Yemen War
Really Deadlocked? Think Again," The Washington Institute, 9/2018,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/is-the-yemen-war-really-deadlocked-think-again>)

[It has become a cliche to say tha]{.underline}t the war in [Yemen has
reached a point of]{.underline} military d[eadlock.]{.underline} Rebel
forces led by the Houthi clan control the capital Sanaa and the
country's largest port Hodeidah, and they have a proven track record of
slowing down the advances of the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led
coalition. That being said, [the Houthis have lost a lot of ground since
the apex of their territorial control in the spring of
2015]{.underline}, when they also controlled Aden and Taizz, the second
and third largest cities in Yemen, the legendary Marib Dam, and Yemen's
entire Red Sea coast. In the last three years, the Yemeni military and
the coalition liberated Aden, Marib Dam, much of Taizz, the Bab
el-Mandab Strait and half of Yemen's 420 kilometer Red Sea coast, in
addition to driving Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) out of
Mukalla city, nearby ports and Yemen's key energy export pipeline
corridors. [The next coalition gain is likely to be the ports of
Hodeidah and Saleef, plus the remainder of the Red Sea coastal plain.
The fight will be tough, because the Houthis know that the loss of the
coast will leave them landlocked for the first time since they seized
control of the Red Sea port of Midi in 2011]{.underline}. Having an
opening to the sea allowed the Houthi militia Ansar Allah to acquire
modern armaments and training from Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah,
including Iranian-manufactured Qiam 1 medium-range ballistic missiles
capable of striking Riyadh. [While the Houthi defense will be strong,
their forces in Hodeidah are heavily outnumbered by advancing Yemeni and
coalition troops, and locally-recruited Houthi allies are likely to flip
sides as the Houthis lose terrain]{.underline}. Already, UAE-backed
Yemeni brigades are wrapping around the northeastern quarter of Hodeidah
city, placing them within striking distance of the port and the last
road through which the Houthis can draw reinforcements or escape. If
Hodeidah is liberated this year, as seems likely, the question is then
whether the war has reached a point of equilibrium, with the south, east
and west liberated, while the Houthis remain quite capable of defending
the northern highlands and Sanaa. When visiting the Nihm front in March
this year, I GPS'd my position just 38.9 kilometers outside the US
Embassy in Sanaa. But this last stretch is the longest, because the
Yemeni military lacks the numbers or the cohesion to assault the
capital. The Houthis have no incentive to bargain away their control of
Sanaa in UN-brokered talks, and will likely value the capital even more
highly if they lose control of their coastline. It could take years for
the Yemeni military---split between loyalists of the late Ali Abdullah
Saleh and pro-Muslim Brotherhood Islah Party members---to build the
capabilities and unity needed to assault Sanaa. In the meantime, there
is one other option for the Saudi-led coalition. This is a direct
assault on Saada, the heartland of the Houthi clan, and it has arguably
already begun. On the northwestern side of Saada, Saudi Arabian forces
are penetrating Al Malahidh district in the foothills of the Marran
Mountains, the Houthi stronghold facing Jizan province, placing them 60
kilometers from Saada. To the northeast of Saada, Yemeni and Sudanese
forces backed by the coalition are 20 kilometers from Kitaf, a town 50
kilometers from Saada that Saudi-backed Salafis view as a spiritual
center. To the south of Saada, two coalition thrusts are slowly pushing
from the west and east to cut Saada off from Sanaa---one group of
Saudi-backed Yemeni and Sudanese forces coming from the coastal plain
and one Yemeni front coming from the east, striking out from Al Maton
district in Al Jawf province. Though coalition progress is slow and
costly on these fronts, Saudi Arabia feels it has plenty of time and
more than enough forces to continue gaining ground in Saada province[.
If the Houthis are cut off from Iranian resupply and begin to suffer
rolling defections, the rate of advance could increase. Saudi Arabia has
quietly ramped up its direct contribution, deploying large elements of
six Saudi Arabian National Guard and Royal Saudi Land Forces brigades
into Saada]{.underline}. Riyadh is also replacing Yemeni battlefield
losses in armored vehicles directly from Saudi Arabia's mammoth
equipment reserves. As importantly, some of the most experienced Salafi
fighters in Yemen, currently serving in large numbers on the Hodeidah
front, are likely to be released for operations on the Kitaf front soon,
where many of them fought the Houthis in 2004-2014. [The Gulf coalition
believes that the Houthis currently have no incentive to withdraw from
Hodeidah or Sanaa, which was graphically demonstrated when they failed
to show up at the Geneva peace talks this month. This assessment is
probably correct. For hardliners within the Houthi leadership, any
agreement will probably result in them losing their current dominance in
Sanaa and on the Red Sea coast]{.underline}. The coalition is likely to
keep pushing militarily in order to shift this calculus. For Saudi
Arabia, it is preferable to support a multi-year, or even multi-decade,
war of attrition rather than let a southern Hezbollah establish itself
on the Red Sea. The war may be deadlocked this year, but neither the
Houthis nor Riyadh have short-term agendas in Yemen.

#### Control of hodeidah is the impediment to stopping famine; houthis

**Block, 18** (Joshua S. Block, [a communications, foreign policy and
political strategist who has been involved in national politics and
policy for nearly 20 years. "Control of hodeidah" The Jerusalem
Post)]{.mark}

Now that UN peace efforts appear to be falling apart, [the war in Yemen
is approaching a decisive battle for control of the port of Hodeidah.
Iran's role in intensifying a conflict of already epic proportions is
testimony to the White House's decision to re-impose sanctions on the
Iranian regime, and thereby limit cash flow to Tehran's regional proxy
forces.]{.underline} [Hodeidah is Yemen's lifeline. Approximately
twothird of total imports -- including vital food, healthcare and
clothing -- enter the country through the port city. Hodeidah is also
the principle gateway through which Iran channels illicit arms to the
Zaydi Shia Houthi rebels. The Houthis have controlled the strategic port
city of a half million people since 2014. The insurgency group has been
found time and again to mismanage vital humanitarian deliveries in order
to serve their selfish political ends. Human rights groups have accused
the movement of blocking aid deliveries, threatening volunteers and
blocking the transfer of wounded civilians in a cynical infringement of
basic humanitarian law. Over 22 million Yemenis -- almost the entire
population -- are in urgent need of assistance. Some 16 million lack
access to safe water and are at severe risk of malnutrition, while
50,000 died from cholera last year alone, according to data from the
UN]{.underline}. Last week, the World Health Organization warned that
the war-torn country is on the brink of a third cholera epidemic. It is
therefore imperative for the UN to take this lifeline out of Houthi
control. [The UN has proposed a plan under which the Houthis would turn
over the city to a neutral international regime to guarantee
humanitarian access to millions of civilians. The Houthis, however,
appear to have exploited the peace negotiations to further entrench
their forces in Hodeidah, actively recruiting children]{.underline} as
young as 15 to fight on the frontlines. The situation is grim, and the
chances for peace appear to have dimmed considerably. Houthi activity in
the city has intensified, and the group has made it clear that there are
no terms under which they will hand over the city to an internationally-
supervised operation. IN LATE JULY, the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil
tankers in international waters, after which Saudi Arabia announced the
temporary cessation of all oil shipments through the Bab el-Mandeb
Strait -- one of the world's most important commercial shipping lanes.
In the latest flare-up of violence, t[he insurgency group attacked a
fish market in Hodeidah, which according to medical sources, took the
lives of at least 26 people. The Houthis can wage this campaign of
aggression only because of the support they receive from their Iranian
masters]{.underline}. The Houthis are a desert tribe. They previously
had neither access to nor training in sophisticated weapons. It is clear
that the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM), which
provides clearance for commercial shipping to Houthi-controlled
territory, has failed to stop the flow of illicit arms to the rebels.
Since the war broke out and the Houthis unseated the legitimate
government of Yemen, the group has received training, expertise and
weapons from Iran and Hezbollah. A report by the British All Party
Parliamentary Group for Yemen revealed in May that Tehran has supplied
the Houthis with anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles and sea mines as
part of a pattern of nefarious behavior around the region. "Several
illicit arms shipments from Iran to Yemen have been confiscated by
international patrols, despite a UN embargo on arms transfers from Iran,
which constitute a direct violation of UN Security Council Resolution
2231," the APPG said. [Whoever controls Hodeidah holds the balance of
power, and the liberation of Yemen's strategic sea port could be the
beginning to ending the war. It is a major source of revenue for the
Houthis, and cutting their supply lines is central to forcing them back
into the mountains and away from the Red Sea. This development would not
only strengthen the stability of the region, it would also enhance the
security of Western countries concerned with Iran's aggressive
expansionism.]{.underline}

<https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/ending-us-military-support-saudi-arabia-yemen-would-trigger-dangerous>)

In a new resolution, a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the
United States to end its involvement---specifically its support of Saudi
Arabia---in the Yemen conflict. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to
pass a procedural measure that will clear the way for a floor debate on
the issue next week. The push comes largely in response to the recent
murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Trump administration has
banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder from entering the U.S., imposed
sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and expressed its willingness to take
further action if warranted by ongoing investigations. Many senators
seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even if it means sacrificing the
interests of the Yemeni government and making a negotiated settlement of
the conflict more difficult. The killing of Khashoggi was certainly
abhorrent, but [ending U.S. support for the multinational coalition in
Yemen is not the proper solution]{.underline}. It risks dangerously
conflating two separate issues and would inevitably trigger unintended
consequences that would undermine U.S. national security interests in
the region. Senators must remember that [Saudi Arabia is not the only
belligerent in Yemen. A cutoff of U.S. support would also hurt the
elected and internationally recognized government of Yemen]{.underline},
which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup
that violated a U.N.-brokered ceasefire. Withdrawing U.S. support would
also harm the interests of other U.S. allies fighting in Yemen,
including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The war in Yemen is
complex. [Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia entirely for the
suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes and heavy-handed
treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents]{.underline} and
the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah
("Supporters of Allah") movement, a Shia Islamist extremist group. [The
Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian
casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But the Houthis should
not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly
sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles. Ansar Allah also deserves
criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the
conditions that led to the current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah
regularly]{.underline} attacks the Saudi border, launches missiles
strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and [diverts
international medical and food aid to favor its own supporters and sell
on the black market.]{.underline} Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S.
Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian shipping in the Red
Sea with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs.
Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this
threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to
threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz. [Those who advocate
withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can
somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy
that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group that chants "Death
to America" and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese proxy
group]{.underline}, every day. Never mind that Saudi Arabia is
supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this
effort. [Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring
an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it.
The]{.underline} U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi
Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing. There
are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional
commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S.
homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries. The
Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi
warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated
settlement. But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies
and hope for the best. [Undermining the Yemeni government and the
Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement
impossible. The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to
fight this war with or without U.S. support.]{.underline} Those who
would connect two unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and
ignore Iran's hostile role inside Yemen will only do more harm to
innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and its Yemeni proxies.

Would Be Worse Without U.S. Involvement," July 25, 2018,

[There is no question that Yemen is confronting a humanitarian crisis
that has been exacerbated by the entry of the Saudi-led coalition into
the war. However, much of this crisis has been manufactured by the
Houthis themselves. The Houthi government's total neglect of sanitation
services, and **its failure to maintain and repair sewer and water
infrastructure**, has contributed to the deepening of **the cholera
epidemic**. Additionally, the **Houthi have confiscated food, medicine,
and critical life-saving medical equipment** to give to militia members
or to sell on the black market at wildly inflated prices. Also, they
have widely used **landmines and the forced recruitment of child
soldiers**, many of whom are under fifteen years of age, all of which
further compounds Yemen's humanitarian crisis. **In contrast, areas that
the Saudi-led coalition have restored to Yemeni government control do
not suffer the same disastrous conditions** that civilians in
Houthi-controlled regions are experiencing]{.underline}. Furthermore,
vital U.S. interests are at stake. The Houthis have repeatedly
threatened to disrupt international shipping. Earlier this year, they
made good on this promise by firing on a Saudi oil tanker and a Turkish
freighter carrying wheat. The Houthi militias are a sworn enemy of the
United States and a tool for expanding Tehran's destabilizing influence
throughout the Middle East. The Iranians have supplied ballistic
missiles to the Houthis that have been launched against America's Saudi,
Emirati, and Yemeni allies. [For the United States to withdraw its
support now would be tantamount to conceding Yemen to Iran, which would
deal a serious blow to Washington's regional credibility]{.underline}.
The war against Iran and the Houthis is also linked with the United
States' war on terror, which is supported by Congress, specifically the
fight against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an organization
that is based in Yemen and is widely considered to be the most dangerous
of al-Qaeda's remaining regional affiliates. For example, the Saudi-led
coalition helped to build the elite anti-Houthi Southern Security Belt
forces. These United Arab Emirates--trained Yemeni units have, alongside
Emirati special forces, fought AQAP. Last year, they pushed them out of
the Shabwah Governorate, where, six years ago, a U.S. drone successfully
targeted one of the al-Qaeda terrorists responsible for the 2000 attack
on the USS Cole. In addition, [the U.S. military plays a critical role
in safeguarding Yemeni civilians by identifying nonmilitary and civilian
facilities for the coalition so that these are not accidentally targeted
by air strikes. This intelligence support has not prevented civilian
casualties altogether, but it has almost certainly reduced their number.
Also, American-produced Patriot missile defense systems have allowed the
coalition to intercept dozens of Houthi ballistic missiles fired
against]{.underline} Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni **[civilian population
centers.]{.underline}** American involvement also bolsters ties between
the U.S. military and the militaries of its Arab allies and these
relationships are a key tool of U.S. power and influence if America is
to remain globally relevant. [America should continue to support United
Nations Special Envoy Martin Griffiths' in his attempt to broker a
lasting political resolution. But the Houthis will have little incentive
to negotiate in good faith absent continuing military
pressure.]{.underline} Withdrawing U.S. support for the Saudi-led
coalition and for Yemen's internationally recognized government will
ease this pressure without doing anything to end Yemen's war. It also
will not help---and may even exacerbate---the country's humanitarian
crisis while dealing a blow to America's regional prestige and its short
and long-term strategic interests. Lawmakers would do well to consider
these costs as they seek to reclaim war-making powers from the executive
branch.

internationally recognised government agreed to take part in peace talks
in Sweden after a leader in the Houthi rebel group called for a halt to
military operations. Since the Houthi uprising in 2015, [the war has
turned [Yemen](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Yemen) into one of
the world's worst humanitarian disasters. The bulk of the criticism has
been placed on the Saudi-led coalition as well as the western countries
which arm it. But if we want to achieve peace in the region we need to
start to take into consideration the atrocities the [Houthi
rebels](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/houthi-rebels) have also
committed.]{.underline} In September 2014, [Houthi rebels, who only
represent a small minority of the population in Yemen, attacked the
capital city of Sanaa and seized it. Many Yemenis called this a coup
against the elected and internationally recognised Yemeni government.
The Houthis were able to take the capital in just a few days thanks to
the backing they received from
[Iran](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Iran), which]{.underline}
[[has been providing Houthi
rebels](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-iran-houthis/exclusive-iran-steps-up-support-for-houthis-in-yemens-war-sources-idUSKBN16S22R)
with missiles which have targeted [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SaudiArabia)]{.underline},
and seems likely to continue to do so regardless of UN sanctions. The
war in Yemen is a proxy for Iran's war against Saudi Arabia, as part of
its wider Shia Crescent strategy, which aims to link a network of allies
spanning from the border with Iraq to Lebanon in a crescent shape. In
February 2014, the head of [the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) Quds forces, Qasem Soleimani, in a meeting with Iranian armed
forces,]{.underline}
[[explained](https://www.farsnews.com/news/13921127001191/%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7-%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%88-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B7)
the motivation behind Iran's strategy in the region, dubbed the Shia
Crescent. He said: "The Shia Crescent is not political but it is
actually an economic crescent]{.underline}, as Shias hold 80 per cent of
the world's oil in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Iran."
**[Without understanding this core reason behind the Houthi offensive,
achieving peace in Yemen is nigh on impossible -- any plan to end the
war without putting more pressure on Iran to dismantle its Quds forces
is highly likely to fail]{.underline}**, as we've seen since the
beginning of this conflict. **[Houthis are merely a proxy of the IRGC's
Quds forces]{.underline}**. However, [now that Iran is under intense
pressure by the current US administration and its own people, it can no
longer continue to arm and sponsor the Houthis like before]{.underline}.
Consequently, Houthi rebels have been pushed to show willingness in
negotiations for the time being. Nevertheless, **[it is important to
remember that Houthi rebels have refused to join any peace talks to end
the war in Yemen in the past.]{.underline}** According to Kamal
Kharrazi, the head of Iran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations,
Tehran is negotiating with European countries about the Yemen crisis
and, according to Iranian media, the war was the top priority of the
discussion between British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Iranian
officials on Monday. [But from the Iranian perspective, a ceasefire in
Yemen is only crucial for the time being because it needs to focus on
domestic economic challenges as the country hopes to ease US sanctions.
It is hard to imagine they are truly seeking a peaceful resolution to
the conflict, as it remains a key part of their wider regional strategy
of expanding their influence]{.underline}. Indeed, look at other
countries where Iran has sought to impose its influence -- namely Iraq,
Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, which are extremely divided and unstable.
There is little reason to assume Iran's intentions are different in
Yemen. This suggests the main reason behind Houthi rebels announcing
halting attacks on the Saudi-led coalition is linked to Iran's current
domestic problems, as opposed to a genuine willingness to find peace in
the region. [Yemen is not an isolated war but intrinsically linked to
Iran's wider regional strategy. Unless this aspect begins to be
highlighted more insistently, it is difficult to see any lasting peace
in Yemen -- a treaty could be signed, but as Iran faces other problems
it could return to destabilising Yemen because it is a crucial part of
Iran's Shia Crescent into Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} It is highly
unlikely Iran will stop pursuing its belligerent efforts to establish
its Shia Crescent in the long run because that is the very essence and
purpose of the Islamic regime of Iran. This poses a great threat to the
stability in the region, and threatens Saudi Arabia and Bahrain which
have significant Shia population in their countries. In relation to
this, James Mattis, US defence secretary, recently
[stated](https://dod.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1674583/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-international-institute-for-strategic-studies-ma/)
that [the US has significant evidence which indicates Iran has been
transferring a significant amount of weapons into Bahrain**. Such
evidence is an indication of how serious Iran's destabilising role in
the region is, and how determined it is to establish a Shia
Crescent**]{.underline}, which must be taken into consideration by the
international community. **[It is crucial to put pressure on Iran to
dismantle its Quds forces because herein lies the key to peace in the
region and in Yemen. The wars in the [Middle
East](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MiddleEast) are part of wider
geopolitical tensions, and Yemen cannot be dealt with in isolation of
the rest of the region's instability, which the Quds forces have a lot
to answer for.]{.underline}**

**[The chief of Houthi rebels in
[Yemen](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html) has said he
will \"never surrender\" to Saudi-backed pro-government
forces]{.underline}** as a fierce battle for control of a key port city
deepens the humanitarian crisis. \"**[Does the enemy think that
penetrating this or that area, or seizing this or that area, means we

control?\"]{.underline}** **[Abdel-Malik al-Houthi said]{.underline}**
on Wednesday in a televised address. \"**[This is not happening and will
not happen ever]{.underline}**,\" he said, according to AFP news agency.
Hodeidah is a strategic port for humanitarian aid and is the entry point
for over 70 percent of imports into Yemen, the poorest country in the
Arab world. **[Nearly 200 fighters have been]{.underline}** [**[killed

have lost ground in the battle for Hodeidah and accused pro-government
forces of provoking an escalation in violence. \"**[The enemy benefits
from its numbers, which it has increased even further to pressure the
city of Hodeidah,\" said the chief of the Houthi rebels]{.underline}**.
His statement came shortly after Saudi-backed forces said they have
pounded rebel positions with an air attack and a ground assault, and now
control a major road leading to the port city. Yemeni military officials
and witnesses on both sides of the Hodeidah front line on Wednesday said
the alliance secured an urban area along 50th Street, which leads to the
Red Sea port about 5km away.

In a new resolution, a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the
United States to end its involvement---specifically its support of Saudi
Arabia---in the Yemen conflict. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to
pass a procedural measure that will clear the way for a floor debate on
the issue next week. The push comes largely in response to the recent
murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Trump administration has
banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder from entering the U.S., imposed
sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and expressed its willingness to take
further action if warranted by ongoing investigations. Many senators
seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even if it means sacrificing the
interests of the Yemeni government and making a negotiated settlement of
the conflict more difficult. [The killing of Khashoggi was certainly
abhorrent, but [ending U.S. support for the]{.mark} multinational
[coalition in Yemen is not the]{.mark} proper [solution. It]{.mark}
risks dangerously conflating two separate issues and [would inevitably
trigger unintended consequences that would undermine U.S. national
security interests in the region.]{.mark}]{.underline} Senators must
remember that Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in Yemen. A
[cutoff of U.S. support would also hurt the elected and internationally
recognized government of Yemen, which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi
rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup that violated a U.N.-brokered ceasefire.
Withdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S.
allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and
Bahrain. The war in Yemen is complex. [Those who rush to blame Saudi
Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war
crimes]{.mark} and heavy-handed treatment [meted out by the
Houthis]{.mark} to their opponents [and the]{.mark} ruthless
[role]{.mark} that [Iran plays in]{.mark} [supporting the]{.mark} Houthi
[Ansar Allah]{.mark} ("Supporters of Allah") movement, [a]{.mark} Shia
Islamist [extremist group]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Saudis are rightly
criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian casualties as they
target Ansar Allah positions. But [the Houthis should not be given a
free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly sophisticated Iranian
ballistic missiles. [Ansar Allah also deserves criticism for its violent
role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the
current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi
border]{.mark}, launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, [and diverts international]{.mark} medical and
food [aid]{.mark} to favor its own supporters and sell on the black
market. [Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of
allied nations, and civilian shipping in the Red Sea]{.mark} [with
Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs. Undermining
the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to international shipping and giving Iran
the opportunity to threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab
Strait, just as it has threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz. [Those
who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe
that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a
one-sided strategy that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group
that chants "Death to America"]{.underline} and looks more like
Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese proxy group, every day. Never mind that Saudi
Arabia is supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen
in this effort. Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will
not bring an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it.
[The U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi Arabia in
Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing]{.underline}.
There are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for
occasional commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the
U.S. homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries. The
Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi
warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated
settlement. But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies
and hope for the best. Undermining the Yemeni government and the
Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement
impossible. [The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to
fight this war with or without U.S. support]{.underline}. Those who
would connect two unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and
ignore Iran's hostile role inside Yemen will only do more harm to
innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and its Yemeni proxies.

#### Chinese Tech has been used to bomb Yemen and China can fill in -- drones prove

the Middle East. \"China\'s Saudi drone factory compensates for US
ban,\" Middle East Eye, Published 3/29/2017, Accessed 7/16/2019,

[[China]{.mark} has [struck a]{.mark} surprise [deal to manufacture
military drones at a factory in Saudi Arabia]{.mark}. It forms part of a
suite of agreements totalling \$60bn agreed during King Salman\'s visit
to the country last month that will also see the two countries develop
oil refineries and co-operate on China's Chang E-4 moon
mission.]{.underline} The deal comes as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf
neighbours continue an unprecedented rush for arms to cope with what
they see as a number of counter-terrorism threats across the region.
Meanwhile, long-standing ally[, the United States shows no sign of
granting those countries access to its own military drone technology.
\"For a long time, China and Islamic countries have respected each other
and had win-win cooperation, and have created a model of the peaceful
coexistence of different cultures,\"]{.underline} Xi said, according to
China\'s Foreign Ministry. The factory, China's first in the Middle
East, will produce state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology
Corporation\'s (CASC) CH-4 Caihong, or \"Rainbow\" drone as well as
associated equipment, which would improve after-sales services for
clients in the Middle East. China plugs arms gap left by US The
conflicts in Syria and Yemen and the rise of the Islamic State (IS)
group have led countries in the region to increase their arms imports by
86 percent over the past five years, accounting for 29 percent of global
imports, according to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute. [Saudia
Arabia has become the world\'s second-largest arms importer, yet the
United States, its closest ally and main exporter of arms, refuses to
sell its Predator and Reaper drones, which go only to a small number of
European nations.]{.underline} The Saudis also felt incensed when last
December then-US President Barack Obama blocked an arms shipment to
Saudi Arabia after concerns were raised in Congress over civilian
casualties in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is despite the US waging
a controversial drone campaign to take out what it sees as suspected
al-Qaeda targets in Yemen for more than a decade. [[Saudi has]{.mark}
since [turned to China, which]{.mark} unlike the US, is not signatory to
the international Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and so [has fewer restrictions
on the sale of drone technology]{.mark}. [Chinese drones are cheaper
too.]{.mark} The CH-4 costs \$4m while [a low-end Chinese drone can cost
about \$1m]{.mark}. On the other hand, American Reaper drones can cost
in excess of \$17m.]{.underline} Added to this a slump in world oil
prices and it\'s easier to see why the CH-4 has become the killer drone
of choice for countries across the Middle East. "The CH-4 has recorded
outstanding performance in anti-terrorist attacks in Iraq, Yemen, as
well as in Africa's Sudan, Ethiopia and China's neighbouring Pakistan,"
Zhou Chenming, who previously worked for CASC's drone-development
subsidiary, told the South China Post newspaper. "That's why our Saudi
friends are so interested in the drone cooperation project," he added.
[[It is believed that Saudi Arabia]{.mark} and UAE have [used it for
airstrikes in Yemen]{.mark}. Last year the Iraqi defence ministry
released a video of a CH-4 strike on a car belonging to alleged IS
fighters in Iraq.]{.underline} The CH-4 has a range of about 3,500km and
can carry the AR-1 precision-guided missile that can hit a distant
target with a margin of error of less than 1.5 metres. At the launch
last month of a report assessing the military and defence capabilities
of countries around the world, John Chipman, director of the
International Institute of Strategic Studies, was cited by AFP as saying
that \"an emerging threat for deployed Western forces is that with China
looking to sell more abroad, they may confront more advanced military
systems, in more places, and operated by a broader range of
adversaries.\" The report found that in terms of air power, \"China
appears to be reaching near-parity with the West\". China\'s growing
role in Middle East Despite Chinese arms accounting for less than one
percent of Saudi Arabian arms imports, arms deals were central to the
formalising of Saudi Arabian-Chinese relations. In 1988, China sold
\$3.5bn worth of state-of-the-art nuclear-capable ballistic missiles to
Saudi Arabia, and two years later the oil-rich kingdom cut-off
diplomatic ties with Taiwan and formally recognised Beijing. Despite its
reliance on the region for oil, China has traditionally played little
part in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy. This has begun to change,
with China trying to get more involved in efforts to end Syria\'s
six-year-old civil war, where Riyadh supports rebels fighting President
Bashar al-Assad. China has also offered support for Yemen's embattled
government, which is backed by a Saudi-led Gulf Arab coalition in a war
against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement. But China will be mindful
to tread a careful line as it also enjoys a close relationship with
Iran. One Beijing-based diplomat from a Muslim-majority country told
Reuters that China was trying to play the role of "honest broker" in the
Middle East, as it lacks the historical baggage of the Americans or
Europeans.
