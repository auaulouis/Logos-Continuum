**[The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action]{.underline}**

[In policy propositions, **each topic contains certain key
elements**,]{.underline} although **[they have slightly different
functions]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the [comparable
elements]{.underline} of value-oriented propositions.

**[1. An agent to do the acting---"The United States"]{.underline}** in
"The United States should adopt a policy of free trade." [Like the
object of evaluation in a proposition of value, **the agent is usually
the subject of the sentence.**]{.underline}

**[2. The verb should---the first part of a verb phrase that urges an
action.]{.underline}**

**[3. An action verb to follow should in the should-verb
combination.]{.underline}** [For example]{.underline}, should adopt here
means to [put a program or policy into action through governmental
means.]{.underline}

**[4. A specification of directions or a limitation of the action
desired.]{.underline}** [The phrase]{.underline} free trade, for
example, **[gives direction and limits to the topic]{.underline}**,
which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs,
discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce.

**[Propositions of policy deal with future action]{.underline}**.
[Nothing has yet occurred. **The entire debate is about whether
something ought to occur**]{.underline}. [What you agree to do, then,
when you accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to offer
sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future
action that you propose.]{.underline}

[When you agree to accept the negative side, you actually enter into a
contract to offer sufficient reasons for an audience to reject the
affirmative's arguments.]{.underline}

#### FMS is government to government sales that include tech support, training, and software /hardware updates, while DCS is the transfer of an article or service between a government or corporation to the U.S. defense base

**Kaidanow, Acting assistant secretary of bureau of political-military
affairs, 17** (Tina, 6/15/17, "Foreign Military Sales: Process and
Policy",
<https://www.state.gov/foreign-military-sales-process-and-policy/>,
6/30/19, RY)

Arms transfers also support the U.S. defense industrial base and DoD
procurement. [Purchases made through the foreign military sales (FMS)
system often can be combined with DoD orders to reduce unit costs for
our own military]{.underline}; beyond this, the U.S. defense industry
employs over 1.7 million people across our nation or about 3.5 million
including indirect employment. These individuals and the companies they
work for represent a key part of American entrepreneurship and
innovation, maintaining the United States as the world leader in the
defense and aerospace sectors and helping ensure our armed forces
sustain their military edge.

[Under the AECA, there are three main authorities through which the
United States can provide defense articles or services to another
country: government-to-government Foreign Military Sales
(FMS)]{.underline}; [licensed exports of direct commercial sales (DCS);
and the lease of defense articles. We are also authorized to provide EDA
under the FAA and to approve third-party transfer requests under both
the AECA and the FAA.]{.underline}

A variety of regulations apply to these programs. [On the FMS side,
government-to-government sales are implemented by the Department of
Defense, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement apply to all programs]{.underline}.
Admiral Rixey will address this in more detail. [On the DCS side, my
Bureau manages the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR),
which implements part of Section 38 of the AECA, authorizing the
President to control the export, temporary import, and brokering of
defense articles and defense services. Permanent imports of defense
articles pursuant to section 38 of the AECA are regulated by the
Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives.]{.underline}

The ITAR includes the United States Munitions List (USML) -- 21 broad
categories into which defense articles and services may fall, ranging
from small arms to naval vessels, fighter jets, and satellites. The
export of articles and services enumerated on the USML are regulated by
the Department of State, through the Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls (DDTC).

While I will speak in greater detail about exports under the ITAR, it is
important to note that the AECA requires every person who engages in the
business of manufacturing, exporting, or importing defense articles or
defense services to register with the Department of State. The ITAR
implements this statutory requirement and clarifies that a "manufacturer
who does not engage in exporting must nevertheless register." This
requirement, according to the ITAR, "is primarily a means to provide the
U.S. government with necessary information on who is involved in certain
manufacturing and exporting activities."

Finally, [regardless of whether an article or service is being
transferred via FMS, DCS, Lease, EDA, or third-party transfer, we have a
policy framework through which we review every arms transfer on a
case-by-case basis.]{.underline} This is the Conventional Arms Transfer
(CAT) Policy, a Presidential-level policy last updated in 2014. The CAT
policy identifies 13 considerations we must examine in reviewing each
sale or export:

Let me now walk through the processes by which the United States may
transfer or authorize the export of arms.

The first is [Direct Commercial Sales. Generally in a DCS case, a
foreign entity -- be it a government, a corporation, or an individual --
works directly with a partner in the U.S. defense industrial base to
obtain equipment or services.]{.underline} [Neither the U.S. military
nor the U.S. government is directly involved in the sale]{.underline} or
acquisition[. If the articles or services in question constitute defense
articles or defense services, as defined by the U.S. Munitions List and
the ITAR, the State Department must authorize the transaction through a
license or other form of approval.]{.underline} All such applications
are reviewed under the CAT policy and other statutes or regulations as
appropriate, and may include interagency review to ensure U.S. interests
are properly protected. [Depending on the nature of the transaction, the
Department may convene an interagency working group to formulate policy
recommendations on whether to grant the license or other form of
approval.]{.underline} The composition of this group varies, but the
main players include the Department and DoD. [If the value of the
license exceeds the levels identified in the AECA, the Department must
notify the proposed license to Congress]{.underline}. Following State
Department review, and, if required, the successful conclusion of
Congressional notification, the Department may issue a license or
otherwise approve the transaction.

The second major process is the FMS process. [In FMS, a foreign country
contracts with DoD to provide a defense article from stock or through a
DoD purchase from the U.S. defense industry]{.underline}. In practice,
[this process constitutes several steps:]{.underline}

[Letter of Request (LOR) from the foreign partner]{.underline}. LORs can
be vague, referencing simply an overall capability required, or they can
lay out in detail a proposed procurement. LORs, which can be received
via many channels, are processed by DSCA and turned into draft Letters
of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), which provide far more detail, including
cost. LOAs -- [once fully approved with the U.S. government and accepted
by the foreign government -- ultimately constitute an agreement between
the partner and the United States Government.]{.underline}

The draft LOA is provided by DSCA to the State Department, where we
review the case under the statutory, regulatory, and policy frameworks
identified above. While processing times can vary depending on the
circumstances of individual proposed sales, the State FMS review process
is an efficient one. [State reviews and adjudicates FMS sales offers on
a daily basis, typically providing its assent in all but a small
minority of cases.]{.underline}

If the LOA is above monetary thresholds established in the AECA, we must
notify the case to Congress before the sale can be approved.

Once the Department has approved the sale, DSCA may offer the LOA to the
partner country. Its signature on the LOA is contractually binding. DoD
then implements the case.

Beyond being a government-to-government process, FMS differs from DCS in
several key ways. The first is in economy-of-scale buying power. [When
buying through the U.S. military, a country may be able to leverage a
purchase that a particular Military Service is already buying for its
own use to get a cheaper unit price than they would
otherwise.]{.underline} Alternatively, the country may be able to pool
with the purchase of another country that is also working within the FMS
process. This provides benefit to our Military Services and promotes our
ability to build meaningful partner capacity overseas.

Another reason a country might choose to use FMS is that it may not have
the capability or capacity within its government to effectively oversee
the acquisition, so they are paying DoD to do it for them. DoD provides
contracting support, requirements evaluation, logistics support, and
works directly with the U.S. supplier. As the exporting party in a
Foreign Military Sales case is the United States Government, [FMS sales
are exempt from the requirement for export licenses]{.underline}.

[FMS provides what is called "the total package approach," which
includes the aforementioned services as well as sustainment, technical
support, training, and software/hardware updates.]{.underline} The total
package approach may make an FMS purchase more appear more expensive on
the front end, but the country is receiving much more than a defense
article.

Finally, there are many countries that appreciate the transparency that
comes with the U.S. system. For them, demonstrating to its public that
the acquisition is free of corruption is a significant selling point of
the FMS system.

There are advantages, as well, to purchasing through DCS. DCS is not
subject to the DoD acquisition process, and thus allows another country
to set its own standards for competitions and negotiate directly with
the U.S. defense industry. [DCS may at times be faster, and might also
prove better for acquiring items not purchased by the U.S. military for
its own needs.]{.underline}

As a general matter of policy, the U.S. government takes a "neutral"
position on whether a customer selects FMS vs. DCS although [there are
some systems which, because of technological or policy sensitivity, we
only sell via FMS]{.underline}. The important element is that partners
buy American; the mechanism through which they do so is typically their
choice.

I would like to conclude by discussing two essential aspects of U.S.
arms transfers: end use monitoring and compliance.

[End-use monitoring (EUM) refers to the steps we take to ensure that
defense articles or services we have provided are used, secured, and
accounted for]{.underline}, consistent with section 40(a) of the AECA,
our license terms, and in accordance with our agreements with the
foreign government or international organizations. Section 40A requires
an EUM program for defense articles and defense services sold, leased,
or exported under the AECA or the FAA that is designed to provide
reasonable assurance that i) the recipient is complying with the
requirements imposed by the United States Government with respect to
use, transfers, and security of defense articles and defense services;
and ii) such articles and services are being used for the purposes for
which they are provided."

The U.S. government has three EUM programs for defense articles,
technology, or services. EUM for USML articles and services exported via
DCS is implemented via DDTC's Blue Lantern program. Blue Lantern's
mission is to help ensure the security and integrity of U.S. defense
trade. Blue Lantern helps prevent the diversion and unauthorized use of
U.S. defense articles exported through DCS, combats gray arms
trafficking, uncovers violations of the AECA, and builds confidence and
cooperation among defense trade partners. Blue Lantern end-use
monitoring includes pre-license, post-license, and post-shipment checks
to verify the bona fides of foreign consignees and end-users, to confirm
the legitimacy of proposed transactions, and to verify compliance with
U.S. defense export rules and policies. Blue Lantern checks are
typically conducted by U.S. embassy and consulate staff in over 100
countries every year. An unfavorable Blue Lantern determination may
result in the denial or revocation of a license, entry on DDTC's Watch
List, or, if there is evidence of possible criminal activity, referral
to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) or the FBI.

[For FMS cases, EUM is conducted via DSCA's Golden Sentry
program.]{.underline} The principal components of Golden Sentry's
execution include obtaining pre-delivery end-user assurances from the
recipient governments and international organizations regarding
authorized end-use, re-transfer restrictions, and protection of
U.S.-origin defense equipment. Routine and Enhanced end-use monitoring
by security cooperation organizations assigned to U.S. embassies
worldwide verify end-use, accountability, and security of defense
articles and services. Compliance Assessment Visits performed by the EUM
Division personnel are also central to the Golden Sentry program. Golden
Sentry personnel from DSCA verify compliance with the end-use terms and
conditions of sale and other transfer agreements.

#### Violation -- 

#### Vote Negative --

#### The impact is clash -- debates about scholarship in a vacuum are myopic and breed reactionary fact based arguments -- their roll of the ballot allows the AFF to cement their prep advantage into an undefeatable position since it lets them win as long as they used their infinite prep time to find quality evidence supporting an ideological orientation. The real controversy isn't the problem, it's the solution, which is why disadvantages based on their praxis are incredibly important -- this wrecks neg ground and the foundation for good debates. 

#### This outweighs their standards -- the process of clash bolsters advocacy and is a prerequisite to meaningful debates 

**Talisse, Vanderbilt philosophy professor, 2005** \[Robert,
"Deliberativist responses to activist challenges", Philosophy & Social
Criticism, 31.4, Project Muse, Date Accessed: 7/14/15, ACS\]

It may seem that we have reached an impasse. However, there is a further
line of criticism that the activist must face. To the activist's view
that at least in certain situations he may reasonably decline to engage
with persons he disagrees with (107), the deliberative democrat can
raise the phenomenon that Cass Sunstein has called 'group
polarization' (Sunstein, 2003; 2001a: ch. 3; 2001b: ch. 1). To explain:
consider that political activists cannot eschew deliberation altogether;
they often engage in rallies, demonstrations, teach-ins, workshops, and
other activities in which they are called to make public the case for
their views. [Activists also must engage in
deliberation]{.underline} among themselves [when deciding
strategy.]{.underline} Political [movements must be organized,
hence]{.underline} those involved must decide
upon [targets]{.underline}, methods, [and tactics]{.underline}; they
must also decide upon the content of their pamphlets and the precise
messages they most wish to convey to the press. Often the audience in
both of these deliberative contexts will be a self-selected and
sympathetic group of like-minded activists. Group polarization is a
well-documented phenomenon that has 'been found all over the world and
in many diverse tasks'; it means that 'members of a deliberating group
predictably move towards a more extreme point in the direction indicated
by the members' predeliberation tendencies' (Sunstein, 2003: 81--2).
Importantly, in groups that 'engage in repeated discussions' over time,
the polarization is even more pronounced (2003: 86). Hence [discussion
in a]{.underline} small but [devoted activist enclave]{.underline} that
meets regularly to strategize and protest '[should produce a situation
in which individuals hold positions more extreme]{.underline} than
those[ ]{.underline}of any individual member [before
the]{.underline} series of [deliberations]{.underline} began' (ibid.).17
The fact of group polarization is relevant to our discussion
because the activist has proposed that he may reasonably decline to
engage in discussion with those with whom he disagrees in cases in
which the requirements of justice are so clear[ ]{.underline}that he can
be confident that he has the truth. Group polarization suggests that
deliberatively [confronting those with whom we disagree is essential
even when we have the truth]{.underline}. For even if we have the
truth, [if we do not]{.underline} [engage opposing views]{.underline},
[but instead deliberate only with those with whom we
agree]{.underline}, [our view will shift]{.underline} progressively [to
a more extreme point, and thus we lose the truth. In order to avoid
polarization]{.underline}, [deliberation must take place within
heterogeneous 'argument pools']{.underline} (Sunstein, 2003: 93). This
of course does not mean that there should be no groups devoted to the
achievement of some common political goal; it rather suggests
that [engagement with those with whom one disagrees is
essential]{.underline} to the proper pursuit of justice. Insofar as the
activist denies this, he is unreasonable.

## Neg Extensions

### Impact -- Advocacy Skills

#### Debate provides a space for the development of portable skills -- that's the only thing that can solve their impacts out of round given that decisionmaking is inevitable

- debating helps us change the world -- advocacy skills are the best
  internal link to changing governmental policy

- but, only rules can facilitate good debate

- decisionmaking and mediating options is inevitable, which means it's
  only a question of us getting better at that task

- but, we're not asking you to roleplay as the government

- and debate is good---listical

[In modern democratic societies, the right to debate is a priceless
asset. **It enables any citizen to propose a better plan of action than
the one that the ruling power sets forth. If the speaker can convince
enough citizens that the new idea is a better one, then the speaker can
change the policy of the city, county, state, or even
nation.**]{.underline}

In the United States, [there are various ways in which the effective
speaker can propose a new solution to a problem. One way, for instance,
is to persuade a number of people to sign a petition to put a proposal
on the ballot in an election. Then the proponents can speak to the
voters on behalf of the proposal and perhaps convince a suf ficient
number of them of the need to vote it into law. They will undoubtedly
meet outspoken opposition if they attempt to use this method of
expressing their opinions, and it is essential that they know what to do
in this kind of debating situation. By the same token**, a good speaker
can defend the present system, or status quo, by opposing unsound
ideas**]{.underline}. [We are accustomed to the formal debating done by
members of legislative bodies such as the Senate or the House of
Representatives. In these houses, **elaborate guidelines are laid out to
ensure adherence to the two basic rules of debate: (1) present one issue
at a time, and (2) provide equal opportunity for presentation of each
viewpoint.**]{.underline}

The committee system in the U.S. Congress, for example, makes it
possible to begin debate on a bill even before it reaches the floor. But
whether it is debated in a committee hearing (with the committee as
judges) or on the floor of one of the two houses, the same basic
principles are involved.

You may not be particularly conscious of the fact that debate occurs in
every walk of life, not only in congresses. Actually, **[every situation
in which you are asked to compare alternatives is one that forces you to
debate the merits of those alternatives]{.underline}**. [Sometimes you
will do the debating within yourself, as when you must decide whether to
attend college. Sometimes the debating is done in your presence by
others, with you as the judge, as in the case of rival sales
presentations, each of which asks you to buy their particular product.
Often we fail to recognize the debate situation because only one person
is speaking to us---the single salesperson in a store, for
instance---but usually that person reveals the true nature of the debate
by acting as if there were actually a third person present with you.
Such phrases as "You may be thinking that this would be expensive, but .
. . " are signs of an awareness on the sellers' part that they must
refute arguments that can be brought against their proposal by one part
of your "self" so that the judge part of your self will decide in their
favor.]{.underline}

[**Therefore the debating you do now can be a great help to you all your
life**. And **you don't have to be a lawyer or member of Congress to use
debating skills**.]{.underline}

The Advantages for You

Since the first formal intercollegiate debate in the United States
(between Harvard and Yale in 1892), hundreds of thousands, perhaps even
millions, of American high school and college students have participated
in academic debate. [Woodrow Wilson engaged in debating as a student at
Princeton long before he became president of that university, governor
of his state, and fi- nally president of the United States. Presidents
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, and Clinton are recent examples of
national figures who participated in debating during student
days]{.underline}. But you can spend four or even eight school years in
debating and come out with little benefit unless you know what it is you
are trying to do and what it is you are trying to learn. The Debater's
Guide is dedicated to two closely related ideas: first, that you cannot
do a job well unless you know what the job is and, second, that you can
never fully understand the job unless you are able to do it well.
Therefore, you will find, [the advantages of debate]{.underline} for you
[coincide exactly with the virtues of an ideal debater:]{.underline}

**[1. The ability to collect and organize ideas]{.underline}**. A
successful debate speaker is one who can absorb vast amounts of material
and select from it those items that are the best to use in a particular
debate.

**[2. The ability to subordinate ideas. A debater will hear about forty-
five hundred to five thousand words from the opponents during a typical
single round of debate]{.underline}**. [Together with a colleague, this
debater will deliver an additional forty- five hundred to five thousand
words. **Only by sorting out the major ideas from the minor ones can any
speaker hope to make sense of this flood of words**.]{.underline}

**[3. The ability to evaluate evidence. Skill in gleaning the most
important evidence is a hallmark of an intelligent speaker. Not every
statement, quotation, statistic, or idea in a debate is worth the
trouble of refutation]{.underline}**.

**[4. The ability to see logical connections]{.underline}**. Aristotle
once pointed out [that the ability to see what is similar among
dissimilar things is a mark of genius. **The great mass of data
presented during most debates causes confusion among the hearers;
therefore the speakers who can identify the relationship between items
help to clarify the debate for the audience and thus improve their own
chances of success.**]{.underline}

[5. The ability to think and speak in outline terms. Clarity is
essential in a debate (and in any good communication, for that matter),
during which the clash of ideas often confuses an audience. The debaters
must have not only a perfectly clear mental outline of their entire case
but also the ability to communicate the sense of that outline to the
audience.]{.underline}

[6. The ability to speak convincingly. An awareness of what an audience
expects---what it takes to convince that particular audience---is
absolutely essential, both in debate and in other types of
speaking.]{.underline}

[7. The ability to adapt. Since a debate is a fluid situation,
constantly changing as new ideas are introduced by various speakers, it
places a premium on readiness of reply. In practice, this readiness
means that you must be not only well organized, logical, analytic, and
convincing but also able to react to new ideas quickly]{.underline}.

### Impact -- Limits

#### Limits -- large topics overwhelm researchers which either causes outsourcing for large squads or individuals to quit

Learning: An Integrated Model for Educational Game Design",

MOTIVATION

To motivate is to "provide with an incentive[". To motivate someone to
learn is to provide them with an incentive to engage in the act of
gaining knowledge. In traditional instructional design practice,
motivation is often considered as a preliminary step in the
instructional process]{.underline} \[2\].

[Intrinsic motivation in learning, however, focuses on the development
of **motivation throughout the entire instructional process**. Though
traditional instructional design practice focuses on a less integrated
approach, developing life-long learners who are intrinsically motivated,
display intellectual curiosity, find learning enjoyable, and continue
seeking knowledge after their formal instruction has ended has always
**been a major goal of education**]{.underline} \[17\].

[Looking at the 'effort' expelled during the learning process will help
determine whether learners are motivated.]{.underline} However, [for
'effort' to even occur, there are two necessary prerequisites required:
(1) the person must value the task and (2) **the person must believe he
or she can succeed at the task.**]{.underline} In any given
instructional situation, the learning task needs to be presented in a
way that is engaging and meaningful to the student, **[and in a way that
promotes positive expectations for the successful achievement of
learning objectives]{.underline}** \[17\]. To help understand motivation
in instruction we can look at the ARCS Model of Motivational Design as
developed by John M. Keller of Florida State University \[9\]. The ARCS
Model identifies four essential strategy components for motivating
instruction:

> \[A\]ttention strategies for arousing and sustaining curiosity and
> interest.
>
> \- Learners are more motivated when the instructional design generates
> curiosity and interest about the content or learning context.
>
> \[R\]elevance strategies that link to learners\' needs, interests, and
> motives.
>
> \- Learners are more motivated when goals are clearly defined and
> align with learners' interests.
>
> \[C\]onfidence strategies that help students develop a positive
> expectation for successful achievement.
>
> \- [Learners are more motivated when challenge is balanced in such a
> way that the learning process is neither too easy as to bore the
> leaner, **or too difficult such that success seems
> impossible.**]{.underline}
>
> \[S\]atisfaction strategies that provide extrinsic and intrinsic
> reinforcement for effort.
>
> \- Learners are more motivated when there are rewards for correctly
> executed actions.

### Impact -- Scenario Planning 

#### **Scenario planning is good**

**The Economist, 19**

\[The Economist, 7/6/19, "Why it's worth reading crazy-sounding
scenarios about the future"
[https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/07/06/why-its-worth-reading-crazy-sounding-scenarios-about-the-future
accessed
7-1-19](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/07/06/why-its-worth-reading-crazy-sounding-scenarios-about-the-future%20accessed%207-1-19)
dwrs\]

[Predicting the future is hard. But preparing for its
uncertainties,]{.underline} while you lie on the beach, [can at least be
entertaining. It can also broaden the mind and subtly change your
understanding of the present]{.underline}. Rather than the Great
American Novel or a tall stack of chick-lit bonkbusters (see our
Obituary on Judith Krantz), we propose a different sort of summer
reading. **[Speculating about the future, even if it is far-fetched, can
help people and institutions cope with what comes next. For the best
material, here are three places to look.]{.underline}**

[The first is scenario planning.]{.underline} This originated in the
armed forces during the second world war and was pioneered in industry
by Royal Dutch Shell, enabling it to react more quickly and effectively
than rival oil firms to the oil shock of 1973[. The central idea was to
avoid betting everything on a single forecast and instead to test future
projects and plans against a set of plausible scenarios. Mapping out
several futures, deciding how to respond to them and identifying the
early signs that they might be coming about has been widely adopted by
multinational firms, particularly after the terrorist attacks of
September 11th 2001. In that spirit, we publish our own annual set of
speculative scenarios,]{.underline} "The World If", in this week's
edition. [What if America leaves nato, or antibiotics stop working, or
Facebook switches itself off in Europe? These things may never happen,
but it is mind-stretching to think about what you should do if they
did.]{.underline}

Science fiction, a second realm of speculation, is perhaps a more
familiar beach read. [It is wrong to see sci-fi as chiefly predictive,
however. Its contemplation of the future is often a commentary on the
present: many sci-fi authors take current concerns, from robots to
climate chaos to gender politics, to the logical extremes and consider
their implications]{.underline}. As a result, [sci-fi can play a useful
role as a forward-scanning radar for technological, social and political
trends. But sci-fi does directly shape the future in one concrete way:
the tech industry is full of people trying to make it come
true.]{.underline} [Amazon's Alexa voice-assistant is the talking
computer from "Star Trek"; SpaceX lands its rockets on drone ships whose
names are borrowed from Iain M. Banks's "Culture" novels; an entire
industry is trying to bring to life the virtual world of Neal
Stephenson's "Snow Crash]{.underline}". Beyond these familiar tropes,
Chinese sci-fi and Afrofuturism offer refreshingly different
perspectives and possibilities.

[The last speculative category is corporate anthropology and
trendspotting.]{.underline} Many large companies employ roving
anthropologists [to seek out "edge cases": examples of emerging
technologies and behaviour that have yet to become widely adopted, but
have the potential to go global.]{.underline} As the sci-fi novelist
William Gibson once put it, "[the future is already here---it's just
unevenly distributed." Two decades ago, Japanese schoolgirls led the way
with modern smartphones, capable of taking pictures and downloading
apps; **we are all Japanese schoolgirls now**. What's next: the death of
cash? Clothes made of mushrooms? Artificial meat? Trendspotters often
get it wrong. But it is worth paying attention to what they think might
be coming, just in case they are right]{.underline}.

The rewards of speculation

Pierre Wack, one of the gurus of scenario planning at Shell, once
likened dealing with the future to shooting the rapids in a boat. [You
know the general direction of travel, but not the exact path, and the
trick is to be able to respond quickly. Reading about possible futures
can shift your perception of the present and help you understand what
might be around the corner. It can also be fun. So why not give it a
try, starting with the speculative scenarios in this issue: who knows
what might happen?]{.underline}

### Impact -- Existential Risk

#### The chaos of the Trump administration means that now is uniquely key -- debates over foreign policy solve existential risk

[There are plenty of reasons to argue that the US should adopt a grand
strategy of restraint, offshore balancing, progressive internationalism,
or non-intervention as alternatives to the prior status quo in US
foreign policy. **Rather than having this debate or even taking a clear
stance, the Trump administration has instead enacted a foreign policy
that,**]{.underline} as Jeanne Morefield put it, ["reflects, like a
funhouse mirror, a twisted image of U.S. imperialism."]{.underline} The
US has always supported some dictatorships and decried others, for
instance, but [Trump does not give the ideological or strategic
reasoning once offered, but instead goes off his gut and those around
him (e.g. decrying Venezuela as socialist while praising the leader of
North Korea).]{.underline}

[Hence we get Jared Kushner's palling around with Saudi Prince Muhammad
bin Salman affecting policy toward Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle
East, or aggressive policy toward Venezuela shaped by a personal White
House meeting and Venezuelans visiting Trump's golf clubs. This gives
space to hawkish advisers like Rubio and Bolton to push their agendas,
absent bigger questions about how approaches to specific relationships
or crises affect US interests elsewhere, and what collateral effects
they may have globally, something that had clearly negative effects in
the undermining of the Iran nuclear deal.]{.underline} As Elizabeth
Saunders' work discusses, **[when presidents lack experience in foreign
policy, as Trump does, they are easily manipulated by
advisers]{.underline}**. Between Trump's impulsiveness and his
surrounding neoconservative advisers, **[chaos seems the only reasonable
prediction for US foreign policy over the next two to six
years.]{.underline}**

[I write this]{.underline} not as a hot-take jeremiad against Trump's
foreign policy, but rather **[to highlight that in the absence of
strategic vision in this administration, there lies an opportunity and
an imperative for scholars and activists who seek to move US foreign
policy and grand strategy in new directions to develop their ideas and
push them further into the public sphere and political
discourse.]{.underline}** Or follow Daniel Bessner's call and **[take
over think tank spaces and the government!]{.underline}** Much of this
work is already ongoing (I've quoted or cited many publicly-engaged
scholars here), but this week provided a very stark reminder of the
state of play and the stakes of the game heading into 2020 and beyond.

Favorable effects of news content political cynicism and voter behavior

While unfavorable effects of media content have been studied
extensively, only recently has there been attention given to the
favorable effects of media content. [News coverage that may have
favorable effects is substantive news content, also called issue news.
Substantive news content provides information about **present and future
government policy**, about the political stances of parties and about
ideologies and ideas]{.underline} (Van Praag and Van der Eijk, 1998).
While [strategic news may remind citizens about the strategies political
actors pursue in order to win votes, substantive news may remind
citizens about the **issues political actors try to solve** and about
their societal goals and viewpoints. **For this reason, substantive news
may reduce cynicism and induce turnout, while strategic news may induce
cynicism and reduce turnout.**]{.underline}

Some [evidence points in this direction]{.underline}: Adriaansen et al.
(2010) linked [content analysis data to survey data and indeed found a
negative relationship between substantive news and political
cynicism]{.underline}, specifically [among young citizens]{.underline}.
We conclude that the evidence is limited but cautiously hypothesize that
**[substantive news content reduces cynicism (H2a) and induces turnout
intention (H2b).]{.underline}**

- even if they're right about some power, they're not right about all of
  it -- power as transformative capacity can be good and grounded in
  material interests

- only in the democratizing influence of our politics can break down
  hierarchical organizations

- but, debate is good as a confidence building exercise in which we
  allow people to take control of their lives -- and, we have empirical
  evidence

- progress is possible

- sometimes the state does good things and a policy change is desirable

- and that means it's possible to harness the power of state
  institutions for 'good'

- but, even movements have an endgoal of government change

- abandoning political power allows the right to fill In which is worse

- working to reform doesn't trade off with any emancipatory political
  movements, and actually it whets the appetite for more reform

Sharing Knowledge

For Wainwright, these **[movements "illustrated, in the way they
organized, how this tacit knowledge might be shared... they are capable
of purposeful and planned action, through collaboration and without
predictive certainty, constantly subject to further experiment and
self-reflexivity"]{.underline}** (p. 8-9). [She contrasts the paternal
concept of "power as domination," where political leaders tell people
what they need and then implement it, **with "power as transformative
capacity," where policy ideas and implementation come from the everyday
knowledge of those most impacted.**]{.underline}

Wainwright [notes the utilization of "power as transformative capacity"
growing]{.underline} in Britain out of feminist movements, [as well as
community organizations,]{.underline} in the 1960s. **[Instead of having
a governing party do something on their behalf, these groups engaged in
action with its own directly transformative capacity. They rejected
traditional deference to authority, and sought to democratize knowledge,
"breaking from models that presume an expert leadership and more or less
ignorant membership," and emphasizing popular education]{.underline}**
(p. 19). **[The collective self-confidence of people to take control of
the conditions of their lives]{.underline}** has also, according to
Wainwright, [played out within the Labour Party itself, such as the 1945
government, and again in 1973]{.underline} -- though in ambiguous,
contradictory, and temporary ways. The relationship between bottom up
change and existing political institutions is explored more fully as the
book develops.

Wainwright powerfully illustrates the sort of positive political project
she is advocating through three key examples. She describes the push [in
the 1970s by Lucas Aerospace workers who, facing massive job cutbacks
and restructuring, developed a detailed plan to nationalize and
reconfigure the company toward applying the technology for socially
useful purposes. While the plan received the support of then-Industry
Secretary Tony Benn, corporate pressure and the 1979 defeat of Labour
meant it was never implemented.]{.underline}

[She also describes the successful pushback by Newcastle municipal IT
workers in 1999 when the City Council considered contracting their work
to a private firm. They successfully campaigned against privatization,
and instead created an alternative strategy to improve the service based
on maximizing public benefit. Finally, Wainwright looks at the growth of
digital space, and its utilization to create new democratic spaces, such
as 'platform co-operatives' as an alternative to the 'platform
capitalism' of companies like Uber.]{.underline}

These examples work to illustrate how **[positive alternatives to
neoliberalism can be developed from a bottom up, participatory capacity,
through everyday shared knowledge. More than just resisting, these
examples developed new forms of social relations beyond austerity and
market logic]{.underline}**. Wainwright's examples are well chosen, in
particular her discussion of democratic digital spaces is a refreshing
counter note to the abhorrent tech ventures of Silicon Valley, which
continually find new ways to use technology to further exploit and
profit from the most vulnerable.

Role of the State

One point I would like to raise about these examples though, is that
they all sought to turn the state into a positive ally. In the remainder
of the book, Wainwright argues that to develop 'power as transformative
capacity', **[the state's 'power as domination' is a necessary condition
for its full realization]{.underline}**. I agree with Wainwright **[that
state institutions can be used, "where the balance of political power is
favourable, to pursue social goals]{.underline}**" (p. 76). I think it
is [important to work to elect left governments that will enable social
transformation]{.underline}. That being said, **[positive
transformational change is also possible through a more adversarial
approach with state actors.]{.underline}** [Moreover, sometimes it is
necessary.]{.underline}

Not all issues can be won through electoral victory. Moreover, [many
marginalized communities have distrustful relations with the state (for
good reason), and are not interested in producing change through
engaging state institutions, but instead wish to emancipate themselves
from such systemically oppressive institutions. Movements, instead of
"occupying the institutions," may choose rather to confront
institutional actors and force institutions to change**. I am thinking
of movements such as those seeking indigenous sovereignty. I am thinking
of groups such as Black Lives Matter, who have sought to transform
policing institutions through direct confrontation with those in power.
These groups have been able to create positive change without winning
government as an ally, but by using the power of their movement to force
change. Social movements should not see winning institutions of power as
a necessary condition for creating larger social change.**]{.underline}

**[That being said, I do believe in a diversity of strategy, and taking
government power where possible]{.underline}**. And as I noted at the
beginning of this review, **[the right has been capitalizing on distrust
of elites and technocratic politics in order to bring in politicians
seeking austerity budgets and police states, which the left has been
largely unable to counter.]{.underline}**

Corbyn and the Labour Party

Wainwright concludes the book by looking at Jeremy Corbyn's victory in
the Labour Party leadership, and the upset 2017 UK election. For
Wainwright, Corbyn, "as an activist in many different struggles,
symbolized a new effort from below to open the party to radical change,
through his modesty and daily support for others in struggle" (p. 113).
Corbyn's victory opened the Labour Party to movements and groups that
had long been excluded, particularly in the era of New Labour. It has
given them the opportunity to radically transform and democratize the
party. Whether that struggle will be successful, according to
Wainwright, depends on how the parliamentary party apparatus will move
to support him, and whether Momentum and the radical elements of the
Labour Party can [simultaneously reform the party and engage in wider
social transformation.]{.underline} The Labour Party must reject the
traditional divide between political institutions and social actors on
the outside.

The opening of the Labour Party represented by Corbyn's victory speaks
to exactly the sort of large scale radical, open politics that
Wainwright is hoping for. **[The bottom-up social alternatives he
offered, and invited people to participate in, helped create the
groundswell of support that has led to his success.]{.underline}**
Critically, his support base is largely not committed to the Labour
Party, nor, as Wainwright notes, should they be. [**In this case the
party has acted as a vehicle for constructing a larger alternative
social vision**, in the same spirit as the Lucas Plan, Newcastle IT
workers, or digital co-operatives. **Working within traditional
political institutions such as the Labour Party may seem like anathema
to many social movements on the left, particularly those most interested
in bottom up politics that seeks to decentralize and reimagine power
relations.**]{.underline} However, as Wainwright convincingly argues
through her examination of Corbyn's victory, **[there is great potential
in engaging with these systems. This is not to say that one must (or
should) throw their full support into advancing the party
cause]{.underline}**, as Wainwright points out. But as the Corbyn
example shows, **[strategic engagement at opportune moments can do much
to advance "power as transformative capacity," without necessarily
capitulating to traditional power structures.]{.underline}**

### Rules Good

#### The political is the ability to appear before equals in an attempt to build a better world -- plurality is inevitable, but only adherence to common affairs can form the space in between -- the process of contestation and disagreement means that we don't seek an objective truth but a politically contingent one -- the inevitability of chaos is THE uniqueness which necessitates a human convention, and that's a good thing -- flight from institutions is reinventing the wheel which incites constant revolutionary cannibalism because every organization will have flaws

Arendt". http://gendocs.ru/docs/37/36046/conv_1/file1.pdf 5/13. dwrs.\]

Politics, plurality and the public world

[Hannah Arendt]{.underline} assumed that there was a priority and
autonomy to politics. She did not believe that the public and private
sphere were entirely unrelated. But she argued that there are distinct
principles and motives for political action. Unlike others such as
Schmitt (1996a) who also [believed in the distinctiveness of 'the
political', the ultimate expression of Arendt's idea of politics is not
violent conflict, a struggle to the death between enemies. **It is the
ability to appear before plural equals and to debate and act to build a
common world.** Arendt understood political action to be identical with
the freedom to act with plural others to bring something new into the
world. Indeed, **this plurality, she argued, is 'specifically the
condition ... of all political life'**]{.underline} (1958: 7).

[The existence of plurality, that there are many perspectives and voices
that constitute the political world, **is an objective fact**. When
plural equals come together to debate their common affairs we can say
that a public realm has been created. Through speech and action this
plurality of people form a 'space in-between' **them which can exist
'without the intermediary of things or matter'**]{.underline} (1958: 7).
[There is an important revelatory dimension to political action in
Arendt's thought. Through acting and speaking in public men and women
can reveal something about themselves that they would not otherwise have
known. They can discover 'who' they are, a particular self that would
not be possible in the absence of such constitutive action]{.underline}.
Some have mistakenly suggested that Arendt's emphasis on speech and the
public realm makes her an early thinker in the tradition of critical
theory advanced by Jürgen Habermas (Habermas 1983; Benhabib 1996).
However, **[Arendt's emphasis on contestation and disagreement, her
acceptance of the contingency of all politically-relevant truth claims,
is at odds with Habermas' focus on deliberative rationality and
consensus-building]{.underline}** (Canovan 1983).

When Arendt wrote about the political, public world, or the republic,
she had something very specific in mind. [The world is literally the
space for politics and it is for the sake of this world, out of a
concern for its continuance, those with public spirit often
act.]{.underline} In The Human Condition, Arendt identified a number of
[modern trends contributing to the destruction of our sense of a
distinctly public world. She was extremely critical of any use of
Christian principles as the basis for political action, such as
compassion, love, or charity. She was highly critical of efforts to make
issues of 'the self' and concern for the 'life processes' of individuals
the central concern of politics. The results,]{.underline} Arendt
believed, [were disastrous; 'the linkage of politics and life results in
an inner contradiction that cancels and destroys what is specifically
political about politics']{.underline} (2005: 145). This element of
Arendt's thought overlaps with the realist-republican tradition
associated with Machiavelli, of politics as an artificial 'space of
appearances' (Owens, 2007a, 2008a). We find that Arendt was an important
forerunner of those concerned with the rise of 'biopolitics', which has
recently become popular through the appropriation of the writing of
Arendt and Foucault (Agamben 1998; Kinsella 2008/9; Owens 2008/9).

Arendt was a theorist of new political beginnings and the founding of
new political spaces. New beginnings were always possible, she argued,
given the fact of natality, the ontological root of political action.
Humans 'are not born in order to die but in order to begin' (1958: 246).
However, although political action can have a definite beginning it can
never have a predictable end. The effort to control or predict is always
overrun by the nature of political action, 'where nothing happens more
frequently than the totally unexpected' (1958: 300). This is one of the
reasons that she argued, contra Marx and others, that the most
significant changes in social and political life could not be understood
through the projection of continuous historical laws (for Arendt's
'theory of theory' see Luban (1983)). History is the product of events
brought into being by the actions of men and women; here 'accident and
infinite improbability occurs' all the time (1968c: 170).

**[The contingency, boundless instability and unpredictability of
political action make law and territorial boundaries important. Without
such conventions the world would, indeed, be little more than a
Hobbesian state of nature]{.underline}**, as neo-realist international
theory suggests, or [more accurately, in Arendt's words, a desert, a
'lawless, fenceless wilderness of fear and suspicion']{.underline}
(1966: 466). **[In the absence of such laws the 'space in-between' that
emerges through political interaction would seem so
ephemeral]{.underline}**. [Arendt's account here has been described as
loosely compatible with a pluralist international society
approach]{.underline} (Williams 2005). However, it must be remembered
that Arendt never identified the 'comity of nations' or so-called
'society of European states' as embodying potentially universal and
abstract norms that could be divorced from force and imperial power
(Owens 2007a). Her writing was anti-nationalist and non-statist. In a
1945 essay, 'The Seeds of a Fascist International', she wrote that 'the
"national state", having lost its very foundations, leads a life of a
walking corpse, whose spurious existence is artificially prolonged by
repeated injections of imperialist expansion' (1994: 143).

The traumas of the twentieth-century demonstrated to Arendt that 'human
dignity' needed 'a new guarantee' (1966: ix). But she was extremely
ambivalent about the liberal discourse of human rights (Beardsworth
2008). Indeed of all the political theories that might appropriate
various elements of Arendt's thought the one least likely to do so is
liberalism. 'All the so-called liberal concepts of politics,' she
observed, 'simply add up private lives and personal behavior patterns
and present the sum as laws of history, or economics, or politics ...
they express the bourgeoisie's instinctive distrust of and its innate
hostility to public affairs' (1966: 145--46). With the exception of a
few passages in Origins, she hardly referred to human rights. Instead,
she favoured the categories of action, opinions, freedom and plurality
to refer to the politics in which rights would make sense (Isaac 1996).
Arendt did not malign 'human rights' as such and a number of her
interpreters (Cotter 2005; Birmingham 2006; Parekh 2008) have developed
her writing on 'a right to have rights', 'to live in a framework where
one is judged by one's actions and opinions' (1966: 296--97; see Cotter,
2005; Birmingham, 2006; Parekh, 2008). Isaac (2002) suggests that even
if human rights justifications for military intervention are
hypocritical, as was the case when NATO intervened in Kosovo in 1999,
Arendt provides reasons for not condemning such wars on these grounds,
though Owens (2007a) criticises this claim. Arendt had a distinctive
response to genocide, or what she called a 'war of annihilation' (2005;
Owens 2008a).

[The most important rights, according to Arendt, **are political rights
which are wholly dependent on human conventions not any abstract inborn
human dignity**. The only guarantee of human dignity after the disasters
of the twentieth-century was a new form of political founding, which she
conceived in terms of a post-national democratic-republican model of
interlinked polities]{.underline} (Rensmann 2007). This is a modest
cosmopolitanism of inter-republic law and not a vision of global
citizenship as such. In Arendt's words: ['Nobody can be a citizen of the
world as he is a citizen of his country'. **All things political are so
by virtue of their dependence 'on plurality, diversity, and mutual
limitations'**]{.underline} (1968d: 81). **[The 'rights and duties' of
citizenship 'must be defined and limited, not only by those of his
fellow citizens, but also by the boundaries of a
territory']{.underline}** (1968d: 81). **[The organisation of politics,
human-made laws and conventions, is fragile and historically contingent
as well as spatially bound]{.underline}**. **[Everything Arendt had
learned from history taught her not to seek to replace one grand scheme
of global political and military transformation with another. Rather she
preferred to draw attention to the continual examples of violent and
non-violent political foundings, the formation of councils and
small-scale republics and popular bodies not always limited by national
or state frontiers.]{.underline}**

Conclusion

Hannah Arendt's approach to theory was inspired by facts and events and
not intellectual history or the history of ideas. In Arendt's mind,
ideas and theories only mattered if they directly illuminated politics.
Born into a generation of thinkers that, as she put it, had been 'sucked
into politics as though with the force of a vacuum' (1968c: 3), Arendt
was a political writer and resistance intellectual as much as a
political theorist (Isaac 1992). A stateless refugee for a time, she had
first-hand experience of imprisonment for political activity, occupation
and struggles for liberation. She directly influenced a number of the
other writers discussed in this volume including Agamben, Kristeva and
Habermas. Her thought overlaps significantly with Benjamin (Arendt
1970b), Fanon, and Foucault. As indicated earlier, she was an important
early forerunner of post-colonialism represented here by Fanon, Said and
Spivak. Like many of these thinkers, [**Arendt embraced the contingency
and arbitrariness of politics and viewed it as an opportunity for
political renewal and democratic political founding. Perhaps for this
reason we do not find in Arendt's work the despair we often encounter in
the writings of Nietzsche and Adorno**. In fact, she persuasively
demonstrated that political action gained a new dignity after the loss
of traditional sources of authority and morality that has attended the
modern age; 'the abandonment' of the hierarchy of philosophy over
politics 'is the abandonment of all hierarchical
structures']{.underline} (Arendt 1982: 29). For these and other reasons
Hannah Arendt's approach to politics and to thinking remains an
indispensable source for those in search of guidance not in what to
think but how to think about world politics (1968c: 14).

### Action Good 

#### Their critiques are only solvency deficits -- they can always win that contingent movements are flawed, but everything it, and there are nevertheless moments which function as thresholds -- their alternative is a depressive perpetual deferral of action which will always fail to actualize latent political energy

Nothing lasts forever, of that I'm sure

[It's somewhat ironic that theories of the "Event" have come to the fore
in the most fashionable areas of academic political philosophy at just
the moment in history when it has become clear that events in and of
themselves don't change anything. From the G20 protests, to the millions
marching against the Iraq war, to the Arab Spring,]{.underline} to the
short-lived student campaign against fees in the UK -- [the narrative of
evental politics since the late 1990s has been reliably repetitious.
**Euphoric outbursts of dissent are followed by depressive collapse.
Eventalism is the manic flipside of the general depressive tendency in
boring academic Marxism -- in which an ostensible Leninism/ Maoism
(everything will change after the revolution!) obfuscates a de facto
Adornianism (nothing could ever happen, everything is bad, so we might
as well keep on taking the state's pay cheques**).]{.underline} The
whole rehabilitation of the status of Philosophy itself in the past
couple of decades -- [**the reversal of the democratising move to
Theory, and the colonisation of what is now called Theory by third-rate
obscurantist "Philosophy" and curator-speak babble -- is a sideshow,**
of course, but a symptomatic one. The sour comedy of academic
philosophical Leninism and Maoism can now be seen as one of the last
acts in a postmodern shadowplay -- a pantomime in which we are condemned
to the role of interactive audience, tweeting our responses onto the
screen behind the main players, who carry on regardless.]{.underline}

The emergence of Podemos and Syriza, the post-referendum SNP and the
Kurdish women's movement are part of another rhythm of political
transformation. [The unseemly way in which swivel-chair Marxist
philosophers and 'anarchists' have slavered over any perceived mis-step
by Syriza tells us all we need to know about these 'revolutionaries'.
They don't want any sort of positive change to spoil the purity of the
'revolutionary' theory. **The revolutionary event will redeem everything
... when it comes ... but the time is not right, not yet, never
yet.**]{.underline}

**[Whether capital crushes Syriza or not, it has already made major
contributions to what will be a long struggle to overturn neoliberal
hegemony]{.underline}**. A line from Keir's "On Social Strikes and
Directional Demands" has kept coming back to me in all of the noise and
chaos around the Greek situation: "Even at their point of failure Plan B
electoral politics can be useful if they can clarify the anti-democratic
effects of neoliberalism that work against all forms of collective
action."

**[If political change doesn't happen through events alone, there are
nevertheless moments which function as thresholds, opening up a new
terrain of struggle, and allowing different collective emotions to
propagate]{.underline}**. While -- for the sake of our fragile
collective mental health -- we shouldn't get too carried away by the Oxi
vote last week, [we shouldn't underestimate its significance
either]{.underline}. Besides, as Bert Russell argues the
[meaning]{.underline} of Oxi **[is not already guaranteed -- it has to
be established politically]{.underline}**. [The current
struggl]{.underline}e in Europe -- currently focused on Greece, but sure
to spread much wider in the near future -- **[is an opportunity for us
to reclaim democracy after its capture by neoliberalism]{.underline}**
in the 1970s and 1980s.

### Uniqueness -- Institutions Good/Cede Political

#### Politics are at an impasse wherein latent populist energy could be transformed into fascism or progressive socialism -- genuine change is possible and happening now, but a retreat from politics cedes the political

, 7-12-19 dwrs\]

[These are unsettled times for democratic politics. Shocked by the
victory of Eurosceptic coalitions in Austria and in Italy, the
neoliberal elites -- already worried by the Brexit vote and the victory
of Donald Trump -- **now claim democracy is in danger and raise the
alarm against a possible return of "fascism".**]{.underline}

[There is no denying]{.underline} that western Europe is currently
witnessing **[a "populist moment".]{.underline}** This arises from
**[the multiplication of anti-establishment movements]{.underline}**,
[which signal a crisis of neoliberal hegemony.]{.underline} **[This
crisis might indeed open the way for more authoritarian governments, but
it can also provide the opportunity for reclaiming and deepening the
democratic institutions that have been weakened by 30 years of
neoliberalism.]{.underline}**

Our current post-democratic condition is the product of several
phenomena. The first one, which I call "post-politics", is the blurring
of frontiers between right and left. It is the result of the consensus
established between parties of centre-right and centre-left on the idea
that there was no alternative to neoliberal globalisation. Under the
imperative of "modernisation", social democrats have accepted the
diktats of globalised financial capitalism and the limits it imposes on
state intervention and public policies.

**[Politics has become a mere technical issue of managing the
established order, a domain reserved for experts. The sovereignty of the
people, a notion at the heart of the democratic ideal, has been declared
obsolete]{.underline}**. Post-politics only allows for an alternation in
power between the centre-right and the centre-left. The confrontation
between different political projects, crucial for democracy, has been
eliminated.

This post-political evolution has been characterised by the dominance of
the financial sector, with disastrous consequences for the productive
economy. This has been accompanied by privatisation and deregulation
policies that, jointly with the austerity measures imposed after the
2008 crisis, have provoked an exponential increase in inequality.

The working class and the already disadvantaged are particularly
affected, but also a significant part of the middle classes, who have
become poorer and more insecure.

In recent years, [various resistance movements have
emerged]{.underline}. They embody what Karl Polanyi presented in The
Great Transformation as a "countermovement", by which society reacts
against the process of marketisation and pushes for social protection.
[This countermovement,]{.underline} he pointed out, **[could take
progressive or regressive forms]{.underline}**. [**This ambivalence is
also true of today's populist moment. In several European countries
those resistances have been captured by rightwing parties that have
articulated, in a nationalistic and xenophobic vocabulary, the demands
of those abandoned by the centre-left.** Rightwing **populists**
proclaim they will give back to the people the voice that has been
captured by the "elites". They **understand that politics is always
partisan and requires an us/them confrontation. Furthermore, they
recognise the need to mobilise the realm of emotion and sentiment in
order to construct collective political identities. Drawing a line
between the "people" and the "establishment", they openly reject the
post-political consensus.**]{.underline}

[Those are precisely the political moves that most parties of the left
feel unable to make, **owing to their consensual concept of politics and
the rationalistic view that passions have to be excluded. For them, only
rational debate is acceptable. This explains their hostility to
populism, which they associate with demagogy and irrationality. Alas,
the challenge of rightwing populism will not be met by stubbornly
upholding the post-political consensus and despising the
"deplorables".**]{.underline}

It is vital to realise that the moral condemnation and demonisation of
rightwing populism is totally counterproductive -- it merely reinforces
anti-establishment feelings among those who lack a vocabulary to
formulate what are, at core, genuine grievances.

Classifying rightwing populist parties as "extreme right" or "fascist",
presenting them as a kind of moral disease and attributing their appeal
to a lack of education is, of course, very convenient for the
centre-left. It allows them to dismiss any populists' demands and to
avoid acknowledging responsibility for their rise.

The only way to fight rightwing populism is to give a progressive answer
to the demands they are expressing in a xenophobic language. This means
recognising the existence of a democratic nucleus in those demands and
the possibility, **[through a different discourse, of articulating those
demands in a radical democratic direction.]{.underline}**

This is the political strategy that I call "left populism". Its purpose
is the construction of a collective will, a "people" whose adversary is
the "oligarchy", the force that sustains the neoliberal order.

It cannot be formulated through the left/right cleavage, as
traditionally configured. Unlike the struggles characteristic of the era
of Fordist capitalism, when there was a working class that defended its
specific interests, resistances have developed beyond the industrial
sector. Their demands no longer correspond to defined social groups.
Many touch on questions related to quality of life and intersect with
issues such as sexism, racism and other forms of domination. With such
diversity, the traditional left/right frontier can no longer articulate
a collective will.

To bring these diverse struggles together requires establishing a bond
between social movements and a new type of party to create a "people"
fighting for equality and social justice.

[We find such a political strategy in movements such as Podemos in
Spain, La France Insoumise of Jean-Luc Mélenchon, or Bernie Sanders in
the US. This also informs the politics of Jeremy Corbyn, whose endeavour
to transform the Labour party into a great popular movement, working
"for the many, not the few", has already succeeded in making it the
greatest left party in Europe.]{.underline}

**[Those movements seek to come to power through elections, but not in
order to establish a "populist regime". Their goal is to recover and
deepen democratic institutions.]{.underline}** [This strategy will take
different forms: it could be called "democratic socialism",
"eco-socialism", "liberal socialism" or "participatory democracy",
depending on the different national context]{.underline}. But what is
important, whatever the name, is that "democracy" is the signifier
around which these struggles are articulated, and that political liberal
institutions are not discarded.

The process of radicalising democratic institutions will no doubt
[include moments of rupture and a confrontation with the dominant
economic interests]{.underline}. **[It is a radical reformist
strategy]{.underline}** with an anti-capitalist dimension, **[but does
not require relinquishing liberal democratic
institutions.]{.underline}**

I am convinced that in the next few years the central axis of the
political conflict will be between rightwing populism and leftwing
populism, and it is imperative that progressive sectors understand the
importance of involving themselves in that struggle.

The popularity in the June 2017 parliamentary elections of Mélenchon,
François Ruffin and other candidates of La France Insoumise -- including
in Marseille and Amiens, previous strongholds of Marine Le Pen -- shows
that when an egalitarian discourse is available to express their
grievances, many people join the progressive struggle. Conceived around
radical democratic objectives, populism, far from being a perversion of
democracy -- a view that the forces defending the status quo try to
impose by disqualifying as "extremists" all those who oppose the
post-political consensus -- constitutes in today's Europe the best
political strategy for reviving and expanding our democratic ideals.

### Switch-Side Debate---Generic

#### Tailoring arguments to the format of switch-side deliberation promotes [self-reflexive openness]{.underline}---that's the [best way]{.underline} to cause [wide-scale opinion shifts]{.underline} over time. Absent [normative meta-consensus]{.underline} on [procedural terms]{.underline} for debate that guarantee [switch-side deliberative testing]{.underline} within [mutually-understood constraints]{.underline}, we encourage [dogmatism]{.underline} and [group polarization]{.underline}, which [turn the aff]{.underline}

For other theorists, [participation in deliberation itself **pushes
people to be open**]{.underline}. Deliberative democrats do not want
people to make decisions based on partisan interests, threats, coercion,
aggregation of preferences, or pure competition (Thompson, 2008; Young,
2001). Instead, deliberation should be about the public good not just
individual interests. In this respect, openness is a precondition for
moving beyond less desirable modes of political talk typical in other
forms of democracy. As Dryzek and Braithwaite (2000) argue,
"[deliberation induces individuals to **think through their interests**
and **reflect upon their preferences**, becoming amendable to **changing
the latter** in light of **persuasion** from other
participants]{.underline}" (p. 242). In essence, [participating in
deliberation enables the **social learning** that is **fundamental** to
co-constructing **new understanding** through deliberative
discussion]{.underline}. Kanra's (2012) model of binary deliberation
forefronts the importance of a social learning phase. During this time,
[participants are instructed to **put themselves in others' shoes**,
focus]{.underline} not on agreement or disagreement but [on their
**understanding** of each other, and **consider**]{.underline} ethical
and cultural [**differences**. **Beyond deliberative contexts**, social
learning precipitates a **change in understanding** due to social
interaction with others]{.underline} (Reed et al., 2010). [These changes
require **being open** to **other alternatives** or
**perspectives**]{.underline}, and some scholars even argue that [a
"**key ingredient**" in social learning is **creating an awareness** of
others' **different goals** and **perspectives**]{.underline}
(Pahl-Wostl & Hare, 2004).

Just as deliberative theorists place openness at the center of
deliberation, [expressing openness may]{.underline} also [be **part of
participants' tacit understanding** of what it means to do
deliberation]{.underline}. As Goffman (1967) argues, [interlocutors come
with **expectations** of **what ought to occur** within]{.underline} a
particular type of interaction. Sprain and Gastil (2013) found that
jurors expressed [a **procedural norm**]{.underline} for jury
deliberation [that they should have **open-minded consideration** of
**different views**]{.underline}. Given cultural associations between
doing deliberation and openness, [we might expect deliberators to
express openness as part of deliberative talk]{.underline}.

From these theoretical and empirical accounts, [openness means that
someone is able to **take into account other perspectives**, potentially
even **shifting opinions** based on reasons and stories offered by other
participants in deliberation. Openness **does not**]{.underline},
however, **[require agreement]{.underline}**. In deliberation, [people
are expected to **engage ideas** and **experiences**, and be willing to
**see the value in opposing views**, but they are **not** expected to
**agree on all terms** or **express unity**]{.underline} (Thompson,
2008). In fact, Walsh (2007) explains how [when discussing **difficult
issues**, such as race, it is important]{.underline} for participants
[to focus on both **unity** and **difference**. Listening and
understanding both similarities and differences can help people
**recognize** and **understand marginalized discourses**. But
participants may still **hold different views** on **what policies would
be best** for their community. An epistemic condition of openness **does
not require consistency of beliefs** between multiple
agents]{.underline} (Pereboom, 2008).

Open-mindedness is clearly an important norm for normative deliberative
theory. Yet openness may be possible in some situations but not others.
Discussing members of hypothetical groups involved in deliberation,
Dryzek and Braithwaite (2000) note that [when a group with a **strong
value base** finds their **specific goals** opposed by people **without
a shared value base**, then discussion is likely to yield only
**dogmatic assertion of positions**]{.underline}. In her imagined
dialogue between a deliberative democrat and an activist, Young (2001)
suggests that [activists who seek to **win goals for their group**
rather than arrive at **policy conclusions freely acceptable by all
involved** might **not want to be open**]{.underline}. Instead, [their
goal orientation is driven by a belief that **structural inequalities
favor those in power** so claiming to be open to the point of view of
others may]{.underline}, in fact, [not be true. Activists engage in
power politics to **win** rather than **trust openness** in an unjust
system]{.underline}.

In some cases, [opinion change seems to be **correlated to the degree**
in which participants are **willing to relax their opinions** and
**express openness** to other people's perspectives]{.underline}. Barbas
(2004) found that [opinions **shifted aggregately only** when
deliberators with diverse backgrounds and initially weak
views]{.underline} came to a consensus. While Barbas admits that
consensus can be problematic because often people with unpopular or
marginalized views are pressured to conform; he contends that consensus
can be valuable when participants [have gone through a **process of
learning**]{.underline} and enlightenment.

The underlying conclusion is that [deliberation leads to **new**,
**enlightened judgments**. Discussion also **affects policy attitudes**,
but only for those who have **not already made up their
minds**]{.underline} and without the benefit of learning. [**Opinion
strength matters** since citizens engaging in **ordinary discussion**
lack a **procedural reminder** to **relax strongly held
opinions**]{.underline}. (p. 698)

[While opinion change may not occur in **every** deliberative
situation]{.underline}, Barbas (2004) demonstrates that [people **can**
and **do reform their perspectives** as a result of
deliberation]{.underline}. Yet, [these effects are **less likely** if
people have **already made up their minds**]{.underline} or learned
about an issue. [The **stronger individuals' opinions**, the **less
willing** they are to **"relax" their opinion** and **be
open**.]{.underline}

Openness is fundamental to doing deliberation and yet some participants
may struggle to be open due to strongly held opinions or principles that
prevent them from trusting an unjust system. Rather than simply
presuming participants should be open or evaluating (potentially)
sub-conscious attitude shifts, we look to interaction to assess how
participants do openness within small groups.

Grounded practical theory and AIDA The gaps between deliberative theory
and empirical research are widely acknowledged (Chambers, 2003; Mutz,
2008; Thompson, 2008). In response to these gaps, Thompson (2008) argues
that empirical research should address central problems in deliberative
theory to understand the possibilities of its practical realization. Our
examination of the discursive practices of open-mindedness within
deliberative forums follows this advice. Notably, this approach does not
allow scholars to understand the cognitive experience of individual
participants. We are not able to evaluate how open-minded a person
actually is during deliberation or towards a particular comment.
Instead, we investigate the communication practices through which
participants accomplish openness. Our approach to studying openness
reflects an interest in how people actually act in particular settings
and using that understanding to inform normative theory -- we are doing
grounded practical theory (Craig & Tracy, 1995). Craig and Tracy (1995)
warn that too often "theories developed largely through philosophical
speculation may be difficult to operationalize in practice or have
little relevance to the problems and choices that practitioners
typically experience" (p. 250). We argue that this critique aptly fits
the gap between deliberative theory and practice, particularly in terms
of understanding something like open-mindedness, which is central to
deliberative theory but only discussed tangentially as a practice.
Rather than treating open-mindedness as a precondition for participating
in deliberation, we investigate openness in public deliberation on three
levels: the technical level, the problem level, and the philosophical
level. The technical level focuses on the repertory of specific
communication strategies that are available within a practice (Craig &
Tracy, 1995). Here we are asking a descriptive question: how do
participants accomplish openness discursively? Then, we consider the
problem level by focusing at the problem logic or web of problems
experienced by practitioners (Craig & Tracy, 1995). We are interested in
questions such as: what problems lead participants to meta-communicate
about being open in deliberation? When might being open prove difficult
or problematic from the perspective of participants? Finally, on the
philosophical level we investigate the normative ideals and principles
that provide a situated rationale for the resolution of problems (Craig
& Tracy, 1995). Following AIDA, we describe a problem, associated
interactional strategies, and ideals-in-use within existing
communicative practices (Tracy, 2005). Following the assumptions of
AIDA, however, we treat openness as a stance within deliberation rather
than a problem or a practice itself. Thus, we discuss several problems
and how participants use openness to address these problems -- and the
ways in which openness is in tension with other situated principles for
addressing these problems. Our goal is to develop analysis that informs
how people can conduct themselves when engaged in deliberation while
also theorizing about deliberation based on actual practice. Openness as
a stance Within deliberation, openness can be understood as a stance, a
communicative display of an internal state or attitude (Tracy, 2002).
Stances are speaker-based evaluations that can be analyzed by the
lexical and grammatical expression of attitudes, feelings, judgments, or
commitment (Lempert, 2009). Stances simultaneously evaluate objects,
position subjects (self and others), and align with other subjects with
respect to any salience dimension of the sociocultural field (Du Bois,
2007). In our data, openness appears as both an interactional stance
toward the communication situation and other participants within it, and
a propositional stance toward the content expressed by an utterance
(Lempert, 2009). Stances can be analyzed discursively to uncover typical
stance indicators. But the stance-taking subject can also become a
sociohistocial artifact that combines attributes of speaking and a
social type. For example, Lempert's (2009) analysis on "flip-flopping"
demonstrates how lack of conviction is a key attribute of politicians
who pander and abandon long-held views for short-term political gain.
This example is particularly instructive for our discussion because it
demonstrates how a particular version of being open (e.g., changing
one's mind) could be associated with a pejorative term and negative
attributes. Our research focuses on when and how participants indicated
an open stance and how this stance gets used to address practical
problems encountered in deliberative discussions, demonstrating when
openness is both valued and problematic for participants. Methods The
data for this paper come from a series of facilitated small group public
deliberations about how to meet future water needs in a semi-arid desert
community. These deliberations were the last part of a three-part
community education series around the question: How do we meet our
future water needs? Organized by a working group from UniverCity a
public--private partnership between the university, city government, and
private organizations, the community education series aimed to support
more productive community conversation about water in the midst of
polarizing conflict over proposed reservoirs, which were undergoing
environmental impact assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency.1
The goal of these particular deliberations was not a specific decision
or consensus. Instead, the goal was to improve the public conversation
about water by having participants consider the tradeoffs to multiple
approaches to an otherwise polarized topic (Carcasson & Sprain, 2016;
Sprain, Carcasson, & Merolla, 2014). Using a modified National Issues
Forum design, participants were instructed to discuss their
appreciations and concerns for four approaches: population growth, urban
conservation, storage projects, and agricultural transfers. In the
beginning of the deliberation, all individuals were asked to introduce
themselves, talk about their stake in the issue of water use, and share
their reasons for attending the session. Participants addressed each
approach to the problem separately. At the end of each session, most of
the groups were instructed by the facilitator to reflect on the
discussion through a series of guided questions about the solutions they
appreciated the most, where they were now "at" on the issue, points of
commonality, things they had learned, and areas where opinions had
changed. The first author helped design the facilitator guide for the
event and trained the facilitators who were student associates of the
Colorado State University Center for Public Deliberation (see Sprain &
Carcasson, 2013). This event was open to the public. Participants were
not specifically recruited to participate based on any demographic or
organizational affiliation. Some participants likely had deeply held
beliefs about the issue, such as activists against the proposed
reservoir or employees who had worked for water utilities. Other
participants were less likely to be entrenched if they had only lived in
town for a few years or were committed to UniverCity more than the
specific issue at hand. A range of perspectives were represented --
participants introduced themselves as engineers, farmers,
environmentalists, kayakers, fishermen, city natives, professors, and
more. Drawing on electronic keypad data from deliberation participants
during the session, 19 participants attended 4 educational sessions and
the deliberation, 74 attended at least 1 educational session and the
deliberation, and 13 participants only attended the deliberation
session. The age distribution skews older with 20 participants aged 65
and older and 38 folks between ages 45--64; befitting a university town,
undergraduate students were also present with 16 participants under 24
and an additional 14 participants aged 25--44. Our analysis draws on
small group discussion from nine groups (one group was excluded due to
poor audio quality). Our groups comprised 35 men and 28 women; all
groups had at least 2 women participants as part of 7 or 8 total
participants. Each discussion ran about 1 hour and 45 minutes, and the
audio-recorded conversations were transcribed at the utterance level
resulting in approximately 30 single-spaced pages per group. Following
grounded practical theory and AIDA, we analyzed openness at the
technical, problem, and philosophical levels in order to set up
theoretical reconstruction. Discovering what openness looks like in
deliberation is not a simple matter of following existing coding schemes
given that no other scholars have examined openness discursively.
Therefore, we started with open coding, looking for how expressions of
openness occurred in deliberation. We considered moments that achieved
openness (e.g., changing one's mind), reflected norms of openness (e.g.,
meta-discourse about being open), or supported openness (e.g.,
perspective taking). Ultimately, we made the theoretical move of
treating openness as a stance. After identifying openness within these
discussions, we used these moments to reconstruct the interactional
problems associated with openness. Whereas we focus on how openness is
used to manage these problems, we also considered how and when other
participants challenged the use of openness. Results Studying openness
discursively focuses our attention on what discourse practices people do
to display and accomplish openness. This means that openness is not a
general mood but a stance accomplished by a set of discourse practices.
Discursive evidence of openness occurred in every group we looked at,
but it did not occur frequently. It was not predictable, common, nor
expressed by every group member. We focus on describing how openness was
discursively displayed, and the problems and principles associated with
openness for participants. Openness as a stance Openness is more than
displaying interest or involvement in what someone else is saying.
Physiological arousal such as talking faster, leaning forward, gazing
more frequently at the other, giving more smiles, and high frequency of
gestures indicates interest (Tracy, 2002) but not necessarily openness.
Openness signals mutual consideration and/or a withholding of evaluation
on a particular topic. In our data, openness gets accomplished by four
overlapping moves: (1) claiming an unformed opinion, (2) withholding
evaluation of the stance object (topic under discussion, communication
situation, or other participant), (3) soliciting perspectives from
others, and (4) expressing desire to consider other perspectives. Claim
an unformed opinion In the first round of introductions and the
reflection time at the end of the session, several participants
indicated openness by claiming that they had not yet formed a stance
about what should be done to meet future water needs. So I think that
this is really important and I'm really honestly trying to make up my
mind. I'm really torn by the whole thing so I'm hoping tonight will give
me some insight to how I can help the situation and which way I should
really lean to support. (Table 13, p. 14) These statements align with
the theoretical presumption that participants should form opinions
through reason giving rather than start with existing opinions. Withhold
evaluation about the stance object Participants also took an open stance
by doing discursive work to demonstrate that they were not evaluating
another participant. Consider the exchange between Harold and Michelle:
Harold: I'd like to hear a little bit more about Michelle's point of
view there. I'm not sure I quite grasped it. Maybe what I thought I
heard was something like develop the water where it is, but if there
isn't any water in Firestone, don't ship it to Firestone. So that should
just be desert there. Michelle: Essentially. Saving the energy and
everything required, yes. Yeah. Harold: Yeah. I don't necessarily
disagree there, I just wanted to understand. (Table 13, p. 16) Harold
asks for more explanation of Michelle's point of view. He goes on to
provide an account for this request that places blame on him ("I'm not
sure I quite grasped it") before attempting to paraphrase Michelle's
reason. Michelle confirms the general accuracy of this paraphrase
("essentially"), and Harold continues to do discursive work to
demonstrate that his purpose for asking is a desire to "understand"
not"disagree." This turn functions as a late disclaimer, implying that
asking questions is potentially problematic and face threatening so
openness minimizes the face threat. Beyond this example, disclaimers and
paraphrases are discursive strategies that participants use to withhold
evaluation. Like role reversal (Johnson, 1971), we do not assume that
all attempts at paraphrasing are necessarily successful. Paraphrasing
might be used strategically to distort someone's argument; nonetheless,
absent markers of malicious intent or refusal to be corrected when
paraphrasing proves inaccurate, paraphrasing indexes listening to other
perspectives and actively processing their contributions. Solicit
perspectives from others Participants accomplish openness by creating
discursive space for other participants. Sometimes this move is a
general ceding of the conversational floor (e.g., "so I'll stop talking,
let others weigh in") or posing an open-ended question to the group
without bias. east three kids and two adults, then they might not have
that disposable income to spend on all this stuff. So how do we go about
allowing everyone across the different income range to become a part of
this system? (Table 1, p. 7) In both forms, participants are generally
turning to the group to listen to other perspectives. Yet soliciting a
perspective from a particular person could be seen as a face threat if
it is perceived as a potential challenge. Thus, this openness is
sometimes paired with discursive practices that indicate a lack of
evaluation. Could you kinda tell me a little like kinda what you mean by
that? Like I'm just curious about that, curious about that idea of being
unbalanced. (Table 3, p. 3) Here a disclaimer ("I'm just curious about
that") indicates the speaker realizes the potential face threat in the
request and does work to demonstrate curiosity rather than evaluation.
Express desire to consider other perspectives Beyond soliciting
perspectives from other people, participants meta-communicate about the
desire to listen to and consider other perspectives. This happens most
frequently in the personal stake introductions at the beginning of the
discussion and the reflections de-brief. In the process of being
associated one way or another with those different areas, you certainly
encounter different points of view. It's interesting to see that, and
I'm here because I wanted to see people trying to work together on these
things, trying to understand each other's points of view, because I
think we can get a lot farther if we can work together than if we stay
as polarized as sometimes \[inaudible\] some of these issues. (Table 13,
p. 3) This discussion of wanting to be engaged in an activity where
people try "to understand each other's points of view" implies an
openness to understand during this discussion. Unlike the previous
moves, this stance implies that openness is an essential aspect of this
communication situation. Express attitude change A potential way of
accomplishing openness -- expressing attitude change -- did not appear
in our data. Even looking for areas where individuals might shift their
argumentation from one perspective to another, we found no clear
instances of opinion change. During the reflections, most of the groups
were explicitly asked to discuss ways in which their views might have
changed. None of the groups had people say that their attitudes had
changed. Instead, people side stepped the question or responded with
their position on the issue without implication that it had changed. To
understand why participants may not have expressed attitude change, we
can consider the excerpt below. The facilitator asks about whether any
viewpoints have changed: "I'd like everybody to talk about their
particular viewpoint and if it's changed at all through the conversation
or where you stand on the issue is the same?" After a several turns
clarifying the question, Matt jumps in with his response. I'm not sure
how much my opinions have changed coming in. I do think I'm better
informed just hearing your comments about the changes in agriculture
towards livestock as agribusiness. It's always useful to be educated
about those nuances that you don't otherwise derstand. Knowing the
nuances makes for a more informed discussion and maybe a better, how
one's thinking is influenced, how one's individual basic attitude has
changed. I don't know how many people would come into this conversation
and say, "I'm an environmentalist" or, "I'm a non-environmentalist," I
don't know if that changes, but you can see where you do take away
things that you might not have otherwise gained. (Table 1, p. 26) Here
Matt notes that his opinions have not changed. He goes on to distinguish
between learning new perspectives and fundamentally changing identities
(e.g., "environmentalist" and "non-environmentalist"). This turn
suggests how attitudes may be tied to more fundamental identities, which
makes expressing attitude change or even being asked to state a change
face threatening for some participants. Being seen as learning more
about other perspectives is desirable; switching one's opinion about the
issue is suspect. This comment and the general refusal to admit attitude
change -- even by people who displayed openness multiple times --
suggests that being open to understanding other perspectives is distinct
from expressing attitude change. Interactional problems and discursive
principles The next move toward theorizing about openness in
deliberation is to understand how and why participants actually indicate
openness during deliberation. In this section, we combine analysis of
the problem and philosophical levels of grounded practical theory (Craig
& Tracy, 1995) by discussing the interactional problems that prompt
participants to use openness. We discuss four prominent problems:
disagreement, opinion formation, dysfunctional community
problem-solving, and deliberative sense making. Disagreement During the
deliberative discussion (not the introductions or reflections), openness
is most frequently used to do identity work and address the face
concerns of speakers and other participants. The prominent reason that
this facework is needed is that participants must disagree with each
other to do deliberation despite disagreement being a dispreferred move
in interpersonal conversation (Stromer-Galley & Muhlberger, 2009).
Displaying an open stance is one way that participants can minimize the
face threat of disagreement. In the excerpt below, Sara challenges a
previous argument to control growth by keeping people from moving to the
area. Ralph: I think that there are two dominant influences in this
growth pattern that really need to be changed as a matter of policy if
we are really going to make a dent. One is that we have got to find some
way to stop magazines from claiming that we are the best place to live
\[laughs\]. Cut out the publicity, and that's going to have an influence
I suppose across the age spectrum, but probably more to the seniors and
the juniors, so let's think about the juniors. CSU has got to stop
allowing out of state students to come and decide they are going to
spend the rest of their lives here and bring their parents and their
friends and um 5 out of the 11 of the people on the shuttle to the
airport the last time I went had been here for parent's weekend and they
all want to come back and live here. Um, a tough thing to deal with and
that's part of what is behind my feeling that growth, some growth, is
inevitable. How do we manage that. Sara: Well, I kinda hear what you are
saying, but you know for me I like the diversity we get when we get
other people here. (Table 5, pp. 3--4) of the stance object by initially
noting, "well, I kinda hear what you are saying." This softens her move
to disagree, which she marks by following the open stance with "but."
Whether other participants evaluate openness as successfully minimizing
the face threat of disagreement varies from case to case. In this case,
Ralph recognizes Sara's comment as disagreement and expresses his own
challenge. Ralph: That's one of the sacrifices you have to make, you're
not allowed to have that. Sara: I'm not allowed to have that?
\[Laughter\] Ralph: Nope, no, it's part of what is fueling this growth.
Harold: There is a fundamental philosophy in business and government
areas that growth is necessary, that the way we build out business and
we can't stay on one level. Sara: Oh I think that's a false paradigm ...
(Table 5, p. 4) Ralph insists that there is a necessary tradeoff between
sustainable growth and diversity so diversity must be sacrificed. Sara
continues to engage this line of argument, maintaining her disagreement
with both how Ralph and Harold frame the issue and the values that they
endorse. Discursively, participants engage in bold disagreements without
any indication that they are offended. Using openness to minimize the
threat of disagreement further indicates openness and agreement are
separate stances, and openness does not necessarily signal agreement.
Opinion formation In the opening round of introductions, some
participants noted that they were still forming their own opinions about
how to meet future water needs in Northern Colorado. This problem led
participants to meta-communicate about being open in the deliberation.
... I'm really honestly trying to make up my mind. I'm really torn by
the whole thing so I'm hoping tonight will give me some insight to how I
can help the situation and which way I should really lean to support.
(Table 13, p. 2) This participant frames the issue as having multiple
perspectives, and participating in deliberation is one way of developing
"insight" and making "up my mind." When participants do not already have
strong opinions about an issue, participation in deliberation is itself
a way of developing positions on an issue. In another group, Janet who
works professionally on water issues carefully situated her
propositional stance. So in my work I'm very unbiased very um, I don't
take sides. I'm interested in documenting whatever is going on with
water in the state. Here as a private citizen I might have my own
opinions but I'm really here to learn about what's going on and to find
out what other people are thinking so that we can make this a better
place. (Table 4, p. 2) Here, the Janet attempts to distinguish between a
professional identity where being unbiased is valued with being a
citizen where having opinions is acceptable. Negotiating this tension,
Janet focuses on being open to learn about the issue and "what other
people are thinking" as her primary reasons for being here. Notably,
this comment l tension between having an opinion and "documenting,"
"learn\[ing\] about what's going on," and not taking sides. At this
point, Dorothy introduces herself, but starts by addressing the previous
participant. Dorothy states, "I want to say your opinion matters so
don't say I have to be neutral because of your work." Here Dorothy
challenges an open, neutral stance. Dorothy goes on to describe her past
activism on water issues and even concludes, "so I am opinionated."
Dorothy's comments suggest a rhetorical model of citizenship that
privileges expressing one's viewpoint (Kock & Villadsen, 2012). When
participants claim to have not made up their mind about the issue,
openness is accepted as a reasonable stance, and participation in
deliberation is offered as a principle for opinion formation. But many
participants have already formed opinions. Moreover, claiming to be
"neutral" or avoid "taking a side" can be seen as a violation of
democratic norms. Thus the ideal of being open can be challenged by
participants when it seems to imply a lack of willingness to offer an
opinion about an issue. Dysfunctional community discussion Several
participants introduced themselves with an open stance toward the topic
because they believe the current community discussion on water is
broken. Here, deliberation is seen as an opportunity to approach the
conversation about water use in a new way and openness is a part of
doing deliberation. My primary interest is to see if we as a community
can demonstrate the ability to get unstuck. That we have been stuck as a
community on the subject of water for a long time and if we can
demonstrate through this process the ability to find the options that
embrace a variety of values, that would be the desired outcome. I'll
have some opinions about the river but I'm not going to passionate
necessarily about any of them. I'm more open to hearing what the options
are. (Table 4, p. 3) Drew explicitly takes the stance of being open to
hearing that the options are, hoping to "find the options that embrace a
variety of values" through the process of public deliberation.
Deliberation here has community value and being open is part it.
Deliberative sense making The reflections at the end of the deliberation
became a time for participants to make sense of their discussion, which
often included sense making about their discussion so that it was not
simply a waste of time and effort. In these reflections, meta-discourse
about openness was one easy, available discourse practice whereby
participants could frame their discussion as productive. I think we all
understand, at least where the other side is coming from. I don't want
to speak for everybody, but I saw a lot of head nods, even from people
who were probably of opposing opinions. Even though you might not agree
to the whole extent, you're still understanding. Maybe. (Table 13, p.
25) Julia marks her comment with disclaimers ("I don't want to speak for
everybody") and interactional evidence ("a lot of head nods.") It is not
a foregone conclusion that discussion results in shared understanding.
Instead, the group members do work to establish this as a legitimate
outcome. This framing is not challenged, in part, because it does not
imply a consensus decision; learning about other perspectives is
non-controversial. The ease of claiming openness as a way to make sense
of their deliberative experience is in tension with another way that
participants could have solved this problem: saying that they changed
their minds. During the reflections, facilitators asked participants
asked if they had changed their mind. Eli admits that he has made up his
mind, and his viewpoint also has not changed: "I guess I always have to
guard against thinking that I've completely made up my mind, but I have
completely made up my mind." Several turns later another participant
responds: Well- you know, maybe like Eli, I don't think I've changed my
mind, but I don't know I've really enjoyed talking to everyone else and
getting their perspective, and having an understanding of what's goin'
on, one of my goals in life is to try to have a sustainable Colorado in
the United States, and I think we're completely on the wrong path, and
to think we're just gonna keep growing, taking more water, taking more
stuff out-out of agriculture, you know we have limited energy, we have
limited water, we have limited food, food prices are goin through the
roof. (Table 11, p. 34) Again, the participant has not changed his mind,
but he also uses this as an opportunity to affirm openness by "talking
to everyone else and getting his or her perspective." Repeatedly,
participants are not willing to say that they have changed their minds,
but an open stance can construct deliberation as productive and
worthwhile.

Discussion

Within deliberative theory, [openness is a **central tenant** of
deliberation]{.underline}. Following Goffman (1967), our approach to
studying openness discursively acknowledges that [openness may be part
of participants' understanding of **what it means to do
deliberation**]{.underline}. This is supported by how [openness is
connected to doing deliberation as an **alternative** to **dysfunctional
community discussion** and when participants **explicitly express a
desire** to **consider other perspectives**]{.underline}. Nonetheless,
these findings do not simply demonstrate that openness is part of
cultural expectations for doing deliberation (e.g., Sprain & Gastil,
2013). Instead, openness is also used as a stance to manage face threats
inherent within disagreement. Frequent disclaimers suggest that people
realize that disagreeing with fellow community members could make them
appear hostile or difficult, so openness is a way to avoid those less
desirable identities. Thus openness is both part of doing deliberation,
but it also has other uses for participants to manage the interactional
dilemmas inherent in other aspects of doing deliberation.

Instead of presuming that openness is inherently desirable, we argue
that deliberative scholars ought to start with deliberative practice to
understand how participants do openness. Our analysis raises questions
about several fundamental assumptions within deliberative theory. We
question whether it is reasonable to expect participants to refrain from
holding strong opinions before deliberation in community contexts. In
some deliberative designs, such as the citizen's initiative review,
participants may be recruited specifically because they do not yet have
strongly formed opinions. In these cases, it may be possible, as
Knobloch et al. (2013) demonstrate, to install a norm of openness that
includes waiting to make up one's mind until after deliberation. But in
the context of community issue, it seems unlikely that a deliberative
process would be initiated before community members form opinions.
Polletta (2007) argues that forum organizers should cast deliberation as
an opportunity for participants to figure out their opinions instead of
focusing on being open-minded as an absence of opinions, which fits how
some of our participants used openness as a way to negotiate opinion
formation. Nonetheless, openness-asopinion-formation can be in tension
with other models of democracy that prioritize advocacy and making
strong arguments in favor of one's beliefs, such as rhetorical
citizenship (Kock & Villadsen, 2012). For some of our participants,
openness was seen as particularly problematic when it was presented as
neutrality or lack of opinion.

Instead of promoting deliberation as a place to develop opinions, [we
suggest theorizing deliberation as an opportunity to **listen to**,
**consider**, and **learn from other perspectives**]{.underline}.
Participants were eager to make sense of their experience by saying that
they learned about, and now understand, other perspectives. Listening,
consideration, and learning were viewed positively; [openness was a
means of demonstrating consideration **even while participants disagreed
with** and **challenged each other**. This tendency provides a way to
have the group achieve]{.underline} what scholars call
**[meta-consensus]{.underline}** (Dryzek, 2010). [**Unlike** a presuming
that deliberation ought result in **agreement** and a **single
decision**]{.underline}, Dryzek's (2000) notion of a workable agreement
or the extension, "meta-consensus" (Dryzek & Niemeyer, 2006), suggests
that [consensus is **not** about **agreement about
positions**]{.underline} (e.g., what should be done) [as much as it is
about **agreeing about the range of perspectives relevant to a
decision**. Normative meta-consensus]{.underline}, for example,
[involves agreement that other sides have **legitimate values relevant
to an issue** even if participants **ultimately disagree** about which
values should be privileged]{.underline} in this particular case.
[Establishing meta-consensus necessarily requires **dissent** and
**diverse perspectives**, but it also attempts to **identify the range
of relevant values**]{.underline} (normative meta-consensus) [and ways
of knowing and information]{.underline} (epistemological metaconsensus).
In our data, the participants were eager to make sense of their
experience [by invoking **mutual understanding**]{.underline}. This
tendency could be productively expanded to identify meta-consensus about
the values and information relevant to understanding a particular issue.

### Agonism DA -- 1NC

#### The resolution asks a question concerning [institutional change]{.underline} that the affirmative ought to answer with an [instrumental reform]{.underline} - keeping debate within [a limited range]{.underline} fosters [agonistic democracy]{.underline} which their interpretation undermines by [tearing down the foundations of the political]{.underline} prior to [engaging it]{.underline}. They have [no offence]{.underline} because agonistic democracy does not require uncritical embrace of hegemonic attitudes or ideologies, the [foundations legitimacy can be called into question,]{.underline} but [the infrastructure of the resolution cannot be discarded]{.underline} as a starting point

(Ed, Institutionalizing Agonistic Democracy, pg 190-198)

Third, because Knops ignores the situated source of antagonism and the
persistence of hegemony in the construction of meaning he misconceives
the problem of subordination and oppression. [The objective of agonistic
democracy is not to eliminate all relations of domination and
oppression; **this sort of utopian aspiration leads precisely to the
rationalist exclusions**]{.underline} they are at pains to expose.
Rather, [the goal is to craft conditions under which these relations can
be made visible, and thus contested.]{.underline} [The common values
that make agonism possible, and their dominant institutional
interpretations, inevitably and explicitly favor some identities,
interests, or other articulations of subjectivity over
other]{.underline}s. In fact, these values and their dominant
interpretations act to shape subjectivity so that they are seen not as
constructions but simply \"the way things are.\" Because Knops assumes
the project of agonism is to eliminate these hegemonic relations of
domination, he also assumes that Mouffe needs to establish an unbiased
and objective set of criteria by which to identify and ameliorate these
injustices. Hence his claim that her theory ultimately must rely on
rationalist arguments. But agonism does not share this aspiration.
Instead pluralist agonism accepts that the inevitability of injustice is
the price of democratic plurality, and endeavors to identify practices
that render these injustices amenable to contestation. [Agonism hopes to
set interpretation against interpretation, identity against identity,
hegemonic claim against hegemonic claim, so that in the perpetual
conflict between citizens the burden of domination shifts and
moves.]{.underline} Where Knops sees unbiased consensus on rational
principles eliminating domination, Mouffe sees an elaboration of
hegemonic power so thorough as to make the injustices it produces not
merely invisible but unthinkable. When Knops concludes that Mouffe\'s
agonism should be seen as an adjunct to deliberation, one that calls
attention to \"the erroneous projection of one party\'s understandings
onto another, constraining their meanings - it is fraught with the
possibility of hegemony\" (2007, 125), he is mistakenly subsuming
agonism into deliberation by eliding the ontological distinctions
between the two accounts. Deliberative democracy has faith that careful
scrutiny of arguments, rational evaluation of principles, and
deliberation oriented toward understanding will produce an unforced
consensus shorn of power, domination, and manipulation. Its
reconstruction of democratic principles is one that aspires to transcend
the ambiguity of the everyday in order to resolve injustice. It takes
this possibility as a real one, because its ontology is fundamentaily
committed to the universality of human [nature. Agonistic democrats
refuse any such commitments, asserting instead that the premises of
social life are themselves products of humanity, and that the ontology
within which our politics emerges is itself a product of political
assertions]{.underline}. No standard can be found or created that can
extract us from this process of meaning creation, and thus all political
standards should be understood as both historically constraining (we
cannot start anew) and subject to collective reconstruction (we can act
upon our situation by rendering it visible). Nonetheless, Knops\'s
confusion is understandable-how is one to know what this process of
contestation and reinterpretation looks like, absent some institutional
suggestions consistent with the particularity of the history that makes
agonism attractive? Political liberalism, modified as I suggested in the
last chapter, helps clarify this question. Pluralist agonism requires
some shared commitments without which the unavoidably contentious
process of disputing hegemonic interpretations will descend into
antagonism. Precisely because the clashes of politics are not oriented
toward consensus, and precisely because democratic engagement always
involves challenges with the potential to become explicitly violent (as
all challenges are, at some level, hegemonic contestations), some
institutional norms are needed to confine or limit the range of these
battles. Agonism proposes that our situated context may provide
governing norms that permit the procedures of contestation to occur,
without those same norms becoming idealized or acquiring
pseudo¬transcendent status. We begin from \"our\" norms, which contain
within them some commitment to fundamental values (liberty/equality),
but make the contest over the meaning and implementation of these norms
a central aspect of institutional and political debate. Schmittian
violence emerges when contestants cannot perceive a commonality
sufficient to justify limitations of the tactics employed. But the
commonality that permits these shared limits need not hold
extra-political status. Put differently, the concern of critics of
agonism seems to be that the barrier to violence can only be effective
if it is itself uncontaminated by the conflicts it is meant to mediate,
or can be sufficiently abstracted from these conflicts as to play a
semi-transcendental role. If the boundaries of engagement are recognized
as being themselves in play, then they will lack sufficient purchase to
restrain politics. Thus the proposed dichotomy: either agonism will
collapse into warfare, or agonism presupposes a hidden extra-political
claim. Emphasizing the post-foundational elements from which agonism
derives helps illustrate why this dichotomy can be plausibly refused.
This is why the tum to Rawls (and, to a lesser extent, Habermas) is
useful for agonistic democracy. Political liberalism details the way
institutional and cultural structures shape and constrain political
engagement without demanding an external anchor. Political liberalism is
a situated reconstruction of the emergence of the values of liberal
democracy and the operation of those values upon citizens. It is only
the Rawlsian insistence upon a well-ordered society that makes political
liberalism appear as a moralized account of democratic politics rather
than a situated and contingent one. As I show in the previous chapter,
the effectiveness of the situated norms of liberalism does not,
ultimately, depend upon the semi-transcendental status Rawls evokes.
That these values are ours historically, and that they shape our
identities and aspirations contingently, provides sufficient status to
guide political action. [Highlighting]{.underline} this
[contingency]{.underline} [and inviting]{.underline} citizen
[engagement]{.underline} [in conflicts over the
interpretation]{.underline} and application [of]{.underline} these
[values]{.underline} [need not weaken their pragmatic
significance]{.underline}. [It is only dangerous to expose the
contingency of our deeply shared ontopolitical premises if one of those
premises suggests that legitimacy must be derived from criteria not
subject to human agency.]{.underline} It is on this point that agonism
captures better than many theories the central insights of democratic
theory. To the extent democracy is identified with individual and
collective autonomy from imposed authority, to the extent democracy is
identified with individual and collective agency over the terms of
social cooperation, and to the extent democracy is identified with the
rights of individuals and collectives to challenge these authorities and
those terms, an agonistic account of democracy as situated historically
while engaged in ongoing reconstruction of the contingent but deeply
shared values of liberal democracy represents a powerful vision. It
shares with other post-metaphysical theorists, like Habermas and Rawls,
an emphasis on the reconstructive aspects of democratic theory, designed
to adduce from extant practices and necessary assumptions the best
possible description of legitimate democratic politics. But [it pushes
these reconstructive projects further by demanding that the practices
and institutions of democracy itself be engaged in this reconstruction
rather than merely governed by it.]{.underline} Agonistic democracy
emerged reactively, offered as an alternative vision of liberalism,
deliberation, and democratic engagement. The [emphasis of this work on
critique, practices of identity, contestation of power, exposure of
hegemonic interpretations, and so on depict a vision of democracy that
is primarily procedural]{.underline}: democracy reflects practices that
take place within the existing realm of the political.
[Agonism]{.underline} thus [explicitly situates itself within existing
institutional forms, not outside them.]{.underline} Unlike radical
democracy, **[agonistic thinkers propose not a revolution but a
reformation,]{.underline}** [urging that extant democratic resources be
strengthened, democratic values reinterpreted, and **hegemonic
structures exposed and contested.**]{.underline} To the extent agonism
is transformative, it is transformative from within the horizon of
politics from which it emerges. Agonism does not evoke sudden and rapid
change in the character of social order. [Over time agonism might lead,
directly and indirectly, to dramatic reforms to, and even revolutionary
redesign of, democratic institutions, but that change is **inevitably
slow**]{.underline}. [This makes agonism appear conservative when
compared to radical democracy, as radical democracy takes as its goal
the near term transformation and elimination of social and economic
injustice. Agonism aspires to create a democratic social order that will
lead to the amelioration or destruction of injustice, but recognizes
that such injustices are embedded in the context of politics within
which such work occurs and against which organization, mobilization, and
resistance must take place.]{.underline} [Agonism]{.underline} does not
represent transformation, but it **[creates democratic conditions out of
which real transformation might arise.]{.underline}** To claim that
liberalism in its Rawlsian variant represents the best path for agonism
is not a capitulation to the narratives of liberalism and its inevitable
injustices, nor an endorsement of chastened conservatism about social
change. It is to recognize that transformative politics begins within
existing politics, and that an effective strategy must identify the
structures most amenable to that project. Agonism as a political
practice demands both the common ontopolitical framework within which
conflict can take place and an institutional framework open to this
practice. Political liberalism offers both, without also requiring
agonism to shed its skepticism about foundational or teleological
claims. Agonism presupposes active engagement with the situated
character of social life in order to grasp our own circumstances without
demanding to be liberated from them. Political liberalism takes these
circumstances as the frame from which a governing interpretation of
justice emerges; as long as this conception remains open to further
reinterpretation (as it can be once severed from the insistence on
stability) political liberalism supports agonistic politics. The
objections of Mouffe and others can be attributed to Rawls\'s insistence
that the governing interpretation of the political embody an overlapping
consensus with deep roots in comprehensive moral doctrines, and which
can be invoked to resolve contentious questions of democratic life. But
as I demonstrated in the previous chapter, [the political conception
can]{.underline} also be understood as a relatively contingent modus
vivendi, [subject itself to debate when invoked to resolve
conflict.]{.underline} For Rawls an overlapping consensus is necessary
to forestall the sort of deeper public debate and passionate engagement
that agonistic democrats hope to foster. Understanding the political
conception as the negotiated but revisable shared interpretation of
liberal democratic principles permits both the channeling of passionate
conflict into agonistic engagement and the possibility that the
governing interpretation can be itself an object of engagement. In fact,
Mouffe makes the same distinction as Rawls between a political
conception (\"commitment to principles\") and substantive moral
doctrines, as does Connolly when he describes the practices of
contemporary democratic citizenship: They embrace their faith at one
level, and recoil back upon it at another to come to terms with the
obdurate fact that it does not convince millions of others. Sometimes
their own commitment is punctuated with a residual element of
uncertainty. That seems noble to me, but perhaps not necessary to deep
pluralism. What is needed is pursuit of a bicameral orientation to
citizenship and being, in which you embrace your creed as you bring it
into the public realm; and then recoil back without deep resentment on
its contestability to open up negotiating space with others (Schoolman
2008: 316). The agonistic practice so envisioned is strikingly similar
to that proposed by Rawls: citizens hold their own moral doctrines as
true and complete, while recognizing that the entrance of this doctrine
into the public realm will expose your absolute in its partiality. The
bicameralism Connolly describes mirrors the distinction between
comprehensive doctrines and the political conception, with the
difference that Connolly does not think that faith is incompatible with
democratic negotiation. Rawls excludes the metaphysical because it
undermines the overlapping consensus, which must be minimal in order to
be consensual. An agonistic political liberalism maintains this model
without the demand that the passions, ideals, and beliefs of citizens be
confined to the private realm. Since the political conception is
recognizably partial, understood as hegemonic, and an explicit subject
of political engagement, the line between metaphysical and political
need not be policed. What the political conception does, once generated,
is provide a guiding framework within which democratic conflicts can be
engaged openly, where a real possible result of that engagement is a
revision of the negotiated interpretation that is the condition of
agonistic encounters. Mouffe asserts that \"a difficult balance has to
be struck between, on the one hand, democracy understood as a set of
procedures required to cope with plurality, and, on the other, democracy
as the adherence to values which inform a particular mode of
coexistence\" (1993: 131 ). Political liberalism shorn of the imperative
to consensus capture this balance by offering the framework through
which democratic societies can manage plurality by articulating a shared
understanding of liberal values, while also permitting this articulation
to be contested and revised. Agonism thus forestalls the idea that any
democratic institution can claim substantive legitimacy for its use of
power-any act of government is an act of a particular identity or
interest acting upon (not implementing) the collective. There are
collectively binding decisions but no collective decisions; the
institutional conditions of democratic agonism are much like those
described by Dahl\'s vision of polyarchy, where minorities rule and
liberty is preserved by ensuring that no minority comes to dominate in
the name of a fictionalized popular identity. Similarly, Connolly
envisages a society \"made up of intersecting and independent minorities
of numerous types and sorts who occupy the same territorial space and
who negotiate an ethos of engagement between themselves\" (2000: 92).
[This is the structural argument for an agonistic liberalism-**a
competitive environment of plural identities and interests** will tend
to undercut any and all claims to overcome contingency, thus
**cultivating practices that make visible and contest hegemonic
interpretations**. If this can happen within an agonistic cultural
order, within **a shared symbolic framework** (liberty/equality),
exercised by citizens informed by an **ethos of
reciprocity**]{.underline} and presumptive gratitude (which will, of
course, require some material conditions to be maintained), it [is
likely to **maximize inclusion** and **minimize
domination**]{.underline}. Under such circumstances the range of
emancipatory visions and contested democratic norms is likely to be
vast. Since the shared interpretation of common principles that permits
agonistic participation is itself subject to the same regular challenge
and renegotiation, the mechanism for significant democratic change
resides at the heart of agonistic liberalism. And to the extent the
experience of living in a society in which peaceful but passionate
negotiation and renegotiation of the inherited values that bind people
collectively is likely to shape subjectivity, as post-foundational
thinkers and Rawlsian liberals all suggest, [the possibilities for
dramatic transformation to the ontopolitical grounds of that social
order increase as citizens come to see both conflict and reciprocity as
living norms of political life.]{.underline} There is room in this modus
vivendi for radical visions of the future, and room for these visions to
transform the temporary hegemony of the political conception of justice.
While no political order, liberal or otherwise, can ever attain full
transparency, consensus, or inclusion, an institutional commitment to
negotiate and renegotiate terms of agreement that are themselves both
the condition of further conflict and themselves subjects of this same
conflict offers a vision of political life sufficiently capacious to
render transformative change conceivable. I began thisbook with a
discussion ofpost-foundationalism and its implications for politics.
Agonistic democracy, I claimed, offers the account of democratic
politics best suited to post-foundational circumstances in which claims
to have achieved a stable consensus to guide political action, whether
rooted in truth, nature, identity, morality, rationality, or any other
extra-contextual criteria, cannot be sustained. I also argued that the
justification for democracy, agonistic or otherwise, does not derive
from the recognition of post-foundational conditions; like any other
hegemonic ideal democracy is a situated product of the history within
which its dominant position emerged. That is not to say that convergence
on some sort of democratic norms is unlikely, as absent massive coercion
or uncommon homogeneity the radical pluralism post-foundationalism tends
to provoke is also likely to undermine claims to authority based upon
claims of truth. In the case of western societies with liberal
democratic histories, however, the convergence of post-foundational
pluralism and an historical framework that privileges the values of
equality and liberty produces circumstances in which democratic
institutions are the unavoidable default for politics. A commitment to
liberalism also shapes these historical conditions, so attempts to
articulate an appropriate vision of democratic politics that expresses
these situated values and embraces a post-foundational account of
meaning must also grapple with the powerful role liberalism plays in the
interpretation of democratic values in western democracies. These
constraints are neither optional nor binding. [We find ourselves always
already inhabiting a history of meaning, practice, and identity, and
these elements of our being are not infinitely malleable. They may be
transformed, reinterpreted, and eventually even overcome]{.underline},
but such work begins with recognition of our limitations. Marx, despite
his otherwise universalistic commitments, captured these circumstances
as clearly anything in Heidegger\'s work, writing in The Eighteenth
Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte that \"men make their own history, but not
of their own free will; not under circumstances they themselves have
chosen but under the given and inherited circumstances with which they
are directly confronted.\" The inherited circumstances of western
democratic theory include the powerful presence of liberalism, and a
viable theory aspiring to deepen democratic possibilities must grapple
with this fact. This commitment to dealing with the world as we find it
helps explain the recurrent frustration with agonism expressed by more
radical critics. Because pluralist agonists focus on the situated
possibilities inherent to the hegemonic interpretations and norms
already in place and then try to expand these possibilities, they appear
to those committed to the complete transformation of contemporary
liberalism to be defending the status quo. Tally makes this argument in
his review ofMouffe: The most damning critique of On the Political may
be that it winds up reinforcing the status quo \... Indeed, Mouffe\'s
agonistic politics does not seem very radical at all. Whenever Mouffe
addresses practical matters, she uses the language of adversarial or
agonistic politics, but evokes tame and familiar scenes. Mouffe argues
for a pluralism that recognizes real differences, but that also ensures
that everyone plays by the same rules. \"Partisans\" who really want to
change the political landscape may not be allowed to participate (2007:
7-8). Vazquez-Arroyo (2004) develops a similar critique of Connolly.
There are two problems with this critique, and addressing each will help
clarify why an agonistic pluralism is best cultivated within liberal
institutional bounds. First, the critique underestimates the democratic
capacities of liberalism, associating all liberal accounts with a
broader indictment of capitalist rationality. Second, the critique fails
to account for the situated character of politics, asserting a
transformative radicalism that agonism rejects. Often the objection to
[liberalism offered by radical theorists represents an objection to an
idea of liberalism imbricated with existing structures of
inequality]{.underline}, [a rationalistic account of individual
interests]{.underline}, and the problems of global capitalism.
Liberalism thus represents a constellation of problems against which
democratic advocates position themselves. Dietz identifies this view of
liberalism as an abstracted enemy of democracy: \"The polemic that
afflicts so many current studies of democracy and citizenship is most
evident at the level of discourse on liberal ism, where this complex and
multifaceted historical phenomenon has become little more than an
ideational enemy, or a suspect to be processed and called forth for
\'rebuke\'\" (1998: 116). But liberalism is as complex and pluralistic
as any other major account of contemporary politics, and both its
theoretical and historical specificity should not be elided. [Some
aspects of liberal politics contribute to visions of subjectivity that
will generate resentment and oppression]{.underline}, [but elements
within these same theories might also be used to **mitigate such
pressures**]{.underline}. [Some versions of liberalism identify closely
with capitalism and **neo-liberal aspirations**, but others endeavor to
identify **an economic order consistent with liberal values** **without
offering any such privilege to markets or competition.**]{.underline}
Some versions of liberalism presuppose strong forms of rationality while
others are attentive to the variety of ways different identities
organize and prioritize their values and actions. There is no single
liberalism, and-democratic theory would do well to be attentive to the
range of possibilities available within this plurality. Instead,
liberalism \"in much contemporary democratic theory, particularly
post-structural and post¬foundational work, is taken to embody the flaws
of modernity generally and thus becomes the flaw that democratic
theorizing is intended to overcome\" (Dietz 1998: 117). But a theory of
democracy that takes historicity seriously cannot reduce liberalism to
polemic and the dominant mode of democratic institution to that which is
to be overcome. That liberal democracy is in practice and theory flawed
is beyond dispute, but if it also lacks any potential to nurture a more
democratic and less flawed practice then there is little hope for
post-foundational democratic theory. [If only a rupture and overcoming
can achieve democratic outcomes and democracy **will ever be over the
horizon of history**, a democratic theory of **institutions** and
**engagement** rather than]{.underline} **[resistance]{.underline}**
[and **aspiration is impossible**]{.underline}. I hope to have shown by
looking carefully at Rawlsian liberalism as a singular and situated
example of a particular and historically viable form of liberalism that
the more [radical aspirations of democratic theory need not begin and
end with the **rejection** of the dominant interpretation of democracy
**within and against which political action must engage.** Agonistic
theory can offer an account of democracy mindful of both the danger and
the potential of the liberal hegemony.]{.underline} Agonism does not
envision contestation extending \"all the way\" down, as it were. [The
ontopolitical foundations of agonistic democracy are **contingent and
revisable**]{.underline}, **[but they cannot be the constant object of
debate]{.underline}**. [If]{.underline}, as I have tried to argue,
[a]{.underline} [post-foundational politics demands the recognition both
of the contingency of foundations and the situated limits to the range
of possible meanings found in any particular grounds of the
political]{.underline}, **[then an agonistic politics must also be a
bounded politics.]{.underline}** [Agonism works within historicity in
order to expand the constellation of conceivable conflicts, without
**rejecting the tragic reality that limits to inclusion are endemic to
politics**]{.underline}. [Hegemony can be productive or
destructive,]{.underline} democratic or authoritarian, contested or
univocal, [but hegemony cannot be universal.]{.underline}
[Post-foundational politics **embraces the inevitability of boundaries
and limits**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} then [works to make those
boundaries as wide as possible without turning debates into
**ontological conflicts**]{.underline}, conflicts [that cannot but be
violent as they take place outside the grounds of shared ontopolitical
premises]{.underline}. [Calling perspectives that accept the contingent
liberal principles of democratic politics legitimate may seem dangerous,
as it implies that perspectives beyond this consensus are illicit and
excluded.]{.underline} And it does so imply. But the language of
legitimacy is unavoidable for post-foundational politics. \"Contrary to
the dialogic approach, the democratic debate is conceived as a real
confrontation. [Adversaries do fight]{.underline} - even
**[fiercely]{.underline}** - but according to a shared set of rules, and
their positions, despite being ultimately irreconcilable, are accepted
as legitimate perspectives\" (Mouffe 2005a: 52). The condition of
peaceful democratic [agonism is a]{.underline} [willingness to accept
some set of principles, interpretations, or procedures as legitimate,
even if that legitimacy is understood as subject to legitimate conflict
itself.]{.underline} Pluralist agonism endeavors not to utterly
transform the political in order to bring about a new democratic dawn.
Instead, it aspires to deepen, extend, and intensify the democratic
capacity for contestation and questioning already latent within the
situated norms and hegemonic articulations of the political. [At some
point the confrontation between principles is so vast that **the contest
must be antagonistic**]{.underline}, and enemies simply cannot recognize
one another as legitimate. [Political liberalism offers a set of
principles and practices compatible with the type of \"conflictual
consensus\" agonistic democrats advocate, while also highlighting the
historically contingent yet also ontologically powerful status of these
same principles.]{.underline} Post-foundationalism dictates democratic
theorizing both pay close attention to the ontopolitical grounds of any
proposed politics and propose ways to preserve the pluralism that
inevitably follows from the recognition of contingency. [A theory of
agonistic democracy embedded within a modified version of political
liberalism can support institutions capable of addressing both
imperatives]{.underline}, [and the institutions it supports are
not]{.underline} remarkably [different from those envisioned by liberal
theory]{.underline}. The resources necessary for agonistic
transformation are present in the political institutions, political
culture, and political theory of contemporary democracy[. The modified
political liberalism proposed in this book is probably not the only
institutional possibility for agonistic democracy, but its plausibility
demonstrates that institutionalization is neither incompatible with
agonistic principles nor impossible to develop within existing social
norms. By situating liberalism explicitly within **a post-foundational
ontology**,]{.underline} [liberalism is transformed in significant ways
and its practices opened up to **greater contestation**, **generosity**,
and **active re-constitution.**]{.underline}

### Limits Key to Agonism

#### Substantive constraints on the debate are key to actualize effective pluralism and agonistic democracy

Science,Vol. 50, No. 3, July 2006, Pp. 634--649 accessed 7/14/15 CWS\]

A more radical contemporary pluralism is suspicious of liberal and
communitarian devices for reconciling difference. Such a [critical
pluralism is associated with agonists such as Connolly]{.underline}
(1991), Honig (1993), [and Mouffe]{.underline} (2000), [and difference
democrats such as **Young**]{.underline} (2000). As Honig puts it,
"Difference is just another word for what used to be called pluralism"
(1996, 60). Critical [pluralists]{.underline} resemble liberals in that
they [begin from the variety of ways it is possible to experience the
world, but stress that the experiences and perspectives of
marginalized]{.underline} and oppressed [groups are likely to be very
different from dominant groups]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also
[have a strong suspicion ofliberal theory that **looks neutral** but
in]{.underline} practice [supports and serves the powerful.]{.underline}
[Difference democrats are **hostile to consensus**]{.underline}, partly
[because consensus]{.underline} decisionmaking (of the sort popular in
1970s radical groups) [conceals informal oppression]{.underline} under
the guise of concern for all by disallowing dissent (Zablocki 1980). But
the real target is political theory that deploys consensus, especially
deliberative and liberal theory. Young (1996, 125--26) argues that the
appeals to unity and the common good that deliberative theorists under
sway of the consensus ideal stress as the proper forms of political
communication can often be oppressive. For [deliberation]{.underline} so
oriented all [too easily equates the common good with the interests of
the more powerful]{.underline}, thus [sidelining legitimate concerns of
the marginalized. Asking the underprivileged to set aside their
particularistic concerns also means marginalizing their favored forms of
expression, especially the telling of personal stories]{.underline}
(Young 1996, 126).3 Speaking for an agonistic conception of democracy
(to which Young also subscribes; 2000, 49--51), [Mouffe
states:]{.underline} [To]{.underline} negate the ineradicable character
of antagonism and [aim at a universal rational consensus]{.underline}---
that [is the real threat to democracy]{.underline}. Indeed, [this can
lead to violence]{.underline} being unrecognized and hidden [behind
appeals to "**rationality**]{.underline}," as is often the case in
liberal thinking. (1996, 248) Mouffe is a radical pluralist: "By
pluralism I mean the end of a substantive idea of the good life" (1996,
246). [But neither Mouffe nor Young want to **abolish communication** in
the name of pluralism and difference]{.underline}; much of their work
advocates sustained attention to communication. [Mouffe also cautions
against uncritical celebration of difference]{.underline}, for some
differences imply "subordination and should therefore be challenged by a
radical democratic politics" (1996, 247). [Mouffe raises the question of
the **terms in which engagement across difference might
proceed**]{.underline}. Participants should ideally accept that the
positions of others are legitimate, though not as a result of being
persuaded in argument. Instead, [it is a matter of being **open to
conversion** due to adoption of a particular kind of **democratic
attitude** that converts antagonism into agonism, fighting into critical
engagement]{.underline}, [enemies into adversaries who are treated with
respect]{.underline}. Respect here is notjust (liberal) toleration, but
positive validation of the position of others. [For Young, a
communicative democracy would be composed of people showing "equal
respect," under **"procedural rules of fair discussion and
decisionmaking**]{.underline}" (1996, 126). Schlosberg speaks of
"agonistic respect" as "a critical pluralist ethos" (1999, 70). [Mouffe
and Young]{.underline} both want pluralism to be regulated by a
particular kind of attitude, be it respectful, agonistic, or even in
Young's (2000, 16--51) case reasonable.Thus **[neither proposes
unregulated pluralism as an alternative to (deliberative)
consensus]{.underline}**. **[This regulation cannot be just procedural,
for that would imply "anything goes" in terms of the substance of
positions]{.underline}**. Recall thatMouffe rejects differences that
imply subordination. [Agonistic ideals demand judgments about what is
worthy of respect and what is not]{.underline}. Connolly (1991, 211)
worriesabout **[dogmatic assertions]{.underline}** and denials **[of
identity that fuel existential resentments]{.underline}** that [**would
have to be changed to make agonism possible**. Young seeks
"transformation of private]{.underline}, [self-regarding desires into
public appeals to justice]{.underline}" (2000, 51). Thus [for Mouffe,
Connolly, and Young alike, **regulative principles for democratic
communication are not just attitudinal or procedural; they also refer to
the substance of the kinds of claims that are worthy of
respect**]{.underline}. [These authors]{.underline} would not want to
legislate substance and [are suspicious of]{.underline} the content of
any alleged [consensus]{.underline}. [But in retreating from "anything
goes" relativism, **they need principles to regulate the substance of
what rightfully belongs in democratic debate.**]{.underline}

#### Limits are key to deliberation-it doesn't constrain perspectives, but channels difference toward effective argumentation

**Glover, Connecticut political science professor, 2010**

(Robert, Philosophy & Social Criticism, "Games without Frontiers?:
Democratic Engagement, Agonistic Pluralism, and the Question of
Exclusion", 36, project muse accessed 7/14/15 CWS)

[Recent]{.underline} democratic [theory has devoted significant
attention to]{.underline} the question of [how to revitalize
citizen]{.underline} engagement and reshape citizen [involvement within
the process of]{.underline} collective political
[decision-making]{.underline} and self-government. Yet [these theorists
do so with the sober recognition that more]{.underline} robust
[democratic engagement may provide new means for
domination]{.underline}, exploitation- intensification of disagreement,
or even the introduction of fanaticism into our public debates.1 [Thus,
numerous proposals have attempted to define]{.underline} the
**[acceptable boundaries]{.underline}** of our day-to-day democratic
discourse [and]{.underline} establish [regulative ideals whereby we
restrict]{.underline} the **[types of justifications]{.underline}** that
can be employed in democratic argumentation. [This]{.underline} subtle
[form of exclusion delineates which forms of democratic discourse are
deemed]{.underline} to be [legitimate]{.underline}---worthy of
consideration in the larger democratic community, and morally
justifiable as a basis for policy. As an outgrowth of these concerns,
this newfound emphasis on political legitimacy has provoked a flurry of
scholarly analysis and debate.\" [Different theorists promote divergent
conceptions of what ought to count as acceptable]{.underline} and
legitimate forms of democratic engagement, and promote more or less
stringent normative conceptions of the grounds for exclusion and
de-legitimization. [One of the most novel approaches]{.underline} to
this question [is]{.underline} offered by [agonistic
pluralism]{.underline}, a strain of [democratic theory]{.underline}
advanced by political theorists such as William Connolly, Bonnie Honig,
Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and James Tully. Agonistic pluralism, or
simply [agonism, is a theory of democracy rooted in the]{.underline}
ancient Greek [notion of]{.underline} the agon, [a public
struggle]{.underline} or contest [between adversaries. While recognizing
**the necessity of** placing **restrictions** upon democratic discourse,
agonistic pluralists also call upon us to guard against]{.underline} the
[naturalization of]{.underline} such [exclusion]{.underline} and the
[coercive]{.underline} act of [power]{.underline} which it implies.
[Rather]{.underline}, we must [treat these actions as contingent,
subject to further scrutiny]{.underline}, critique, [and
re-articulation]{.underline} in contentious and widely inclusive
democratic spaces. In so doing, [agonistic pluralism offers]{.underline}
us [a novel means of approaching democratic discourse]{.underline},
receptive to the claims of new actors and identities [while]{.underline}
also [recognizing]{.underline} that [there must be some]{.underline},
albeit [minimal, restrictions]{.underline} placed [on the
form]{.underline} that [such]{.underline} democratic [engagement
takes]{.underline}. In short, [the goal]{.underline} of agonists [is
**not to \'eradicate**]{.underline} the use of [**power in social
relations but to acknowledge its ineradicable nature** and]{.underline}
attempt to [modify power in ways that are]{.underline} compatible with
[democratic values\']{.underline}.5 This is democracy absent the \'final
guarantee\* or the \'definitive legitimation.\'4 As one recent
commentator succinctly put it, [agonistic pluralism forces]{.underline}
democratic [actors to \'\...relinquish]{.underline} all claims to
[finality]{.underline}, to happy endings../.5 Yet while agonistic
pluralism offers valuable insights regarding how we might reshape and
revitalize the character of our democratic communities, [it is a much
more diverse intellectual project than]{.underline} is commonly
[acknowledged]{.underline}. There are no doubt continuities among these
thinkers, yet [those engaged]{.underline} in agonistic pluralism
ultimately [operate with divergent fundamental assumptions]{.underline},
see different processes at work in contemporary democratic politics,
[and aspire towards unique political]{.underline}
end-[goals]{.underline}. To the extent that we do not recognize these
different variants, we risk failing to adequately consider proposals
which could positively alter the character of our democratic engagement,
enabling us to reframe contemporary pluralism as a positive avenue for
social change and inclusion rather than a crisis to be contained. This
piece begins by outlining agonistic pluralism\'s place within the larger
theoretical project of revitalizing democratic practice, centered on the
theme of what constitutes \'legitimate\" democratic discourse.
Specifically, I focus on agonism\'s place in relation to
\'participatory\' and \'deliberative\' strains of democratic theory. I
then highlight the under-examined diversity of those theorists commonly
captured under the heading of agonistic pluralism, drawing upon Chantal
Mouffe\*s recent distinction between \'dissociative\' and
\'associative\' agonism. However, I depart from her assertion that
\'associative agonists\' such as Bonnie Honig and William Connolly offer
us no means by which to engage in the \'negative determination of
frontiers\* of our political spaces. Contra Mouffe, **[I defend these
theorists as offer]{.underline}**ing **[the most valuable
formulation]{.underline}** of agonism, due to their articulation of the
civic virtues and democratic (re)education needed [to foster greater
inclusivity and openness, while retaining the recognition
that]{.underline} democratic **[discourse must operate with
limits]{.underline}** and frontiers.

### Institutions Key -- 2NC

#### Focusing on the way institutions constitute and constrain agency is more emancipatory than critique alone. Fields of social and political existence are too sticky to be changed by intellectual gesturing alone.

post-structuralist politics: Mouffe, Gramsci and radical democracy",

[If politics is a hegemonic struggle to articulate political identities,
then values are clearly a key mobilizing resource]{.underline}. Whether
one [understands values as being transhistorical]{.underline}, as the
reflection of underlying social structures, or [as entirely
contingent]{.underline}, **[they are the mechanism through which
individuals are won over politically]{.underline}**. Although Mouffe
eschews foundationalism of any kind, her arguments suggest that she
recognizes that at some level [agents must be motivated to
act]{.underline} at all. For example, at the close of HSS, Laclau and
Mouffe point to the ongoing need for 'utopia', because: \... without
'utopia' \... there is no possibility at all of the constitution of a
radical imaginary -- whether democratic or of any other type. The
presence of this imaginary \... is absolutely essential for the
constitution of all left-wing thought. (HSS: 190) We have seen that
Mouffe has pursued this theme in her account of the role of passions in
democratic politics. Indeed, in presenting her own arguments, Mouffe
consistently invokes the rallying values of the left in the form of
tropes such as liberty, equality and anti-capitalism. However, the
broader assumptions of radical democratic theory cast doubt on its
capacity to mobilize values. Mouffe stresses that a preference for
deconstruction does not entail relativism (e.g. RP: ch. 1). [Despite
this, her post-structuralist insistence on discursive contingency means
that 'values' can only be a provisional and always unsuccessful attempt
to stabilize discourses]{.underline}. [But broad values of the sort
consistently invoked by Mouffe (liberty, equality) are more enduring
than this, both across generations and in the way they are internalized
by individuals over the life-course]{.underline} (Trainor, 2008). [This
is not to essentialize values; how exactly they are interpreted and
mobilized will vary]{.underline} depending on the empirical context
(discussed as 'resonance', below). **[But the a priori assumption that
liberty and equality are empty of substantive content is not a promising
basis from which to build enduring political support]{.underline}**.
From the point of view of the left (itself a problematic term for
post-structuralists), it is precisely the malleable treatment of
concepts such as 'equality' which enabled the rhetorical convolutions of
Third Way centrism about which Mouffe is so scathing. Mouffe's work thus
recognizes the political importance of values, but simultaneously
undercuts their ontological status. A related problem is that although
Mouffe speaks of the need for passions and invokes values, her account
of values is surprisingly functionalist. For Mouffe, values are
politically useful not because of any intrinsic meaning or
representation of something substantive, but because they highlight the
social condition of antagonism per se. Thus, writing of the 'integrative
role that conflict plays in modern democracy', Mouffe suggests that: A
well functioning democracy requires confrontation between democratic
political positions. Without this there is always a danger that
democratic confrontation will be replaced by confrontation between
non-negotiable moral values or essentialist forms of identification.
(2002:10) On this view, the function of values ('democratic political
positions') is primarily to make various subject positions available,
thus providing an outlet for antagonisms and facilitating what we might
see as Mouffe's own meta-value of democratization (RP: ch. 9). The
content of the values at stake seems to be of secondary importance; it
is their democratic function which matters. With this treatment of
values, Mouffe -- contrary to the post-Marxist ethos of expanding the
boundaries of politics -- offers a surprisingly restricted vision;
politics appears in terms of available, rather mainstream, 'subject
positions'. For example, Mouffe tends to cite the familiar schemata of
social democracy and neo-liberalism as democratic subject positions par
excellence. Although she stresses the need for democracy to provide
'political forms of collective identification around clearly
differentiated democratic positions' (OP: 31), she further narrows this
to the need for 'a clear divide between the government and opposition'
(ibid.: 120). This is in contrast to the much broader vision of the
political field in complex, plural societies that Mouffe's
post-structuralist theoretical assumptions imply. Such a narrow,
traditional sense of politics is reinforced by Mouffe's valorization
(via Canetti) of the moment of 'the vote' in parliament (ibid.: 21--5).
There are further difficulties attached to Mouffe's foregrounding of
formal political subject positions. Mouffe is clear that she does not
want pluralism itself to drift into an essentialism 'of the elements'
(RP: 7). The latter, characteristic of much postmodern theory, presents
a political field consisting of an infinite variety of subject
positions, potentially undermining coherent, strategic political action.
However, Mouffe's use of overarching positions such as neo-liberalism
and social democracy risks the essentialism and voluntarism she wishes
to avoid. On the one hand, these traditions are invoked in a reified
fashion, rather than as historically contingent and contested
articulations. But, at the same time, Mouffe implicitly exaggerates the
autonomy of individual citizens to choose between these apparently fully
formed yet also contingent political products. The result is an unlikely
mix of Althusserian ideology analysis with postmodern, identity
politics: the very two things Mouffe has successfully distanced herself
from elsewhere. [The argument here is that Mouffe's project would
benefit from recognizing values as having structural, recursive
properties, and that the recovery of a Gramscian (not a rigid
Althusserian) sense of ideology would assist in achieving
this]{.underline}. **[It is the stable and enduring nature of ideologies
-- rather than rare moments of rupture -- which calls for the most
theoretical attention (]{.underline}**Hunter, 1988; Torfing, 1999).
Gramsci stressed the material character of ideologies, in terms of the
production of everyday common sense at the level of civil society:
indeed, in her earlier work, Mouffe (1979) identified this as his great
achievement. Gramsci contrasted this practical, material understanding
of ideology with the abstract 'philosophies' (e.g. 1971: 201). These are
the formalized, public political discourses which Mouffe has since come
to see as being essential to democracy (e.g. social democracy,
neo-liberalism). Such philosophies are associated with 'traditional'
intellectuals, rather than the 'organic' intellectuals Gramsci
identified as bridging ideas and the lived reality of classes (e.g.
ibid.: 5--14, 418--19). The effect of prioritizing abstract political
positions is, as Richard Johnson argues, to reinforce a mode of
theorizing 'that separated a realm of ''philosophy'' -- here of
democratic political discourses -- from the combined effects of economic
and social pressures on people's lives' (2007: 101). [A Gramscian
approach to ideologies corrects this problem in two key respects. First,
where Mouffe's image of political subjectivity neglects how the agent's
choices over the life-course are framed by material and ideological
influences]{.underline} (Hill, 2008), Gramsci had a sociologically
richer conception of agency. [He argued that man \[sic\] 'cannot be
conceived of except as historically determined man -- i.e. man who has
developed, and who lives, in certain conditions, in a particular social
complex or totality of social relations' (1971: 244). However, while
being alert to the weight of past and present power relations upon
individual subjectivity, Gramsci certainly did not see agents as
imprisoned by them, given that 'the will and initiative of men \[sic\]
themselves cannot be left out of account' (ibid]{.underline}.: 244).
Thus, Gramsci famously described human personality as 'strangely
composite' in its mix of 'Stone Age' received wisdoms as well as
intimations of a better future society (ibid.: 324). Gramsci sought to
understand not just the historical origins of consciousness, but also
the means for changing it, to fight the battle for hearts and minds so
that individuals might be won over to a new conception of themselves and
society. [By contrast, as Brennan Wood argues, 'Discourse theory \...
implies identities so frail that they can be ''won'' only fleetingly.
Such analyses fail to understand meaning as enduring domination; they
fail to grasp what makes ideology worth studying in the first
place']{.underline} (1998: 409). Seen in this light, Mouffe's view of
political action tends towards being -- in the language of political
science -- preference-accommodating: individuals have their primeval
passions, and democratic politics must be sufficiently diverse to
reflect them. This underplays the preference-shaping capacity both of
social experiences prior to political action and, of course, political
action itself. Specifying the content of values -- projecting an image
of the good society (or even utopia) -- is integral to this process of
preference-shaping, or winning hearts and minds. Mouffe seems reluctant
to engage in such advocacy beyond promoting the benefits of radical
democracy itself as a master imaginary. Second, Mouffe's claim that a
spread of available value positions acts as a cooling valve, ensuring
peaceful, agonistic relations, ignores potential incommensurability
between values. Following Gramsci's sense of ideologies being grounded
in concrete practices and interests, it is clear that certain ideas and
practices are not just conceptually in tension or contradictory (e.g.
liberty/equality) but empirically so. Furthermore, such positions may
necessarily seek to obliterate one another as enemies, in precisely the
way Mouffe claims an agonistic, radical democracy would circumvent. To
take the two organized value positions that Mouffe repeatedly draws on,
the logic of neo-liberalism is to obliterate the regulatory constraints
of social democracy which, in its more radical versions, seeks not just
to temper or roll back the market but qualitatively to go beyond (and
therefore 'obliterate') the market form itself. Ironically, the only
political position which claims to be able to finally reconcile these
tensions is the Third Way, which Mouffe criticizes for precisely this
reason (DP; OP). If we recognize that values are grounded in material
practices and interests, it follows that for appeals to values to be
politically successful, they need to achieve resonance with people's
lived experiences of the social world. However, Mouffe's
post-structuralist refusal of society precludes such resonance. An
account of society is necessary for radical democracy to achieve its
stated objectives, and we shall see below that Gramsci again provides
the resources for such a move. We have in part judged Mouffe against her
claim that radical democracy is a left political project. A key
assumption of leftist politics has been that society is a verifiable
entity, and that consequently political action can intervene in and
improve it (McLennan, 2002). Despite this, Mouffe's work oscillates
between extremes with regard to the status of an empirical, social
referent. Thus, she praises the 'marxist tradition as having made an
important contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of the
capitalist system and its consequences over the ensemble of social
relations' (OP: 53--4). However, alongside this background assumption of
a society framed by the effects of capital accumulation, Mouffe
continues to reflect the strong anti-realism of HSS: she implies that
society as such does not exist, or at least not outside of discourse. In
HSS we were left in no doubt about this, with its claim that
'''Society'' is not a valid object of discourse' (111). Even where
society is referred to, it is always instantiated by infinite political
decisionmaking. Mouffe continues in this vein in her most recent work,
summarizing that: Power is constitutive of the social because the social
could not exist without the power relations through which it is given
shape. What is at a given moment considered as the 'natural' order --
jointly with the common sense which accompanies it -- is the result of
sedimented practices; it is never the manifestation of a deeper
objectivity exterior to the practices that bring it into being. (OP: 18)
Given this, Mouffe is scornful of sociology, and in particular the
political-sociological theories of those such as Ulrich Beck and Anthony
Giddens that present 'supposedly neutral \... sociological evidence'
which is the 'typical post-political gesture' (OP: 55). Certainly,
highlighting the role of power and political action in generating social
arrangements enables proper consideration of agency, avoiding the view
of political actors as cultural dupes. However, the ultimate defining of
'society' as simply another imaginary, means that necessary sociological
analysis of the institutions and processes which permeate political
action is shut down. It is precisely this refusal of prior social
structures that limits Mouffe's analysis on its own terms. For Mouffe's
account of the construction of democratic subject positions to work,
there need to be actually existing social structures and relations for
articulatory practices to resonate with. Addressing this deficit again
means restoring to Mouffe's analysis some of the key insights offered by
Gramsci. Kate Nash argues that '[Because post-Marxism cannot develop an
adequate analysis of ''the social'' from within its own terms, it needs
political sociology as a supplement' (2002: 111). In what follows, the
theoretical dimensions of such a supplement are developed by restoring a
Gramscian reading of the social to Mouffe's analysis of political
subjectivities, without returning to Gramsci's class
reductionism]{.underline}. **[This involves, first, understanding social
structures as being prior to agents, as shaping but not determining
action. Second, a notion of society is necessary for political appeals
to resonate with enduring, material social relations and
experiences.]{.underline}** Third, a conception of social structure
enables a theorization of civil society -- so integral to the Gramscian
analysis -- as the concrete space where hegemonic struggles are fought.
**[Armed with an account of institutions -- again underplayed in
poststructuralism -- we can theorize civil society as subject to
pressure from 'above' in the form of the state, and from 'below' in the
form of social and economic relations]{.underline}**. Such a conception
also enables theorization of the effects (but not determinations) of the
economic sphere upon political identities. [Post-Marxism implies an
open-ended political space, with apparently infinite possibilities for
constructing subjectivities. The first step in restoring society to
Mouffe's analysis is to recognize that social structures exist, and are
prior to political]{.underline} action. Against the more voluntarist and
idealist readings of Gramsci, Jonathan Joseph (2008) points to his
insistence on both the existence of an objective social reality and,
vitally, the constraints this imposes upon social and political
possibilities. What Gramsci offers is a reading of the structural
pre-conditions of politics which rejects vulgar reductionism, while
acknowledging that the political is not an entirely contingent and
open-ended field. [This is best captured by Stuart Hall, who suggests
that for Gramsci: \... one must understand the fundamental structure --
the objective relations -- within society \... for these set the most
fundamental limits and conditions for the whole shape of historical
development. From here arise some of the major lines of tendency which
might be favourable to this or that line of development. The error of
reductionism is then to translate these tendencies and constraints
immediately into their absolutely determined political and ideological
effects. \... In fact, they structure and determine only in the sense
that they define the terrain on which historical forces move -- they
define the horizon of possibilities. (1996c: 421--2)]{.underline} This
approach to structure can be applied to the cultural terrain upon which
political subjectivity is formed, and which is critical to Mouffe's
work. Culture consists in the practices, ideas and ways of living which
individuals are born into and which shape processes of identity
formation (Hill, 2008). By contrast, in Mouffe's account, identities are
only constructed through political acts on the part of agents. Mouffe
and other post-Marxists neglect that it is upon the social terrain of
culture that subjectivities are constituted prior to their entering the
hegemonic game in the political field. Post-Marxism thus lacks a thicker
sense of how social and cultural forms of association are a source of
identity. An example of a corrective approach is found in Michael
Burawoy's use of Gramsci in calling for a 'sociological Marxism'.
Burawoy points to the importance of specific forms of collective life
and community prior to the emergence of the English working class. This
class, he suggests, 'could not be regarded as a blank slate, defenceless
against market forces. It was already embodied in community, which gave
it the weapons to defend itself and advance active society in its own
name' (2003: 222). Interestingly, drawing on Wittgenstein's account of
the thicker, cultural underpinnings of language games, Mouffe
acknowledges that 'It is because they are inscribed in shared forms of
life \... that procedures can be accepted and followed' (DP: 68). This
indicates that identity formation cannot be made sense of without
reference to prior traditions and practices. Mouffe herself notes that
Gramsci was 'perhaps the only Marxist to have understood the role of
tradition' (RP: 18). However, unlike Mouffe, Gramsci did not see culture
and tradition as purely or even predominantly discursive entities, but
as complex historical forces with their own materiality and the capacity
to shape (but not determine) current political practices. A more
sociological understanding of identity formation also throws a different
light upon the passions, which Mouffe presents as motivating political
action. Gramsci, too, stresses the affective dimensions of politics, but
argues that 'popular feelings' need to be 'studied in the way in which
they present themselves objectively' (1971: 419). Thus, the passions
themselves are the historically produced, messy and complex outcomes of
concrete traditions and practices, not some primeval political force.
**[Recognizing that the social is prior to politics has important
strategic consequences: political subjectivities need to resonate with
actual social forces and lived experiences. This]{.underline}** theme is
pursued in Hall's Gramscian work on the method of articulation. He
criticizes Laclau and Mouffe's collapsing of the social into an open
discursive field, as this gives rise to the sense that 'there is no
reason why anything is or isn't potentially articulatable with anything'
(1996b: 146). By contrast, Hall observes that '[No ideological
conception can ever become materially effective unless and until it can
be articulated to the field of social and political forces'
(1996a]{.underline}: 42). On this view, as Joseph more recently explains
of Gramsci, '**[Hegemonic projects are most successful when, on the one
hand, they are grounded in deeper social processes, while on the other,
they are further developed through state strategy'.]{.underline}** As
such, Joseph continues, '[Rather than undermining agency \[as Mouffe
claims\], such an approach gives agency a terrain on which to
operate']{.underline} (2008: 128; emphasis added). **[Thus, the
recognition of actual social forces does not diminish the space for
politics but, on the contrary, enhances the possibilities for political
articulation]{.underline}**. [By reducing identity to a matter of
political instantiation, Mouffe bypasses the critical, prior influence
of the social-cultural terrain]{.underline}. We have already seen that
Mouffe presents a rather thin and abstracted conception of political
philosophies (e.g. social democracy); we can now add that these are
offered up for articulation with an equally thin and abstracted subject.
This is no basis for a political project to resonate with people's
experiences. [Of course, prior structures and historical forces do not
just enable the articulation of political values with experiences --
they can also present significant constraints upon what is politically
possible (Nash]{.underline}, 2002). [The post-structuralist account of
the political lacks an adequate account of such constraints upon
progressive political ambitions.]{.underline} This is no bad thing from
the point of view of promoting the 'optimism of the will' famously
called for by Gramsci, but fails to maintain his simultaneous call for a
'pessimism of the intellect'. The latter means confronting the obduracy
of the social relations and institutions of capitalist societies. For
Gramsci, the struggle over identities is played out in civil society. As
Burawoy notes, Gramsci certainly sees civil society as a 'terrain of
struggle' (as do post-Marxists), but it nevertheless 'occupies a
specific institutional space within capitalism between economy and the
state' (2003: 198), and is subject to structural pressure from both.
This is in contrast to the post-Marxist reading in which the social and
the political are collapsed into a single discursive field. Mouffe
suggests pluralist and complex late-modern societies are particularly
conducive to hegemonic politics. **[Given this, it is surely necessary
to theorize the institutional and historical specificity of civil
society as the terrain of hegemonic struggle.]{.underline}** This is
particularly true of liberal democratic capitalist societies, in which a
supposedly autonomous civil society continues to confound the left by
reproducing dominant (neo-liberal) interests and ideologies. [The issue
of structural constraint brings us to the final advantage of a Gramscian
supplement to radical democratic theory, and one which returns us to the
heart of post-Marxism's political ambitions. To self-identify as a left
project, or to be even tangentially connected with Marxism, requires a
political economy that is at least prepared to recognize how economic
relations and imperatives can shape politics. Post-Marxism's refusal of
society means it cannot adequately theorize the increasing
commodification of social and political institutions and
identities.]{.underline} We need not claim any necessary relationship
between the economy and other domains of social life. However, once we
admit the existence of society per se, we can discuss more or less
causal influences upon its character and development. This in turn
allows recognition that economic logics and relations play a key role in
the social and political sphere under capitalist conditions. While
Gramsci had already perceived the importance of treating what we today
call discourse in combination with economic analysis, in post-Marxism,
as Peter Ives notes, 'in order to expunge the ''essentialist remnant''
from Gramsci, economic analysis has to be denied altogether as does the
Marxist critique of capitalism (or any systematic critique of
capitalism)' (2005: 466). Instead, I have argued that we should see
Gramsci as the means to 'bring society back in', providing post-Marxist
radical democracy with the tools to justify itself as a left project,
concerned with understanding and challenging the basic structures of
capitalism. The post-Marxist project -- and in particular Mouffe's
programme of radical democracy focused on here -- has drawn on
post-structuralism to offer invaluable theoretical and political
insights. Originally acknowledging its debt to Gramsci, it has shown how
the left can abandon determinism and develop a hegemonic politics under
social conditions of pluralism and indeterminacy. Specifically, Mouffe
has suggested how the left can reclaim the mantle of democracy, thus
banishing the spectre of authoritarianism. But this article has argued
that the 'postmodernization' of Gramsci has limited the post-Marxist
project in general, and Mouffe's radical democratic theory in
particular. Restoring key elements of the Gramscian heritage could
address these limitations, without jettisoning radical democracy's
contemporary insights. In [contrast to a discourse-centric conception of
the political, with its formally elaborated 'philosophies', a Gramscian
approach can understand values and ideologies in relation to everyday
practices -- including organized, systemically produced
interests]{.underline}. [In particular, such an approach can account for
the structured, recursive character of ideologies. In addition, a
Gramscian approach accepts the existence of society itself, rather than
refusing it or subordinating it to the political. Th]{.underline}is
actually enhances Mouffe's account of political subjectivity, by
allowing for the prior cultural and social terrain upon which identities
are articulated and mobilized, as well as again accounting for recursive
structures of [**domination. In particular, Gramsci allows the
analytical space for civil society as a set of institutions with complex
relations to both state and economy**. In recovering Gramsci in this
fashion, we need not go all the way back down the road with him to
positing, for example, 'fundamental classes' as the axis of hegemony.
What a Gramscian supplement to Mouffe restores are the resources for
thinking about democratic left strategies within an enduring, and
intensifying, capitalist environment.]{.underline}

[Which of]{.underline} these [various international, state]{.underline},
corporate [and civil society responses and proposals should we
support?]{.underline} [What political institutional changes are required
to halt]{.underline} these [repeated scenes of human wreckage produced
by grave injustices]{.underline} such as the Rana Plaza building
collapse? Is progress in breaking the vicious pattern of workplace
catastrophes in the global apparel industry possible? [What can
political theorists contribute to]{.underline} these [ongoing debates
about global justice and responsibility?]{.underline} The main objective
of Lea Ypi's first book, Global Justice and Avant-Garde Political
Agency, is precisely to provide an account of the role of political
theory and political theorists in the struggles of contemporary
political agents for global justice. For Ypi, [the purpose of normative
political theory in its 'activist mode' is to]{.underline} [identify and
assist contemporary 'avant-garde political agents' to]{.underline}
**[realise progressive political change]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
[formulating coherent and plausible normative views about
the]{.underline} **[function and purpose of our social practices and
institutions.]{.underline}** [This is accomplished by employing a
historically informed and forward-looking dialectical method
of]{.underline} [learning from the]{.underline} trials, [failures, and
successes of past political struggles]{.underline} [with a view to
evaluating the **adequacy of different interpretations** of the
function]{.underline} and purposes [of social institutions and
practices]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [distinguishing between more
regressive or status quo]{.underline}, [and more progressive
interpretations of]{.underline} the relevant [normative
principles]{.underline}.20 [The]{.underline} [**criteria for
adjudicating between different** **normative
interpretations**]{.underline} [of the function and purpose of political
institutions involve]{.underline} meeting [three tasks]{.underline}.
[First, an interpretation]{.underline} (or family of interpretations)
[is better than its rivals if it is able to]{.underline} [diagnose the
causes of persistent]{.underline} and profound patterns of [social
conflict]{.underline} [at an appropriate level of analysis]{.underline},
[accounting for the empirical evidence better]{.underline} [than its
competitors]{.underline}. [Second, an interpretation is superior if it
is able]{.underline}, [after identifying inadequacies in
old]{.underline} normative [categories, to]{.underline} [innovate from
them and 'formulate principles that preserve]{.underline} all the
normative [benefits of its predecessors whilst avoiding their
failures'.]{.underline} [Third]{.underline}, [a normative interpretation
can outperform its rivals if it]{.underline} **[displays 'heuristic
potential,']{.underline}** [providing new ways to conceive of
the]{.underline} purposes or [functions of social institutions and
practices]{.underline}, in light of theoretical innovations that
anticipate new, unforeseen questions and challenges. [A dialectical
approach]{.underline} thus [helps to]{.underline} **[make progress under
contemporary conditions possible by providing a way to judge which
theories]{.underline}** (or families of theories) spawned by social and
political conflicts and crises **[are 'better able to combine principles
and agency in a fundamentally appropriate but also politically effective
and motivationally sustainable way'.]{.underline}** In light of the
novel political and moral challenges wrought by new agents and
circumstances of politics, normative political theory should aim to
revise or refine interpretations of the normative principles underlying
our social practices and institutions, in ways that improve their
functionality and responsiveness to the concerns and commitments of the
agents subjected to them.21 The normative theorist who is engaged in
this activist mode works in tandem with the 'avant-garde political
agents' who struggle for progressive political transformations: both are
likened to 'creative scientists or artists who put existing knowledge
and techniques at the service of fresh experiments, developing new
perspectives, asking unprecedented questions, and paving the way for the
development of alternative paradigms'.22 [Drawing on the history of the
women's]{.underline} movement, the [anti-slavery]{.underline} movement,
[workers']{.underline} movements, [anti-colonial]{.underline} movements,
[and human rights movements]{.underline}, Ypi observes that **[the most
effectual avant-garde political agents]{.underline}** [were those
who]{.underline} [tried 'to **subvert specific interpretive patterns
from within, while continuing to act as their critical
voice'.**]{.underline}23 In terms of theories of global justice, [Ypi
finds Kant's]{.underline} own [political theory exemplary for
combining]{.underline} a [cosmopolitan]{.underline} account of
[normative principles with a]{.underline} **[statist conception of
political agency]{.underline}**, and she interprets [Kant's 'moral
politician']{.underline} to be similar to a cosmopolitan avant-garde
political agent who [makes it her 'duty to]{.underline} **[act within
the state in conformity with cosmopolitan principles of
justice']{.underline}**.24 [An adequate]{.underline} [activist political
theory should]{.underline} be able to [give an account of the moral
desirability of principles]{.underline}, **[as well their political
feasibility and motivational sustainability]{.underline}**. [Doing so
requires confronting]{.underline} issues of [principle and]{.underline}
issues of [political agency]{.underline}, and [combining them in ways
that make possible progressive political change]{.underline}. Ypi
observes, however, that [normative political theorists have tended to
ignore the normative relevance of political agency]{.underline} [to the
task of formulating normative principles]{.underline} for politics.
[This]{.underline} ignorance or [disconnect between normative principles
and political agency is apparent in the]{.underline} two [dominant
approaches---ideal and non-ideal---to normative political
theory.]{.underline} **[Ideal theory approaches]{.underline}** are
truth-seeking enterprises that '[try to]{.underline} identify and
[establish a fundamentally appropriate analysis of]{.underline}
first-order [normative principles,]{.underline} **[regardless of whether
these principles can meaningfully guide action in the real
world']{.underline}**.25 [While]{.underline} constructing [principles
based on idealised agents]{.underline}, structures, [and conditions may
have some critical force]{.underline} in that they provide a basis for
evaluating the justness of existing principles, practices, and social
conditions, Ypi argues that [ideal theoretical approaches]{.underline}
tend to **[generate principles that are indeterminate, irrelevant, or
distorting]{.underline}**, [given their disconnection from issues of
political agency]{.underline}.26 Non-ideal approaches, in contrast, 'aim
to develop principles able to guide agency in empirically contingent
circumstances', and typically take the current circumstances
conditioning social and political agency to 'play a constitutive role'
in formulating the relevant normative principles.27 Ypi is concerned,
however, that [non-ideal theoretical approaches are vulnerable to a
status quo bias]{.underline}, compromising the critical task of
normative theory by [taking too much of existing agents, practices,
institutions, and conditions as they are]{.underline}. Ypi admits that
these are stylised reconstructions, and that most contemporary political
theories of global justice exhibit elements of both ideal and non-ideal
theoretical approaches so understood. Indeed, it should be noted that
Ypi's interpretation of the function of ideal and non-ideal theories
reveals a certain dissatisfaction with a standard way of thinking about
their distinction.28 In the seminal account by John Rawls, ideal
theories are the primary task of the political theorist, and have as
their aim the identification of the correct first-order normative
principles to guide the major social and political institutions of a
society. Ideal theory accomplishes this task by abstracting from
historically contingent circumstances, and idealising agents, structures
or conditions in certain counterfactual and favourable ways.29 Non-ideal
theory is distinguished by its aim to identify transitional normative
principles in response to unfavourable contexts where agents are either
wilfully acting against the normative principles identified in ideal
theory, or are involuntarily incapable of acting according to those
principles. For example, in Rawls's Law of Peoples, the duty of
assistance is a principle of non-ideal theory to deal with the
problematic existence of burdened societies that lack the capacity to
develop domestically decent or just political and social institutions.30
Non-ideal principles thus serve a transitional aim of helping agents to
progress towards an ideal account of justice. Ypi's formulation of [the
distinction between ideal and non-ideal approaches to political
theory]{.underline} serves a different purpose than this Rawlsian
account. Her interpretation of the distinction [operates to highlight
the relationship between normative principles and political
agency]{.underline}, [and how problematic relationships between
these]{.underline}--[too distant and too close--can]{.underline}
undermine either the critical value or the efficacy of any normative
theory. [From an activist theoretical perspective]{.underline}, [ideal
theoretical approaches]{.underline} may avoid a status quo bias, but
they typically **[fail to contribute to solving problems confronted by
agents currently suffering]{.underline}** [from inadequate political and
social institutions and arrangements]{.underline}, whereas non-ideal
theoretical approaches tend to generate myopic views of problem solving
that typically lack critical force or emanicipatory potential. With her
account of 'activist political theory' and the 'dialectical approach',
Ypi is able to expose unconstructive aspects of the contemporary global
justice debate among the two main rivals, cosmopolitans and statists.
Ypi is not against cosmopolitanism, but she criticises a tendency of
[cosmopolitan theorists]{.underline} to **[dismiss the normative
relevance of the state and state-based associations]{.underline}** [for
realising cosmopolitan egalitarian conceptions of global
justice.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} dismissal, most salient in
cosmopolitan arguments about the moral arbitrariness and insignificance
of polit ical associations or relational ties, [is]{.underline}
**[unconstructive and detrimental to the cause of advancing cosmopolitan
normative principles]{.underline}** [because it]{.underline} [**fails to
recognise the importance of political agency** for the]{.underline}
[realisation of cosmopolitan aims]{.underline}. According to Ypi, [the
cosmopolitan disavowal of political membership]{.underline} and
associative relations '[is]{.underline} both [unnecessary and
unwarranted]{.underline} ... [Rejecting the normative standing of
political communities hardly supports the defence of global distributive
principles; it merely]{.underline} [draws attention away from some
relevant conceptual tools necessary to analyse global political
transformation']{.underline}. **[Being disconnected from how political
agency takes shape in the world, and failing to provide principled
guidance]{.underline}** [on how agents committed to cosmopolitan
normative principles **should aim to reform particular
institutions**]{.underline} and practices, **[deprives cosmopolitan
theories of their transformative potential and relevance]{.underline}**
[to contemporary political struggles for global justice]{.underline}.31
[A critical]{.underline} and constructive [theory of global justice
should not only provide normative principles that are fundamentally
appropriate, but]{.underline} **[also address issues of political agency
that render such principles politically effective and motivationally
sustainable.]{.underline}**

[The dearth of conventional collective action]{.underline}--- in par tic
u lar, contentious protests among the subaltern groups (the poor,
peasants, and women) in the developing countries, together with a
disillusionment with dominant socialist parties, [pushed
many]{.underline} radical observers [to "discover" and highlight
different types of activism]{.underline}, however small- scale, local,
or even individualistic. Such a quest, meanwhile, both contributed to
and benefi ted from the upsurge of theoretical perspectives, during the
1980s, associated with [poststructuralism]{.underline} that [made
**micropolitics** and **"everyday resistance"**]{.underline} a
[popular]{.underline} idea. James Scott's departure, during the 1980s,
from a structuralist position in studying the behavior of the peasantry
in Asia to a more ethnographic method of focusing on individual
reactions of peasants contributed considerably to this paradigm shift
.27 In the meantime, Foucault's "decentered" notion of power, together
with a revival of neo- Gramscian politics of culture (hegemony), served
as a key theoretical backing for micropolitics, and thus the "re sis
tance" perspective. The notion of "re sis tance" came to stress that
power and counterpower were not in binary opposition, but in a
decoupled, complex, ambivalent, and perpetual "dance of control."28 It
based itself on the Foucauldian idea that "wherever there is power there
is re sis tance," although the latter consisted largely of small- scale,
everyday, tiny activities that the agents could aff ord to articulate
given their po liti cal constraints. Such a perception of re sis tance
penetrated not only peasant studies, but a variety of fi elds, including
labor studies, identity politics, ethnicity, women's studies, education,
and studies of the urban subaltern. Thus, multiple researchers discussed
how relating stories about miracles "gives voice to pop u lar re sis
tance"29; how disenfranchised women resisted patriarchy by relating
folktales and songs or by pretending to be possessed or crazy;30 how
reviving extended family among the urban pop u lar classes represented
an "avenue of po liti cal participation."31 The relationships between
the Filipino bar girls and western men were discussed not simply in
terms of total domination, but in a complex and contingent fashion;32
and the veiling of the Muslim working woman has been represented not in
simple terms of submission, but in ambivalent terms of protest and co-
optation--- hence, an "accommodating protest."33 Indeed, on occasions,
both veiling and unveiling were simultaneously considered as a symbol of
re sis tance. Undoubtedly, such an attempt to grant agency to the
subjects that until then were depicted as "passive poor," "submissive
women," "apo liti cal peasant," and "oppressed worker" was a positive
development. The re sis tance paradigm helps to uncover the complexity
of power relations in society in general, and the politics of the
subaltern in par tic u lar. It tells us that we may not expect a
universalized form of struggle; that totalizing pictures oft en distort
variations in people's perceptions about change; that local should be
recognized as a signifi cant site of struggle as well as a unit of
analysis; that or ga nized collective action may not be possible
everywhere, and thus alternative forms of struggles must be discovered
and acknowledged; that or ganized protest as such may not necessarily be
privileged in the situations where suppression rules. The value of a
more fl exible, small- scale, and unbureaucratic activism should,
therefore, be acknowledged.34 These are some of the issues that
critiques of poststructuralist advocates of "re sis tance" ignore.35 Yet
**[a number]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[conceptual]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[political problems]{.underline}** also [emerge from
this paradigm]{.underline}. The immediate trouble is how to
conceptualize re sis tance, and its relation to power, domination, and
submission. James Scott seems to be clear about what he means by the
term: Class re sis tance includes any act(s) by member(s) of a
subordinate class that is or are intended either to mitigate or deny
claims (for example, rents, taxes, prestige) made on that class by
superordinate classes (for example, landlords, large farmers, the state)
or to advance its own claims (for example, work, land, charity, respect)
vis-à- vis these superordinate classes.36 \[emphasis added\] However,
[the phrase **"any act"**]{.underline} [blocks]{.underline} [delineating
between **qualitatively diverse** forms of activities]{.underline} that
Scott lists. [Are we not to distinguish between large- scale collective
action and individual acts, say, of tax dodging?]{.underline} [Do
reciting poetry in private]{.underline}, however subversive- sounding,
[and engaging in armed struggle have]{.underline} [identical
value?]{.underline} Should we not expect unequal aff ectivity and
implications from such diff erent acts? Scott was aware of this, and so
agreed with those who had made distinctions between diff erent types of
resistance--- for example, "real re sis tance" refers to "or ga nized,
systematic, pre- planned or selfl ess practices with revolutionary
consequences," and "token re sis tance" points to unor ga nized
incidental acts without any revolutionary consequences, and which are
accommodated in the power structure.37 Yet he insisted that the "token
re sis tance" is no less real than the "real re sis tance." Scott's
followers, however, continued to make further distinctions. Nathan
Brown, in studying peasant politics in Egypt, for instance, identifi es
three forms of politics: atomistic (politics of individuals and small
groups with obscure content), communal (a group eff ort to disrupt the
system, by slowing down production and the like), and revolt ( just
short of revolution to negate the system).38 Beyond this, [many
resistance writers]{.underline} tend to **[confuse an awareness about
oppression]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[acts of resistance
against it]{.underline}**. The fact that poor women sing songs about
their plight or ridicule men in their private gatherings indicates their
understanding of gender dynamics. [This does not mean]{.underline},
however, that [they are involved in acts of resistance; neither are the
miracle stories of the poor urbanites who imagine the saints to come and
punish the strong]{.underline}. [Such an understanding of "resistance"
fails to capture the **extremely complex interplay of
conflict**]{.underline} and consent, [and ideas and action]{.underline},
**[operating within systems of power]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the link
between **consciousness and action**]{.underline} [remains a **major**
s]{.underline}ociological **[dilemma]{.underline}**.39 Scott makes it
clear that re sis tance is an intentional act. In Weberian tradition, he
takes the meaning of action as a crucial element. This intentionality,
while signifi cant in itself, obviously leaves out many types of
individual and collective practices whose intended and unintended
consequences do not correspond. In Cairo or Tehran, for example, many
poor families illegally tap into electricity and running water from the
municipality despite their awareness of their behavior's illegality. Yet
they do not steal urban ser vices in order to express their defi ance
vis-à- vis the authorities. Rather, they do it because they feel the
necessity of those ser vices for a decent life, because they fi nd no
other way to acquire them. But these very mundane acts when continued
lead to signifi cant changes in the urban structure, in social policy,
and in the actors' own lives. Hence, the signifi cance of the unintended
consequences of agents' daily activities. In fact, many authors in the
re sis tance paradigm have simply abandoned intent and meaning, focusing
instead eclectically on both intended and unintended practices as
manifestations of "re sis tance." There is still a further question.
Does re sis tance mean defending an already achieved gain (in Scott's
terms, denying claims made by dominant groups over the subordinate ones)
or making fresh demands (to "advance its own claims"), what I like to
call "encroachment"? In much of the re sis tance literature, this
distinction is missing. Although one might imagine moments of overlap,
the two strategies, however, lead to diff erent po liti cal
consequences; this is so in par tic u lar when we view them in relation
to the strategies of dominant power. The issue was so crucial that Lenin
devoted his entire What Is to Be Done? to discussing the implications of
these two strategies, albeit in diff erent terms of "economism/trade
unionism" vs. "social demo cratic/party politics." What ever one may
think about a Leninist/vanguardist paradigm, it was one that
corresponded to a par tic u lar theory of the state and power (a
capitalist state to be seized by a mass movement led by the working-
class party); in addition, it was clear where this strategy wanted to
take the working class (to establish a socialist state). Now, **[what is
the perception of the state in the "resistance" paradigm?]{.underline}**
**[What is the strategic aim]{.underline}** in this perspective?
**[Where does the resistance paradigm want to take its agents/subjects,
beyond "prevent\[ing\] the worst and promis\[ing\] something
better]{.underline}**"?40 Much of the literature of re sis tance is
based upon a notion of power that Foucault has articulated, that power
is everywhere, that it "circulates" and is never "localized here and
there, never in anybody's hands." 41 Such a formulation is surely
instructive in transcending the myth of the powerlessness of the
ordinary and in recognizing their agency. Yet [this "decentered" notion
of power,]{.underline} shared by many poststructuralist "re sis tance"
writers, [underestimates **state power**]{.underline}, notably its class
dimension, [since it fails to see that **although power
circulates**]{.underline}, [it does so **unevenly**]{.underline}--- in
some places it is **[far weightier]{.underline}**, more concentrated,
[and "thicker,"]{.underline} so to speak, than in others. In other
words, **[like it or not, the state does matter]{.underline}**, [and one
needs to take that into account when discussing]{.underline} [the
potential of]{.underline} urban **[subaltern activism.]{.underline}**
Although Foucault insists that re sis tance is real when it occurs
outside of and in de pen dent of the systems of power, [the perception
of power that informs the "re sis tance" literature leaves little room
for an analysis of **the state as a system of power**]{.underline}. [It
is,]{.underline} therefore, [not accidental that a theory of the state
and]{.underline}, therefore, [an analysis of the possibility of co-
optation]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} **[absent]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} almost [all accounts of "resistance."]{.underline}
Consequently, **[the cherished acts]{.underline}** [of
resistance]{.underline} [float around aimlessly in an
**unknown**,]{.underline} **[uncertain]{.underline}**, and **[ambivalent
universe]{.underline}** [of power relations]{.underline}, [with the end
result an unsettled, **tense accommodation with the existing power
arrangement**]{.underline}. **[Lack of a clear concept of
resistance]{.underline}**, moreover, [often leads writers]{.underline}
in this genre **[to overestimate]{.underline}** [and read too much
**into the acts of the agents**.]{.underline} The result is that
**[almost any act of the subjects potentially becomes one of
"resistance."]{.underline}** [Determined to discover the "inevitable"
acts of resistance]{.underline}, [many poststructuralist writers often
come to "replace their subject."]{.underline}42 While they attempt to
challenge the essentialism of such perspectives as "passive poor,"
"submissive Muslim women," and "inactive masses," they tend, however, to
fall into the trap of essentialism in reverse--- by reading too much
into ordinary behaviors, interpreting them as necessarily conscious or
contentious acts of defi ance. This is so because they overlook the
crucial fact that these practices occur mostly within the prevailing
systems of power. For example, some of the lower class's activities in
the Middle East that some authors read as "re sis tance," "intimate
politics" of defi ance, or "avenues of participation" may actually
contribute to the stability and legitimacy of the state.43 The fact that
people are able to help themselves and extend their networks surely
shows their daily activism and struggles. However[, by doing so the
actors may hardly win any space from the state]{.underline} (**[or other
sources of power,]{.underline}** **[like capital and
patriarchy]{.underline}**)--- [they are not necessarily **challenging
domination**]{.underline}. In fact, [governments often encourage self-
help and local initiatives]{.underline} so long as they do not turn
oppositional. They do so in order to shift some of their burdens of
social welfare provision and responsibilities onto the individual
citizens. The proliferation of many NGOs in the global South is a good
indicator of this. In short, much of the re sis tance [literature
confuses]{.underline} what one might consider [coping]{.underline}
[strategies]{.underline} (when the survival of the agents is secured at
the cost of themselves or that of fellow humans) [and]{.underline}
**[effective]{.underline}** participation or **[subversion of
domination]{.underline}**. There is a last question. [If the poor are
always able to resist in many ways]{.underline} (by discourse or
actions, individual or collective, overt or covert) [the systems of
domination,]{.underline} then **[what is the need to assist
them?]{.underline}** If they are already po litically able citizens, why
should we expect the state or any other agency to empower them?
[**Misreading** the **behavior** of the poor may]{.underline}, in fact,
**[frustrate our moral responsibility toward the
vulnerable.]{.underline}** As Michael Brown rightly notes, when you
"elevate the small injuries of childhood to the same moral status as
suff ering of truly oppressed," you are committing "a savage leveling
that diminishes rather than intensifi es our sensitivities to
injustice." 44

### A2: Access More Important than Limits

#### Preserving agonism [solves]{.underline} and [outweighs]{.underline} access - all arguments involve exclusions because that is constitutive of all politics -- the roll for the judge ought to be making sure that these occur along [reciprocal lines]{.underline} while allowing AFF contestation of the limits that the NEG draws -- the AFFs strategy of [pure resistance]{.underline} can only make sense if you idealize [a utopia of debate]{.underline} where all arguments are included all the time, which would be [net worse]{.underline} since it would instill a false belief of neutrality and equality

of power while creating opportunities to transform that power can foster

emphasizes the capacity of the people to control power, the fact of the
pluralism of values, the importance of political equality, the
centrality of liberty, and a commitment to widespread inclusion. Each
dimension is contested within democratic theories, sometimes to the
point of incommensurability. For example, deliberative democrats
generally hope to render power democratic by forcing those who exercise
it to submit to a rationally justified consensus, anti-foundationalists
aspire to fracture the power that shapes and sustains social identity to
open up opportunities to act in ways less constrained by it, liberals
focus on the legitimacy of those who exercise power, and
post-foundationalists emphasize the struggle to establish occupation of
the empty seat of power created by the democratic destruction of unified
sovereignty. In these [different versions of democratic aspirations,
power is seen as a tool to be used in more and less democratic ways, as
implacable barrier to democratic outcomes, as a social process through
which democratic subjectivity can be nurtured or diminished, or as an
expression of social relations in which we are all inevitably
enmeshe]{.underline}d. Similar catalogs could be constructed for other
democratic themes: is pluralism a fact, a goal, a problem, a product? Is
equality a practice, a status, a right, an expectation? Is inclusion
legal, cultural, inevitably partial, ultimately impossible? [Any
democratic theory that proposes the possibility of getting these
questions \"right\" ultimately undermines the democratic ethos by
subordinating the contestability of democratic practice to an
instrumental pursuit of an outcome]{.underline} [for which democracy is
simply the means]{.underline}. If the conceptual contestability of
democracy is merely provisional rather than essential, and the concept
might ultimately be resolved in favor of a final answer, then democracy
is, on such accounts, an expression of other, more fundamental values.
As a mode of political practice, then, democracy should foreground the
ambiguity of the concept and encourage the competition over its
definition. [Post-foundationalism offers an account of politics most
congruent with both the theoretical and practical vision of democracy as
an ongoing contest of internal and external values and
concepts]{.underline}. [The ontological commitment of
post-foundationalism to contingently formed but experientially
fundamental grounds and the inherent contestability of all such
foundational assertions provides a description of politics congruent
with a potentially democratic understanding of the social,]{.underline}
even if democratic outcomes are not mandated or even expected. [A
post-foundational theory of the political recognizes that politics
always takes place within boundaries and under historical, cultural, and
linguistic circumstances that are neither universal nor fully
inclusive.]{.underline} Mouffe asserts that \"every order is the
temporary and precarious articulation of contingent practices. The
frontier between the social and the political is essentially unstable
and requires constant displacements and renegotiations between social
agents\" (2005a: 18). [All politics emerges from a particular
ontopolitical ground, and this ground will authorize certain concepts
and not others, make visible some subject positions and not others,
identify some as us and some as others]{.underline}. **[The aspiration
for universal inclusion or, negatively, for the exposure and destruction
of all modes of exclusion, both evoke a model of the social that ignores
the contestation of foundations at the root of politics]{.underline}**.
[Here we see the distinction between the radical and deconstructive
vision of democracy as a messianic project that can never be actualized
and the post-foundational vision of politics as always involving
boundaries]{.underline}, closure, and necessary injustices. [Little
(2008) exemplifies this distinction in his accusation that agonistic
theorists fail to adequately interrogate the idea of democracy itself,
instead complacently accepting the dictates of contemporary democratic
piety]{.underline}. Drawing on Zizek, Little criticizes agonism\'s
failure to \"recognize that this agonism survives on the basis of the
exclusion of those who do not subscribe to the rules of the democratic
game.\" He [concludes that the agonistic approach is dangerous because
all \"democracies are exclusive and antagonistic to their Others, to
some extent]{.underline}, in order to regulate the behavior of and
conduct between those who are included\" (Little 2007: 176). [The
political ideal animating this position seems to be an aspiration to
avoid all exclusion**, an ideal which is impossible to
attain**]{.underline}. Hence the move toward critique and resistance
that characterizes anti-foundational democratic thought.
[Post-foundationalism shares the concern that exclusion is inextricable
from democracy, as it is from all politics, but rejects the aspiration
to extinguish exclusion. The only way to escape exclusion and antagonism
toward otherness **would be to extinguish politics altogether, an
aspiration that can only lead to even worse results. The danger of
politics is not that some identity or group may be excluded. Exclusion
is constitutive of politics. The danger is that this exclusion is
constructed as permanent and invisible.**]{.underline} The proper
response is not to try and do away with exclusion but to put it in play.
[A potentially democratic politics would be one that highlights the
constructed character of the ontopolitical grounds that generate
exclusion and supports the resources needed to shift those grounds and
thus the relations of oppression]{.underline}. Mouffe takes pains to
distinguish her version of democracy: from the type of extreme pluralism
that emphasizes heterogeneity and incommensurability and according to
which pluralism - understood as the valorization of all differences -
should have no limits. I consider that, despite its claim to be more
democratic, such a perspective prevents us from recognizing how certain
differences are constructed as relations of subordination and should
therefore be challenged by radical democratic politics (2000: 20). [All
politics inhabits contingent social practices. No order can extinguish
exclusion or erode all traces of power. A democratic politics should
highlight the inevitability of exclusion and the persistence of power
while making the contingency of foundations visible to all]{.underline}.
Thus the post-foundational conception of the political lends itself to a
democratic aspiration for politics, though one that will always be
chastened, incomplete, flawed, and contestable.

#### **Treating contingent grounds as either [transcendental]{.underline} or [arbitrary]{.underline} leads to eruptions of violence -- oppression isn't natural or inevitable, it is the result of particular policy outcomes and decisions that can be reversed given institutional analysis**

This contingency does not render the standard capricious: [a kilogram is
a kilogram everywhere, even given the minor indeterminacy of the current
standard, and one cannot simply assert one\'s own definition and expect
to be understood]{.underline}. Recognition of the historically
conditioned emergence of the particular definition of the mass of the
kilogram removes none of its power, importance, or centrality to the way
contemporary humans make sense of reality. The kilogram is necessary,
whether in its current form as a human artifact or a future form as a
numeric standard anchored in natural constants. It is, to use Butler\'s
(1992) term, a \"contingent foundation.\" That the kilogram is arbitrary
does not make it false. Without the kilogram the metric system would be
inexplicable. A standardized kilogram permits us to understand the
natural world and communicate that understanding to one another. The
habits and practices of billions of people testify to its reality. The
foundational character of the kilogram dominates its contingent status,
to the point that its contingency seems irrelevant to anyone not engaged
in the problem of its measurement. [To ask if its value is \"true\" is
to ask a nonsensical question. To argue that the absence of a
transcendent anchor for the kilogram **would produce a chaos of
relativism in global measurement is to assert an absurdity.** Much
debate in contemporary political theory engages arguments analogous to
the attempt to measure the kilogram, absent the awareness of the
necessary contingency of the principles debated.]{.underline} Political
theories in the dominant mode postulate, stipulate, investigate, and
deduce first principles upon which to erect justifications for political
institutions and practices. Or they articulate the telos toward which
human beings tend, toward which societies are directed, and under which
human flourishing might be increased. Political theorists argue about
whether or not these principles or claims are true, where true does not
merely reference wide-spread social agreement but access to normative
reality. Often these arguments recognize explicitly the pragmatic
character of political behavior and institutions while implicitly
introducing a quasi-transcendent standard to buttress the conclusions
reached; variously, these implicit foundations include concepts like
reason, human nature, the popular will, the categorical imperative, the
market, human capacities, religious scripture, neurological discoveries,
and so on. [The post-foundational approach to political theory asserts
that any normative justification for a set of coherent political claims
will have at its core a kilogram]{.underline}. [At some point a theory
of politics must assert the centrality of a claim that cannot be further
defended, a claim that when queried from outside the system in which it
makes sense and to which it provides coherence is exposed as a
contingent assertion of social will.]{.underline} [From the
post-foundational perspective all political systems are **similarly
dependent** upon **contingent foundations**, whether theorized or
not.]{.underline} To understand the development of agonistic democratic
theory it is important to distinguish post-foundationalism from
anti-foundationalism. Both share a range of philosophical assumptions
and draw from overlapping intellectual lineages reaching back at least
to Rorty (1979), who identified \"anti¬foundationalism as a slogan for a
complex cluster of ideas previously lacking resonant expression\"
(Simpson 1987: 1-2, quoted in Seery 1999: 467). These hared presumptions
are described by Fish: Anti-foundationalism teaches that questions of
fact, truth, correctness, validity, and clarity can neither be posed nor
answered in reference to some extracontextual, ahistorical,
nonsituational reality, or rule, or law, or value; rather,
anti-foundationalism asserts, all of these matters are intelligible and
debatable only within the precincts of the contexts or situations or
paradigms or communities that give them their local and changeable shape
(1989, 344). As anti-foundational work in political theory became more
sophisticated[, a divergence emerged between thinkers focused on
exposing the limits of foundationalism as the key step in making
emancipation possible and those emphasizing that recognition of the
inevitability of founding narratives is a condition offurther work to
reform them]{.underline} (For a detailed discussion, see Marchart 2007).
The two dispositions differ significantly in how they understand the
status of contingent foundations and their political implications. With
the caveat that all such classifications are overbroad and reductive for
specific thinkers, I suggest the central distinctions between post- and
anti- foundationalism lie in their disparate analyses of the necessity
of foundations and their different aspirations for human emancipation.
These two distinctions are rooted in a third: their understanding of the
status of \"truth.\" Both positions recognize that the contingent
foundations upon which political systems depend produce and sustain
relations of power. The \"givens\" that ground any social order
delineate the terms of social identity, determine the characteristics
that will be systematically rewarded or define the terms of universality
against which deviance will emerge, provide the range of acceptable
values against which action will be conceptualized, and establish the
appropriate domain of political questions. All of these outcomes, which
shift across cultures and time as social foundations differ, shape the
allocation of resources, privilege, and cultural advantages that
translate into political power. Both post- and anti-foundational
theorists recognize that the distribution of power emerging from a
particular set of foundations also tends to render these foundations
invisible, as the anchor to any system of meaning will, from within,
appear inevitable. Anti-foundationalism describes a constellation of
approaches found in philosophy, literary theory, anthropology,
sociology, legal theory, cultural studies, and political theory.1
[Anti-foundationalist political theories suggest the narratives that
impose and sustain social relations are inherently oppressive because of
the necessary exclusions of difference required to maintain the illusion
of totality and coherence. Foundational narratives are]{.underline}, on
this account, **[always a threat to otherness]{.underline}**, always
**[a danger to particularity and individuality,]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} always **[reflect hegemonic power]{.underline}**. They
further assert that all such narratives must be resisted in order to
open up the possibility of human emancipation. Otherness and difference
can only emerge in the space created by critical resistance to hegemony
and meta-narrative. Bevir describes this tendency quite well:
Anti-foundationalists stress the ineluctability of differences and hence
the failings of any notion of totality or unity. Differences generate
meaning in language; it prevents any meta-theory from covering the
diversity of what we know; and it disrupts the romantic dream of harmony
in nature and society. A Among others, Fish lists the following as
notable practitioners of anti-foundational theorizing: Hilary Putnam,
W.V. Quine, Clifford Geertz, Victor Turner, Hayden White, Thomas Kuhn,
Michael Fried, Sanford Levinson, Barbara Hermstein Smith, Jonathan
Culler, Frank Lentricchia, Jane Tompkins, Stanley Fish, Martin
Heidegger, Hans Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and the
\"entire tradition of the sociology of knowledge\" (1989, 345). While
this list includes thinkers that would be described as post- rather than
anti-foundational in my analysis, it does illuminate the wide and deep
influence of this intellectual disposition. Within the more narrowly
circumscribed realm of political theory with which this argument is
concerned, [the]{.underline} most prominent purveyors of
[anti-foundationalism]{.underline} as I understand it are Rorty,
Lyotard, Baudrillard, and (some interpretations of) Foucault, all of
whom [can be read to encourage]{.underline} [an unceasing resistance to
naturalism]{.underline}, [meta-narrative, and power as the route
to]{.underline} [emancipatory]{.underline} [politics]{.underline}
related concern to defend the otherness of the individual against an
invidious social power dominates post-modem political theories (2007:
48). While the diagnosis of the danger varies amongst different
thinkers, [all assert some version of the claim that emancipation can
only occur in resistance to foundational claims,]{.underline} **[even if
such claims will always reassert themselves in some way]{.underline}**.
Identifying the failings of narratives creates space for freedom and
individual creativity to emerge. By contrast, foundational claims are
always hostile to difference and thus always incompatible with
emancipation. [The anti-foundationalist \"hostility]{.underline} [to all
unities or totalities]{.underline} - what I would call a sort of
positive aesthetic dandyism - [leads them to denounce community as
inimical to difference]{.underline}\" (Bevir 2007: 48). For the
anti-foundationalist, then, the role of political theory is to expose
the artifice of narratives in order to permit the emergence of
resistance and creativity. All foundations are problematic, because all
foundations produce relations of power and meaning that undermine the
emancipatory potential of human creativity, while imultaneously
producing excluded and oppressed subjectivities. This description would
be true even for radically democratic foundations. Little (2008: 176),
drawing upon Zizek and others, argues that the \"issue, then, is partly
about the extent to which democracy is inclusive or exclusive but, more
fundamentally, it is also about the way in which all democracies are
exclusive and antagonistic to their Others, to some extent, in order to
regulate the behaviour of and conduct between those who are included.\"
[For an anti-foundationalist emancipation demands neither the
improvement of narratives nor the creation of more inclusive, still
imperfect, foundations, as all foundations are oppressive.]{.underline}
The post-foundational position shares the diagnosis of the exclusive and
oppressive character of foundational narratives but rejects the
conclusion that emancipation primarily demands resistance. This
rejection arises not from an embrace of totality or dismissal of the
emancipatory ideal but the recognition that ocial **[foundations are
unavoidable]{.underline}**. [While it is accurate to assert that
meaning, identity, power, and other core aspects of political life
emerge contingently within the play of language and the developments of
history**, it is not accurate to assert that these foundations can be
escaped or weakened so dramatically as to lose their hold on
subjects**.]{.underline} [As social creatures without access to
transcendent truths or unmediated ontological knowledge, meaning will
always depend upon some constellation of assumptions shared by the
community within which politics takes]{.underline} [place]{.underline}.
In practice, **[human beings rely upon foundations, regardless of their
ultimate status]{.underline}**. [It is simply not possible to escape
them completely, or even to relativize them so utterly **that their
impact is of minor consequence**]{.underline}. **[We require some sort
of ontology]{.underline}**, even if only shallowly held, **[to render
social order possible.]{.underline}** White\'s (2000) concept of weak
ontology provides a useful framework to understand post-foundational
claims[. We experience our own histories as both contingent and
fundamental. We find ourselves inhabiting a set of \"ontological -
gures\" that emerge from our situatedness in a particular history,
culture, and language. We can recognize that these figures shape our
subjectivity in ways that are both not optional to our identity and not
fully accessible to choice or reason, while also understanding that
these fundamental elements of our personal and communal identities are
not \"true\" in any sense that exceeds our own practices and
history.]{.underline} White\'s summary of weak ontology expresses the
commitment of post-foundationalism (though he uses the term
non-foundationalism) succinctly: \"first, it holds that one\'s most
basic commitments regarding self, other, and the beyond human are taken
to be both fundamental and contestable; and, second, it holds that this
contestability extends as well to one\'s assessments of the strong
ontologies of others\" (2009: 815). [The necessary condition of social
life is some sort of shared horizon of meaning, some sort of ground upon
which politics takes place. It is important to post-foundational
politics that the contingent status of this ground be made
visibl]{.underline}e. It is important that pretension to universality be
exposed. But **[it is not desirable to liberate subjects from the
foundational narratives within which they unavoidably
live.]{.underline}** Moreover, the post-foundationalist assertion of the
necessity of contingently held ground allows it to evaluate the
normative status of various foundational claims. For
anti-foundationalism all foundations are obstacles to emancipatory
politics, and all should be resisted. Post-foundationalism, by contrast,
can offer judgments about the relative virtues and dangers of various
ontologies and work to move any particular ontology closer to a more
contingent understanding. Marchart articulates this difference when he
asserts: what came to be called post-foundationalism should not be
confused with anti¬foundationalism. What distinguishes the former from
the latter is that it does not assume the absence of any ground; what it
assumes is the absence of an ultimate ground, since it is only on the
basis of such absence that grounds, in the plural, are possible. The
problem is therefore posed not in terms of no foundations (the logic of
all-or-nothing), but in terms of contingent foundations. Hence
post-foundational ism does not stop after having assumed the absence of
final ground and so it does not tum into anti-foundationalist nihilism,
existentialism or pluralism, all of which would assume the absence of
any ground and would result in complete meaninglessness, absolute
freedom or total autonomy. Nor does it tum into a sort of post-modem
pluralism for which all meta-narratives have equally melted into air,
for what is still accepted by post-foundationalism in the necessity for
some ground (2007: 14). Marchart\'s passage articulates the distinction
between the aspiration to escape or destroy foundations, which he
rightfully asserts would lead to incoherent politics and individualist
anomie, and the aspiration to actively embrace the contingent necessity
of already existing foundations in order to foster in those grounds a
greater opportunity for democratic politics. [Some foundations are
better, some are worse, and all are necessary; the task of
post-foundational political thought is to highlight the weakness of our
social grounds]{.underline}, the costs they impose on otherness, **[and
the resources available within them to develop an emancipatory
politics.]{.underline}** Why, if they generally agree about the
deleterious impact of universalized or insufficiently decentered
foundations, do the two approaches differ so dramatically in their
prescriptions for political action? I assert that anti-foundationalism
presumes a liberatory narrative ofresistance to certainty and rule. An
implicit assumption of an anti-foundational politics is that once the
non-universal status of foundations becomes apparent and foundations are
deprived of universal pretensions, subjects will be able to free
themselves of violence, oppression, inequality, etc. The most common
version of this supposition is found in post-modernist visions of
politics ( often derived from the work of Lyotard or Baudrillard), in
which the erosion of foundations permits the free play of difference and
recognition of the local and particular status of all political claims.
Absent competition for central status in the system of signs, there is
no need for conflict and violence. Such a politics involves practices of
repetition, creative re-appropriation, linguistic inventiveness, and
constant negotiations of difference without the need to resort to
violence. Ermarth describes the outcome thusly: \"The shift of emphasis
engages us in the play of systems in which all definition is
differential and internal to a system, and thus no basis for truth
claims beyond local negotiations and outcomes. That shift of emphasis
forecloses on the endless wars over possession of Truth that modern
rationalism sponsors\" (2007: 15). Sometimes this optimism is linked
explicitly to a progressive account of history in which the overcoming
of metaphysics leads to a higher stage of truth. White (2009) identifies
this tendency in the work of Vattimo (2004), rejecting his confidence
that because foundations are violent in their essence, overcoming of
foundations will lead to a \"higher stage of truth\" and the dissolution
of violence. Marchart (2007: 159) aptly names this tendency
\"emancipatory apriorism.\" [Theorists who posit emancipatory apriorism
presume that once politics is adequately theorized emancipatory and/or
egalitarian results will follow.]{.underline} Ranciere\'s account of
democratic politics as \"a rupture in the logic of arche\" (2001: 14)
perhaps best illustrates this ethos of anti-foundationalism: an
emancipatory politics only emerges in the contestation of the grounding
principles that shape the dominant order. Politics does not occur within
foundational orders but instead \"exists as a deviation from this normal
order of things\" (2001: 18). Politics thus names a resistance to or
disturbance of the \"symbolic constitution of the social,\" understood
in Ranciere\'s thought as \"the police\" (2001: 20); any foundation that
establishes itself as uncontested ( even if recognizably contingent)
imperils the possibility of democratic politics. In the case of
anti-foundational emancipatory apriorism, the most common claim is that
once difference is liberated from the artificial tyranny of
universality, only democratic politics can follow, as only democratic
politics can accommodate the absence of common ground envisioned.
Alternatively, some accounts imply a \"natural\" tendency toward
emancipatory politics, a tendency that is currently obscured by the
totalizing and exclusivist narratives that dominate politics. **[Neither
position is compelling]{.underline}**. **[Why must an emancipatory or
democratic politics follow from the destruction of foundations? Neither
theory nor empirical observation dictates such an
outcome]{.underline}**. [To assert a tendency toward freedom in the
absence of totalizing narratives is **to assert another universal
narrative;**]{.underline} to claim that [particular political structures
will emerge in response to an ontological revelation requires one to
ignore the gap between politics and the political,]{.underline} ontic
and ontological, practice and theoretical understanding. Regardless of
its source, emancipatory apriorism is incompatible with any political
theory that takes seriously the insights of post-structuralism,
post-modernism, or post¬foundationalism. Which is not to say an
emancipatory outcome cannot follow from the destabilization of
foundations, but rather that such results are merely one possibility
among many. Which is also to say that emancipatory outcomes require
further work on foundations. A post-foundational approach to politics
avoids emancipatory apriorism. [Recognizing the persistence of
foundations reveals that any progress toward any type of emancipatory
ideal will require the generation of grounds to support practices
consistent with the goal]{.underline}. The practices of politics are
shaped by and occur within the context of meaning provided by the
political. [This distinction, broadly accepted in contemporary political
thought, identifies the difference between the everyday practices of
politics, generally directed instrumentally toward practical ends, and
the theoretical, cultural, and apparently self-evident conceptions of
the world within which daily politics takes place. The political
describes the grounds upon which politics takes place, and it demarcates
the possibilities and limits of everyday practice.]{.underline} The
political, for the most part, constitutes politics. Shifts in the
political shift the parameters of thinkable politics and define the
bounds of what can be recognized as specifically political
interventions. It is not implausible to describe politics as the ontic
expression of a political ontology. This conceptualization of politics
leads contemporary thinkers to focus on the constitutive elements of
political life over the practical: changing the political leads to
enduring changes in politics, while shifts in politics are likely to
either reinscribe the basis of the political or revert to the mean of
the foundational order. The political should be understood as a
foundation for politics, though a foundation always susceptible to
transformation. Foundational theorists hope to get the political
\"right,\" by bringing culture, institutions, mores, and values into
alignment with the truth of reason or human nature or whichever other
absolute they champion. Anti-foundationalist thinkers wish to liberate
subjects from the imposition of the political, which is viewed as a font
of power to be resisted. In fact, for some post-modernists the emphasis
on play, negotiation, and re-appropriation seems to emphasize a politics
liberated as much as possible from the political. Ermarth asserts the
[post-modem political rests entirely on the specific practices enacted
by all persons who, combining their languages half aware, using
inadvertent repetitions, half-baked memories, conscious choice and
trained instinct, all make more creative or less creative use of the
various languages and grammars available to them, always positioned and
conditioned by the particular grammar but always specifying them in ways
potentially new]{.underline} (2007: 14). On this account the danger of
politics would be that [subjects accept the pretension to universality
or consensus that the political potentially privileges. Since the
post-modem political emphasizes the unfettered play of grammars and
discourses, the proper object of political theory is the displacement or
destruction of the political as foundation in order to make space for
the political as merely politics]{.underline}. Post-foundationalism
accepts neither alternative, instead recognizing the essential necessity
of foundational claims while working to highlight the contingency of
these grounds. Marchart explains this position well: What occurs within
the moment of the political, and what can be excavated out of the work
of many post-foundational political theorists as an \"underlying
logic,\" is the following double-folded movement. On the one hand, the
political, as the instituting moment of society, functions as a
supplementary ground to the groundless stature of society, yet on the
other hand this supplementary ground withdraws in the very \"moment\" in
which it institutes the social. As a result, society will always be in
search for an ultimate ground, while the maximum that can be achieved
will be a fleeting and contingent grounding by way of politics - a
plurality of partial grounds (2007: 8). Marchart describes the
constitutive gap between grounds and action that permits the institution
of political society while also always undermining the stability of the
social. The antic experience of politics takes place against a
background experienced as stable and real; politics cannot take place
without the social and society cannot persist without a foundation of
meaning. At the same time this foundation, the political, is itself
unstable and contingent. Thus post-foundational theorists recognize both
the necessity of foundations and the inadequacy of those foundations as
a justificatory (rather than authorizing) ground for political actions.
**[Politics becomes dangerous when it insists on treating contingent
grounds as either transcendental or arbitrary.]{.underline}** [The
former turns the inevitable but essentially malleable exclusions of a
particular foundation into naturalized oppressions that may be
**unrecognized** and **uncontested**.]{.underline} [The latter offers
the false hope that once arbitrary traditions are overturned an
emancipated agent will emerge within the freedom of unmoored and
fragmentary narratives.]{.underline} [The post-foundational position
embraces the necessity of foundations while committing to continuous
interrogation and contestation of these contingently-formed
grounds.]{.underline} For the post-foundationalist, then, the route to
an emancipatory politics requires an engagement with existing
foundations in order to highlight their contestability. Ideally, a
grounding narrative that incorporates into its assumptions the
contingency of its status would produce a politics attuned to the
incompleteness and possibilities inherent in any social order. Like the
gap between ideal and real, principle and practice, the gap between the
political and politics means that foundations always fail to fully
ground the social upon which they depend. [If this failure can be made
visible without demanding an escape from incompleteness, it becomes
possible to envision a politics that both accepts and interrogates its
authorizing narratives, a politics that creates the conditions for human
beings to begin to exert intentional influence upon the ground of the
social without lapsing into totalitarian or atomistic
practices.]{.underline} White\'s notion of weak ontology provides one
model of this sort of politics, in which subjects recognize their
situated and constitutive relationship to a particular ontology while
also accepting that their ontological commitments are not themselves
attached to any transcendent or natural anchor. Such subjects accept
that their ontological commitments are not optional, while also
accepting that the contingent status of their commitments renders them
particular, local, and non-universalizable. Butler offers a similar
analysis in her account of the manner in which all theory posits
foundations \"constituted through exclusions which, taken into account,
expose the foundational premise as a contingent and contestable
presumption\" (1992: 7). Any attempt to elucidate coherently the
operations of politics will begin to expose the inadequacy of all
attempts to provide a full and final grounding for social life. It is
thus the task of theory \"to interrogate what the theoretical move that
establishes foundations authorizes, and what precisely it excludes or
forecloses\" (Butler 1992: 7). [The task of post-foundational political
theory is not to destroy foundations but to make their contingency
visible so that politics can incorporate into its regular practice the
ongoing interrogation, contestation, and re-formation of the necessary
but always necessarily incomplete and inadequate grounds of social and
political life.]{.underline}

### A2: Agonism Link Turns

#### Wrong-institutional strategies are key

**Kalyvas, Columbia polticial science professor, 2009**

(Andreas, Law and Agonistic Politics, pg 31-6)

Undoubtedly, the emphasis on disagreement, contestation and strife
remains constant in contemporary agonistic theories and testifies to a
conceptual continuity. [Agonism, ancient and \'postmodern\" alike,
consists of confrontational strategies and adversarial acts.
**Both**]{.underline} Ancients and 'postmoderns\' view political
conflict as central to democracy. They **[understand politics as the
enactment of public disagreement and dissent]{.underline}**. Reminiscent
of classical agonism\'s inclusion of the lower popular social strata
into political adversarial contests, [\'postmodern\' agonism solicits
the inclusion of difference and otherness in the public realm. Its call
for the **politicization of identities** echoes ancient agonism\'s
politicization of Narcissus. It incites a multiplicity of
particularities and cultures to participate within a common symbolic
space and **display themselves** in the course of public debate and
political strife against each other]{.underline}. Notwithstanding these
affinities and continuities, the current revival of the agon in
political theory does not suggest a nostalgic appeal to a pre-modern
Greek past. It does not indicate yet another neo-classical revival.
Quite the opposite. I would argue, it represents a \'de-Hellenization'
of agonism, a considerable divestment of its ancient significations and
a radical redefinition. At least four broad changes are involved in the
post-structural appropriation. Although they do not appear together in
all contemporary agonistic theories, they indicate certain of their most
vocal and influential properties. First, [there is a comprehensive shift
regarding the subject of the agon from the individual person to the
identity of a group, that is, to a collective entity with a shared sense
of existence]{.underline} (but see Deranty and Renault in this volume).
'[Postmodern' agonism focuses on 'contending identities\' or \'opposing
hegemonic projects' rather than concrete individuals and their
narcissistic urges]{.underline} (Connolly 1991, 166: Mouffe 2005, 21).
Whereas for the Ancients, the agon was predominantly understood and
practised in personalistic idioms, [for the contemporary proponents it
designates mostly subject positions and relationships of collective
identity formation]{.underline}. For instance, Honig (1995,155) writes
'agonistic feminism also departs from the implied individualism of
Arendt's pariah \... The identities engaged by agonistic feminists are
shared, public practices not merely markers of individual
personalities.' After the long-fought battles against the
theo-philosophy of the subject and free will, this de-centring of
ancient agonism and its disassociation from agonistic individualism
should not come as a surprise. Second, and quite predictably, the strong
connotations of masculinity and the aesthetics of manliness are
denounced and often replaced by an expressivist concept of agonistic
subjectivity, with a much greater emphasis on playfulness, virtuosity,
acting and gaming ( fully 1999; Huizinga 1950, 11). With the
'postmoderns\', the actor comes to replace the athlete: the dancer and
the flute-player supplant the wrestler and the boxer. Equally telling is
the purge of the agon from its archaic and classical invocations of
heroism. The 'postmodern' agon \'does not usually take heroism'
(Connolly 2008, 209); it seeks to be post- or anti-heroic. It does not
describe extraordinary acts and exceptional endeavours beyond measure.
And although an aesthetical appreciation is still expressed in certain
agonistic theories today, something their critics are always eager to
point out. it is of an altogether different kind. Neither masculine nor
martial, ['postmodern' agonism seems at times to indulge in the
celebration of diversity, fluid identities and dissension]{.underline}.
Third, [the concrete outcome of ancient contest, the telos of the agon -
**to win by defeating one\'s opponents is** almost **being displaced in
favour of** the more abstract notion of **disruption**, **subversion,
and perpetual contestation of** existing power relations, fixed
**identities**, and closed meanings]{.underline}. Here, the reason for
this change could be the anti-teleological current in post-structural
thinking, its critique of philosophies of history and its commitment to
contingency and indeterminacy. Whereas in antiquity the political agon
was intrinsically related to victory and success and as a type of
performance it clearly consisted of instrumental and utilitarian
significations, in contemporary theories [agonism becomes conflated to
**pure performativity**. independently of concrete
outcomes]{.underline}. Fourth, [the gains or benefits of agonism have
also shifted. From a **positive contest** for greatness, glory and
prominence, the agon is mostly converted into a **reactive resistance**
against the negative and anti-political forces of rational consensus,
deliberation, neutrality and abstract universalism, often associated to
liberal normative discourses. The broader agonistic effects of social
admiration and praise are retrofitted and transformed into a struggle
for inclusion, recognition and respect]{.underline} (Connolly 1995b,
note 40, 235). In certain cases, however, this transfiguration retains
some of its past connotations, as for instance in Honig\'s (1995, 159)
suggestion for an alternative reading of 'distinction\*, which draws
nearer to the Ancients: 'The agonal passion for distinction, which so
moved Arendt's theoretical account, may also be read as a struggle for
individuation, for emergence as a distinct self.\' [These]{.underline}
four [moves away from ancient democratic agonism suggest a radical
re-orientation toward questions of power and culture, identity formation
and exclusion]{.underline}. What the anthropological narcissistic drive
was for the ancients, identity and its exclusion are for the
'postmodems\*. [Hence, a key theoretical innovation of the 'postmodern'
accounts is to have brought into attention the relevance of identity and
difference to agonistic politics. Agonal democracy, in its various
guises, addresses the possibility of constructing a relatively stable,
plural and inclusive political order without generating sameness and an
oppressive consensus, that is, without eradicating disagreement and
contestation in the name of an over-assertive and universal good, it is
still participatory and democratic]{.underline}. Politicization and
conflict become the vital mechanisms of political inclusion and social
integration in the face of pluralism and diversity. The 'postmodern\*
agon provides a relative solution to this predicament as the classical
agon was a solution to the conundrum of narcissism and civic virtue, the
tension between the drive for pre-eminence and the principle of
equality. For contemporary approaches, exclusion represents the main
threat to politics. Against this risk, agonistic contest is treated as a
force that disturbs, relativizes and de-naturalizes the fixity of
established identities, allowing for a more hospitable and inclusive
attitude toward the other. Agonistic practices, it is argued, 'challenge
existing distributions of power, disrupt the hegemonic social, and
proliferate political spaces when they interrupt the routine,
predictability, and repetition on which \... dominant patterns of
private realm identity depend\' (Honig 1993b, 532; Connolly 1991, 193,
200). Inclusion and respect for the other is the ultimate prize of this
kind of agonism and democracy is praised for the space it creates within
which a greater expression of identities is realized through their
confrontational interactions. 'Postmodern' agonism, therefore, expresses
the hope that the politicization of difference and the intensification
of strife will foster inclusion, secure plurality, and safeguard
differences (Honig 1993b, 532; Connolly 2004, 510-11). In its strongest
version, agonism cultivates an ethical respect for one\'s opponent and
keeps open the politics of renewal and augmentation. William Connolly
expresses this faith better than anyone else, when he asserts that: in a
democratic, pluralizing ethos, agents of enactment would exercise a
certain forbearance in pressing their claims, and agents of reception
would exercise a reciprocal generosity in responding to productions that
disrupt what they arc. This agonistic reciprocity is the pathos of
distance in politics. (Connolly 1995b, 193; see also, Connolly 2005,
123-8) This optimism is coupled by a dear normative orientation, shared
by most agonistic theories today. Democratic agonism does not seek to
describe real existing democracies but rather to point at a normative
vision. Democracy ought to be a permanent and open-ended contest among
identities and particularities struggling over self-affirmation,
recognition, inclusion, power distribution and the definition of
collective meaning. If one probes deeper, one discovers that this
normative ideal is derived from the fundamental value ascribed to the
principle of the greatest inclusion of differences, which itself
presupposes a particular ontology of life. Life is abundant, plural and
rich and so should be the best political regime. This celebration of
otherness and the worth of its inclusion in the public realm is perhaps
one of the most original aspects of contemporary agonistic theories
compared to the Ancients. It is here that the departure from ancient
democratic agonism becomes more poignant. I only can briefly clarify
certain crucial points of divergence, in need of further elaboration
elsewhere. The first pertains to [a certain optimism of the 'postmodern'
agonists]{.underline} that departs significantly from the pessimism that
informed ancicnt agonistic culture. This discrepancy is due, I think, to
the fact that contemporary theories have [disassociated the agon from
the logic of **winning and losing**, of victory and defeat, pain and
agony. It is as if no one wins and, respectively, no one loses; or
better, for the 'postmodems' everybody wins. The experience of defeat is
eliminated from the democratic agon and with it the **feelings of shame
and humiliation**, **stigmatization and inner exclusion**]{.underline}
which the ancient agon generated. [**Also lost is the motivation for
victory**, with its symbolic pleasures, libidinal investment and civic
rewards]{.underline}. Likewise, contemporary discourses on agonism, with
the exception of Chantal Mouffe, have done away with the realistic
attitude of the Ancients toward the inexorable presence of Narcissus in
the human and the individual urge to distinguish oneself from others. It
should be reminded that ancient democratic agonism was primarily a form
of a necessary, pragmatic accommodation informed by a mytho-
philosophical anthropology. It was based on a descriptive understanding
of human nature and for this reason it lacked the celebration of
otherness that is so central to contemporary approaches. In fact,
agonistic theories today assume that conflict will mostly be good and
advantageous as they interconnect and bind rivals together and cultivate
respect among contending identities. This assumption, however, remains
to be proven. What guarantees that conflict will make identities more
receptive and respectful to otherness instead of inducing them to an
existential entrenchment by closing up on themselves in an effort to
defend their views, values, and ways of life, especially when they are
confronted with more powerful identities? [Disagreement and
confrontation might as well accentuate differences by making collective
identities better realize what they do not share with others and what
unique beliefs and axiological world-views distinguish them from their
opponents]{.underline} (Wenman 2003, 172-4). Agonism could as well
foster exclusion rather than inclusion. It is not clear, therefore, why
conflict destabilizes and challenges the fixity of group identities,
encouraging the inclusion of and respect for ethical and cultural
differences. [Politicization could lead to polarization, the
polemization of political contests, to **hostility and aggression**, and
finally to **factionalization** and **violent dissolution**]{.underline}
(Deveaux 1999, 15; Schaap 2007, 68). [This precisely is what many
thinkers and historians in the course of Western political theory
perceived as the fatal cause of the decline of ancient
democracies]{.underline}. [For this reason the Ancients developed a
complex institutional system, what I described as a counter-narcissistic
legal apparatus, to contain the agony of agonism as they were worried
about the destructive effects of the agon. The 'postmoderns' do not
exhibit the same institutional imagination]{.underline} as they
primarily share a positive view of political contest and public
confrontation. Hence, an institutional and legal deficit is evident in
their approaches. Adopting a rather abstract and normative discourse
they tend to subordinate political reality and the intricacies of
institutional design to philosophical speculation. As a result, the
institutionalization of agonal democracy remains an unfulfilled promise
(Schaap 2007, 68-9). Finally, by eliminating Narcissus from the agon,
'postmodern' theories dispense with a theory of civic motivation like
the one developed by the Ancients. Given the fact that the agonistic
politics of confrontation and contestation might be quite demanding,
arduous and sometimes painful, contemporary perspectives cannot account
for those who might chose a more passive, peaceful, and tranquil non-
political life. Especially so, when 'postmodern\' agonism endorses
plural identities, which means, it accepts a plurality of cultural,
ethical and religious groups, some which may not appreciate the
political life of the agon as fitting to their particular world-views,
values and beliefs. Would then democratic agonism appeal to the
superiority of a singular concept of the good, that of the agon, at the
detriment of all those identities that opt for a non-agonistic,
consensual, even private life (Deveaux 1999, 5; Connolly 2008, 210)?
**[Without]{.underline}** the passions of the Narcissus and [**an
appropriate institutional structure that drives individuals to compete**
and struggle for greatness by participating and accomplishing positive
deeds for their political community, 'postmodern' theories of agonism
face an important challenge: to reconcile the worth of the agon with a
plurality of identities that may not be as sympathetic or inclined to
confrontational and argumentative politics]{.underline}. [These
differences between the two kinds of democratic agonism, however, should
not be overstated nor projected to the entire range of 'postmodern'
agonistic theories. In fact, in one particular version]{.underline} the
spirit [of classical democratic agonism re-asserts itself]{.underline},
even if indirectly and reluctantly. Mere I have in mind [Chantal
Mouffe's work]{.underline}, which [**stands apart from the other
theories of agonism** although it certainly shares certain central
ontological and political attributes]{.underline}. Mouffe's approach is
[predominantly pragmatic rather than normative or celebratory and here
lies its core affinity with the Ancients and its disagreement with her
contemporaries. The value and merit of democratic agonism does **not
pertain merely to how inclusive it is or how many differences it
incorporates** into the public sphere]{.underline}. [Instead, Mouffe
recognizes the inexorable fact of exclusion and its necessary role in
consolidating collective identities and political unity]{.underline}.
Contrary to other contemporary thinkers of democratic agonism.
[Mouffe]{.underline} (2005, 15-16) [takes seriously the irreducibility
of an outside that can neither be fully incorporated, eradicated or
repressed]{.underline}. And since there is no objective, transcendental
or rational ground to reconcile or overcome differences, antagonism
remains ineradicable in political life, an everlasting presence and
challenge to politics. [For Mouffe, the main task of radical democracy
is to allow agonism while taming and containing antagonism. Agonism is
precisely what makes possible the conflictual character of politics
without falling into a destructive war of all against all. By turning
the enemy into an adversary and antagonism into agonism, democracy
enables a regulated conflict among competing hegemonic projects to
unfold while taming its disruptive and destructive
tendencies]{.underline} (Mouffe 2005,20): Envisaged from the point of
view of 'agonistic pluralism\', [the aim of democratic politics is to
construct the 'them' in such a way that is no longer perceived as an
enemy to be destroyed but as an adversary, that is, somebody **whose
ideas we combat but whose right to defend those ideas we do not put into
question**]{.underline}. (Mouffe 2000. 102) [Mouffe's agonistic
democracy seeks to avoid both de-politicization and over- politicization
in an effort to keep political confrontation alive without being
destroyed by it. The agon, which **occupies a middle position between
deliberative models of rational consensus on the one hand and identity
politics on the other**, aims at deflating conflicts through inclusion
and politicization but without erasing them]{.underline}. Reminiscent of
the Ancients' realism that the narcissistic passion to excel may engulf
politics if left to its own devices, Mouffe's (2005. 21) version is
predicated on a similar prudential rule that 'antagonistic conflicts are
less likely to emerge as long as agonistic legitimate political channels
for dissenting voices exist' (but see Breen in this volume). In
addition, [by directly discussing the role and significance of passions
and affects in politics]{.underline}, Mouffe moves closer to the
Ancients with [her psychoanalytically oriented approach]{.underline}
that [takes into consideration the libidinal forces of
identification]{.underline}, reminiscent of the force of Narcissus.
[Agonistic democracy **acknowledges the libidinal pleasure of
identification while it seeks to curb its dangerous and violent
impulses**. 'Understood in an agonistic way', she claims, 'democratic
institutions can contribute to this **disarming of the libidinal forces
leading towards hostility** which are always present in human
societies']{.underline} (MoufTe 2005, 26). Without the good Eris
(agonism/the adversary) there is only a bad Eris (antagonism/the enemy).
[Agonal plural democracy aims to transform conflict into a form of
**regulated** public contest in order **to avoid the eruption of violent
antagonisms into politics**]{.underline}. Thus, Mouffe's pragmatic and
realist theory of plural [c]{.underline} democracy, informed by a
similar awareness of the threatening and unpredictable potentialities of
the political, retains certain affinities with classical democratic
agonism, mediating between Ancients and 'postmodems'.

### A2: FW Is Policing

#### Arguments stand or fall based on whether they are good -- nothing more nothing less -- the negatives argument isn't policing 

**Anderson, Professor of Humanities and English at Brown University, 6**

\[Amanda Anderson , Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Humanities and English
at Brown University, Spring 2006, "Reply to My Critic(s)," Criticism,
Vol. 48, No. 2, p. 281-290, AMM\]

Lets first examine the claim that my book is \"unwittingly\" inviting a
resurrection of the \"Enlightenment-equals-totalitarianism position.\"
[How]{.underline}, one wonders, [could]{.underline} a book [promoting
argument and debate, and promoting reason-giving practices as
a]{.underline} kind of [common ground that should prevail over
assertions of cultural authenticity]{.underline}, [somehow come to be
seen as a]{.underline} [dangerous resurgence of bad Enlightenment?
Robbins tells us why: I want \"argument on my own terms\"-that is, I
want to impose reason on people, which is a form of power and
oppression]{.underline}. [But what can this possibly mean? Arguments
stand or fall]{.underline} [based on whether they are successful and
persuasive, even an argument in favor of argument]{.underline}. [It
simply is not the case that an argument in favor of the importance of
reasoned debate to liberal democracy is]{.underline} [tantamount to
oppressive power]{.underline}. To assume so is to assume, in the manner
of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, that reason is itself violent,
inherently, and that it will always mask power and enforce exclusions.
But to assume this is to assume the very view of Enlightenment reason
that Robbins claims we are \"thankfully\" well rid of. (I leave to the
side the idea that any individual can proclaim that a debate is over,
thankfully or not.) But [perhaps Robbins will say, \"I am not imagining
that your argument is directly oppressive, but that]{.underline} [what
you argue for would be, if it were enforced.\" Yet my book doesn\'t
imagine]{.underline} or [suggest it is enforceable; I
simply]{.underline} [argue in favor of, I promote]{.underline}, [an
ethos of argument within a liberal democratic]{.underline} and
[proceduralist framework]{.underline}. As much as Robbins would like to
think so, [neither I nor the books I write can be cast as an arm of the
police]{.underline}. Robbins wants to imagine a far more direct line of
influence from criticism to political reality, however, and this is why
it can be such a bad thing to suggest norms of argument. Watch as the
gloves come off: Faced with the prospect of submitting to her version of
argument roughly, Habermass version-and of being thus authorized to
disagree only about other, smaller things, some may feel that there will
have been an end to argument, or an end to the arguments they find most
interesting. With current events in mind, I would be surprised if there
were no recourse to the metaphor of a regular army facing a guerilla
insurrection, hinting that Anderson wants to force her opponents to
dress in uniform, reside in well-demarcated camps and capitals that can
be bombed, fight by the rules of states (whether the states themselves
abide by these rules or not), and so on-in short, that she wants to get
the battle onto a terrain where her side will be assured of having the
upper hand. Lets leave to the side the fact that this is a disowned
hypothetical criticism. (As in, \"Well, okay, yes, those are my gloves,
but those are somebody elses hands they will have come off of.\")
Because far more interesting, actually, is the sudden elevation of
stakes. [It is a]{.underline} symptom of the [sorry state of
affairs]{.underline} in our profession [that]{.underline} it [plays
out]{.underline} repeatedly [this]{.underline} [tragicomic tendency to
give a grandiose]{.underline} political [meaning to every
object]{.underline} it analyzes or confronts. We have evidence of how
desperate the situation is when we see it in a critic as thoughtful as
Bruce Robbins, where it emerges as the need to [allegorize]{.underline}
a point about [an argument in such a way that it gets cast as the
equivalent of war atrocities.]{.underline} [It is especially ironic in
light of the fact that to the extent that I do give examples of the
importance of liberal democratic proceduralism, I invoke the disregard
of the protocols of international adjudication in the days leading up to
the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}; I also speak about concerns with
voting transparency. [It is]{.underline} [hard]{.underline} for me [to
see how my argument about proceduralism]{.underline} [can be associated
with the policies of the Bush administration]{.underline} [when that
administration]{.underline} has [exhibited a flagrant disregard of
democratic procedure and the rule of law]{.underline}. I happen to think
that [a renewed focus on proceduralism is a timely venture]{.underline},
which is why I spend so much time discussing it in my final chapter.
[But]{.underline} I hasten to add that [I am not]{.underline} interested
in [imagining that proceduralism is the sole political response to the
needs of cultural criticism in our time: my goal]{.underline} in the
book [is to argue for a]{.underline} [liberal democratic culture of
argument]{.underline}, [and to suggest ways in which argument is not
served by trumping appeals to identity and charismatic
authority]{.underline}. I fully admit that my examples are less
political events than academic debates; for those uninterested in the
shape of intellectual arguments, and eager for more direct and sustained
discussion of contemporary politics, the approach will disappoint.
Moreover, there will always be a tendency for a proceduralist to
under-specify substance, and that is partly a principled decision, since
the point is that agreements, compromises, and policies get worked out
through the communicative and political process. My book is mainly
concentrated on evaluating forms of arguments and appeals to ethos, both
those that count as a form of trump card or distortion, and those that
flesh out an understanding of argument as a universalist practice. There
is an intermittent appeal to larger concerns in the political democratic
culture, and that is because I see connections between the ideal of
argument and the ideal of deliberative democracy. But there is clearly,
and indeed necessarily, significant room for further elaboration here.

#### Effective argumentation is better able to create broader inclusion\-\--radical rejection of existing systems as exclusionary is ineffective and reductionist

In closing, I\'d like to speak briefly to the question of
proceduralism\'s relevance to democratic vitality. One important way of
extending the proceduralist arguments put forth by Habeimas is to work
on how institutions and practices might better promote participation in
democratic life. The [apathy and nonparticipation plaguing democratic
institutions in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is a
serious problem, and can be]{.underline} **[separated
from]{.underline}** the more romantic theoretical investments in a
refusal to accept the terms of what counts as argument, or in
**[assertions of inassimilable difference]{.underline}**. With respect
to [the latter]{.underline}, which [is often glorified precisely as the
moment when politics or democracy is truly occurring]{.underline}, I
would say, [on the contrary]{.underline} **[democracy is not happening
then]{.underline}**-[rather, the]{.underline} limits or **[deficiencies
of an actually existing democracy are making themselves
felt]{.underline}**. [Acknowledging struggle, conflict, and exclusion is
vital to democracy, but]{.underline} [insisting that exclusion is not so
much a persistent challenge for modern liberal democracies but
rather]{.underline} [inherent to the modern liberal-democratic political
form as such]{.underline} [seems]{.underline} to me **[precisely to
remain stalled in a romantic critique of Enlightenment]{.underline}**.
[It]{.underline} all [comes down to a question of]{.underline} [whether
one wants to work with the ideals of democracy or see them as
essentially normative in a negative sense]{.underline}: [this has been
the legacy of a certain critique of Enlightenment, and it is
astonishingly persistent in the left quarters in the
academy]{.underline}. [One hears it clearly when Robbins
makes]{.underline} confident [reference to liberalisms tendency to
ignore \"the founding acts of violence on which a social order is
based]{.underline}.\" One encounters it in the current vogue for the
work of Giorgio Agamben and Carl Schmitt. [Saying that a state of
exception defines modernity or is internal to the law itself
may]{.underline} help to [sharpen your diagnoses of certain historical
conditions,]{.underline} [but **if absolutized**]{.underline} as it is
in these accounts, [it gives you nothing]{.underline} [but a negative
diagnostic and a **compensatory flight** to a realm entirely
other-the]{.underline} kind of [mystical, Utopian impulse that **flees
from these conditions rather than confronts and fights
them**]{.underline} [on terms that derive from the]{.underline}
settled-if constantly evolving-[normative basis of democratic
modernity.]{.underline} [If one is outraged by the flagrant disregard of
democratic procedures in the current U.S. political regime]{.underline},
then [one needs to be able to coherently say why democratic procedures
matter]{.underline}, [what principles underwrite them, and
what]{.underline} historical movements and [institutions have helped us
to secure and support them]{.underline}. [Argument as a critical
practice]{.underline} [and as a]{.underline} **[key component of
democratic institutions and public debate has a vital role to play in
such a task.]{.underline}**

### A2: Identity Key 

#### Identity is obviously valuable to discussion, but to reduce identity to the point where it inhibits intersubjective dialogue about the resolution amounts to [cultural reductionism]{.underline} that makes communal democratic politics impossible 

Amanda **Anderson 6**, prof of English at Johns Hopkins The Way We Argue
Now, 2-5

At the same time, however, the book engages in an internal critique of
certain tendencies within the field of theory. [These
essays]{.underline} repeatedly [draw attention to the]{.underline}
underdeveloped and often [incoherent evaluative stance of contemporary
theory, its inability to clearly]{.underline} [avow the norms and values
underlying its own critical programs]{.underline}. In particular, [I
contest the prevalent skepticism about the possibility]{.underline} or
desirability [of achieving reflective distance on one\'s social or
cultural positioning]{.underline}. [As a result of poststructuralism\'s
insistence on]{.underline} the forms of
[finitude]{.underline}\--linguistic, psychological, and cultural\--[that
limit individual agency]{.underline}, and multiculturalism\'s insistence
on the primacy of ascribed group identity and its accompanying
perspectives, [the concept of critical distance has been seriously
discredited]{.underline}, **[even as it necessarily informs many of the
very accounts that announce its]{.underline} ¶** 2¶ [**bankruptcy.** The
alliance between the poststructuralist]{.underline} [critique of reason
and the]{.underline} form of [sociological reductionism that governs the
politics of identity threatens to **undermine the vitality of both
academic and political debate insofar as it becomes impossible to
explore shared forms of rationality**]{.underline}. Given these
conditions, in fact, this book might well have been called \"The Way We
Fail to Argue Now.\"2¶ To counter the tendencies of both
poststructuralism and identity politics, I advance a renewed assessment
of the work of philosopher Jürgen Habermas, whose interrelated theories
of communicative action, discourse ethics, and democratic proceduralism
have provoked continued and often dismissive critique from theorists in
the fields of literary studies, cultural studies, and political theory.
[The book is in no way an uncritical embrace of Habermas\'s
theory]{.underline}, however. [Rather, it offers a renewed assessment of
the notions of critical distance and procedural democracy]{.underline}
in light of the arguments that have been waged against them. In part I
do this by giving airtime to those debates in which Habermas and
like-minded critics have engaged poststructuralism. But I also try to
give Habermas a new hearing by showing the ways in which [his theories
promote]{.underline} an understanding of [reflective
distance]{.underline} [as an achieved and lived]{.underline}
[practice]{.underline}, [one with an intimate bearing on questions of
ethos and character. Typically dismissed as impersonal]{.underline},
abstract, [and arid]{.underline}, [rational discourse]{.underline} of
the kind associated with the neo-Kantianism of Habermas and his
followers [is often employed as a contrast to valorized ideals of
embodied identities,]{.underline} feelings and passions, ethics and
politics\--in short, all the values that are seen to imbue theoretical
practice with existential meaningfulness and moral force. [This very
opposition, which has effectively structured many]{.underline}
[influential academic debates]{.underline}, **[involves a serious
misreading and reduction of the rationalist tradition]{.underline}**,
[which]{.underline} at its most compelling [seeks]{.underline} precisely
[to understand communicative reason and the aspiration to critical
distance as an **embedded practice**, as an **ongoing achievement rather
than a fantasmatic imposition**]{.underline}. [This
aspiration]{.underline}, moreover, also [characterizes]{.underline}
collective forms of [liberal politics, including the practices and
procedures that constitute the democratic tradition and are so vital to
its ongoing health and stability.¶]{.underline} More generally, and
throughout the book, I draw out the practical ¶ 3¶ imagination of
theories in order to contest the assumption that theory is overly
abstract, irrelevant, or elitist and to draw attention to an all but
ubiquitous pull, even in theories from very different and even
antagonistic traditions, toward questions of embodiment and
enactment\--questions of practice, that is. With varying degrees of
explicitness and self-awareness, I argue, contemporary theories present
themselves as ways of living, as practical philosophies with both
individualist and collective aspirations. Indeed, many recent
theoretical projects join in a desire to correct for, or answer to, the
overly abstract elements of earlier forms of theory. This movement
manifests itself in various and not entirely commensurate ways; within
literary studies, to take a central example, it appears in a keen
attention to the social position of writers, readers, and characters, an
increasing focus on the sensibility or location of the critic or
theorist, and a concern with the ethics of reading and criticism more
broadly. It is my contention that these developments reflect a
persistent existential movement toward thicker characterological
conceptions of theoretical postures and stances, though it is rarely put
in these terms. Indeed, the interest in characterological enactment
often operates below the radar, or with only half-lit awareness. One
symptom of the underdeveloped yet nonetheless insistent nature of this
aspect of contemporary theory is the fact that the term \"ethos,\" which
reflects a general interest in the ethical texture of theory\'s project,
appears regularly across recent work in literature and political
theory.3¶ I am interested in exploring this turn toward the existential
dimensions of theory, claiming it as a kind of dialectical advance, and
using it to reconsider our understanding of those forms of political
theory\--rationalism and proceduralism\--that have been framed as most
ethos-deficient. But the story is somewhat more complicated and
internally contested than this brief summary might lead one to expect.
These complexities have largely to do with a point I raised at the
outset: namely, that highly constrained sociological forms have governed
the analysis of subjectivity and personal experience in literary and
cultural studies after poststructuralism. In the late 1980s, an interest
in first-person perspectives and in the lived experiences of diverse
social groups emerged among critics who felt that the high altitudes at
which theory operated failed to capture the density and meaningfulness
of individual and collective life. There were a series of famous
\"confessional writings\" by critics, which ¶ 4¶ often opposed
themselves to theoretical approaches.4 Within theory itself, there was
also an increasing attention to subjective effects and enactment, and a
subsequent tendency to focus the lens on the middle distance and the
close up, to relinquish the panoramas and the aerial views. Thus, not
only did a new subjectivism emerge in opposition to theory, it also
began to affect theory itself as an internal pressure. The most telling
example here would be the dramatic late turn in the work of Michel
Foucault, which set aside the far-reaching examinination of modern power
and modern institutions to explore the \"care of the self\" within
antiquity and, to a lesser degree, within modernity, as well. While
Foucault\'s previous work had been interested in the forms of
subjectivity engendered by modern disciplinary power, the later Foucault
was interested in the manner in which individuals understood, conducted,
and therefore in some sense owned, their moral, social, and physical
lives.5¶ What should be noted about much of this work on the individual
subject, however, is that it gave preeminence to sociological or group
identity\--varionsly defined by the categories of class, race,
ethnicity, nationality, gender, and sexuality. One of the recurrent
themes of this book is that a [narrow understanding of selfhood and
practice results from an overemphasis on sociological, ascribed, or
group identity]{.underline}. Intellectual practices over the past
several decades have been profoundly enriched and advanced through
analysis of the ways that identity categories shape bodies of knowledge,
cultural life, and relations of power. But it is also the case that
[contemporary forms of sociological and **cultural reductionism** limit
how critics and theorists imagine the relation between intellectual and
ethicopolitical life]{.underline}.6 [The conviction that identity is
fundamentally ¶]{.underline} 5¶ status-based, [pregiven]{.underline} [in
some fundamental way]{.underline} by the groups or categories that make
up the sociological map, **[constrains the resources of practical and
ethical discourses in key ways]{.underline}**.7 This discursive poverty
is evidenced by the two ethicopolitical options that often seem to be on
offer: on the one hand, there is a strong theoretical tradition,
deriving from poststructuralism and queer theory, that advocates the
subversion of identity by any means possible\--the denaturalization of
what are nonetheless inescapably imposed identities by means of parody,
irony, or resignification.8 On the other hand, by those more interested
in the virtues of mosaic diversity and more convinced of the importance
of socialized belonging, there is a quasi-communitarian commitment to
the notion that forms of cultural affiliation must be acknowledged,
defended, or cushioned, particularly from what is seen as the evacuating
force of liberal or rational agendas.9¶ The \"politics of
[identity]{.underline}\" (to suggest something less reified and
discredited than \"identity politics\") [is]{.underline} a theoretically
and [practically]{.underline} [significant]{.underline} dimension of
contemporary historical and sociological life. [It is not
my]{.underline} [aim]{.underline} or desire [to]{.underline} somehow
[argue it out of existence]{.underline} (as though that were possible).
[But limitations ensue when the politics of identity is imagined to
cover all available intellectual and ethicopolitical space.]{.underline}
[The privileging of]{.underline} only those forms of
[critique]{.underline} that are [associated with]{.underline} the
[postmodern]{.underline} modes of irony and negative
[freedom]{.underline}, moreover, [results in a]{.underline} [widespread
and deleterious rejection of]{.underline} the [resources]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the Kantian and [liberal traditions]{.underline}. [I
question the assumptions fueling this recurrent bias and advance a
defense of critical reason, discourse ethics, and those political forms
and institutions that seek reflectively to realize liberal and
democratic principles]{.underline}.¶ From a somewhat different but
equally important angle, I explore how contemporary theory is already
pursuing a less constrained understanding

Argue Now, 25-8)

25¶ Whether such a procedural approach actually helps to yield any
[substantive normative guidance]{.underline} is an issue of debate.
Habermas has sought to justify communicative ethics [through appeal to
the principles of respect and **reciprocity**]{.underline} that he
claims are inherent in linguistic practices geared toward reaching
understanding. [Attempt]{.underline}ing [to redress the]{.underline}
**[overwhelmingly negative forms of critique]{.underline}**
[characteristic of]{.underline} both the Frankfurt School and
[poststructuralist traditions,]{.underline} [he argues that the
logocentrism of Western thought and the]{.underline} powerful
[instrumentality of reason are not absolute but rather
constitute]{.underline} ["a systematic foreshortening and distortion of
a potential always already operative in the communicative practice of
everyday life]{.underline}." [The potential]{.underline} he refers to
[is the potential for mutual]{.underline} [understanding "inscribed into
communication in ordinary language]{.underline}." 7 [Habermas
acknowledges the dominance]{.underline} and reach [of instrumental
reason]{.underline}---[his project is largely devoted to a]{.underline}
[systematic analysis of the]{.underline} historical
[conditions]{.underline} and social effects [of that]{.underline}
[dominance]{.underline}---[yet]{.underline} at the same time [he wishes
to retrieve an **emancipatory model of communicative**]{.underline}¶ ¶
26¶ **[reason derived from a linguistic understanding of intersubjective
relations]{.underline}**. As Benhabib argues, this form of communicative
action, embodied in the highly controversial and pervasively
misunderstood concept of the "ideal speech situation," entails strong
ethical assumptions, namely the principles of universal moral respect
and egalitarian reciprocity (SS, 29).¶ Habermas has famously argued that
[he does not believe any metaphysical grounding of such norms is
possible]{.underline}; [he insists instead that]{.underline} [we view
the **normative constraints of**]{.underline} the ideal **[speech
community]{.underline}** [as "**universal** **pragmatic**
**presuppositions**"]{.underline} of competent moral actors who have
reached the postconventional stage of moral reasoning. Habermas's theory
combines a "weak transcendental argument" concerning the four types of
validity claims operative in speech acts with an empirical
reconstruction of psychosocial development derived from Lawrence
Kohlberg. [Benhabib]{.underline}, though she, too, appeals to
socialization processes, distinguishes her position from Habermas's
"weak transcendental argument" by [promot]{.underline}ing
[a]{.underline} "historically **[self-conscious
universalism]{.underline}**" [that locates the ethical]{.underline}
[principles of **respect and reciprocity** as "constituents of the moral
point of view]{.underline} from within the normative hermeneutic horizon
of modernity" (SS, 30). [Benhabib]{.underline}'s work thus [constitutes,
like Habermas's, a strong defense of]{.underline} specific
potentialities of [modernity]{.underline}. She [differs]{.underline}
from him [in two key respects]{.underline}, besides the emphasis already
outlined. First, she believes that [Habermas's emphasis]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} [consensus]{.underline} seriously [distorts his account
of communicative ethics]{.underline}. [Like others who have **argued
against the conflation of understanding and consensus**]{.underline},
[Benhabib champions]{.underline} instead [a discourse model of ethics
that is geared toward **keeping the conversation going**:¶ **When we
shift the burden of the moral test** in communicative ethics from
consensus to the idea of an **ongoing**]{.underline} moral
[**conversation**,]{.underline} **[we begin to ask not what all
would]{.underline}** or could [**agree** to as a result of practical
discourses **to be morally permissible** or
**impermissible**]{.underline}, **[but what would be
allowed]{.underline}** and perhaps even necessary **[from the standpoint
of continuing and sustaining the practice of the]{.underline}** moral
**[conversation]{.underline}** among us. [The emphasis now is less on
rational agreement, but more on **sustaining those
normative**]{.underline} **[practices]{.underline}** and moral
relationships **[within which reasoned agreement as a way of life can
flourish]{.underline}** and continue. (SS, 38)8¶ ¶ 27¶ The second
significant difference between Habermas and Benhabib is that Benhabib
rejects Habermas's rigid opposition between justice and the good life,
an opposition that effectively relegates identity-based politics to a
lower plane of moral practice, and that for [Benhabib]{.underline}
undercuts our ability to apprehend the radical particularity of the
other. While she believes in the importance of self-reflexive
interrogations of conventional identities and roles, she strongly
[opposes any]{.underline} ethics or [politics that privileges
the]{.underline} unencumbered or [detached self over the concrete,
embodied,]{.underline} situated [self]{.underline}. She argues in
particular against those liberal models that imagine that conversations
of moral justification should take place between individuals who have
bracketed their strongest cultural or social identifications and
attachments. Instead [she promotes what she calls an "interactive
universalism":]{.underline}¶ [Interactive universalism acknowledges the
plurality of modes of being human, and differences among
humans]{.underline}, [without endorsing all]{.underline} [these
pluralities]{.underline} and differences [as]{.underline} morally and
politically [valid]{.underline}. [While agreeing that normative disputes
can be settled rationally, **and** that **fairness, reciprocity and some
procedure of universalizability are**]{.underline} constituents, that
is, **[necessary conditions]{.underline}** of the moral standpoint,
[interactive universalism regards difference as a starting point for
reflection]{.underline} and action. [In this sense, **"universality" is
a regulative ideal that does not deny our embodied**]{.underline} and
embedded **[identity]{.underline}**, [but aims at
developing]{.underline} [moral attitudes and **encouraging political
transformations that can yield a point of view acceptable to
all**]{.underline}. [Universality is not]{.underline} the ideal
[consensus]{.underline} of fictitiously defined selves, [but the
concrete **process in politics**]{.underline} and morals of the struggle
of concrete, embodied selves, striving for autonomy. (SS, 153) ¶ This
passage encapsulates the core of [Benhabib's position]{.underline},
which [attempts to mediate between universalism and
particularism]{.underline} as traditionally understood. [On the one
hand, universalism's informing principles of rational argumentation,
fairness, and reciprocity adjudicate between different positions in the
ethicopolitical realm]{.underline}, [enabling crucial distinctions
between]{.underline} those [notions of the good life]{.underline} [that
promote interactive universalism and those that threaten its key
principles]{.underline}. It insists, in other words, that there is a
specifiable moral standpoint from which---to take a few prominent
examples---Serbian aggression, neo-Nazism, and gay bashing can be
definitively condemned. [On the other hand, universalism "regards
difference as a starting point."]{.underline} [It understands identity
as "embodied]{.underline} and embedded" [and promotes encounters with
otherness]{.underline} so as [to nurture]{.underline} the development of
[a moral attitude]{.underline} [that will "yield a point of view
acceptable to all."¶ **Of course it must simultaneously be recognized
that the "all" here cannot coherently include those who
have**]{.underline}, according to universalism's own principles,
**[forfeited their place as equal participants in the
ethicopolitical]{.underline}¶** ¶ 28¶ **[community]{.underline}**.
Ironically, then, Benhabib's [redefinition of universalism insists on
inevitable exclusion]{.underline}, **[but not in the sense
that]{.underline}** many **[poststructuralist]{.underline}** and
postmodernist cultural **[critics]{.underline}** **[do]{.underline}**,
[as the hardwired effect of universalism's false claims to
inclusiveness, and]{.underline} [as victimizing those disempowered by
race, class, gender, or sexuality]{.underline}. [**Against naive
conceptions of inclusiveness**]{.underline} and plurality,
[which]{.underline} ultimately **[prove self-undermining in their
toleration of]{.underline}** communities, individuals, and **[practices

universalism claims that certain exclusions are not only justified, but
indeed required by the principles of recognition and respect that

### Political Engagement Necessary

#### Engagement with political systems is necessary to yield effective reform---proven by the Small Arms Movement

[The Small Arms Movement]{.underline} Since the mid-1990s, [a
transnational effort to address the problems associated with small arms
and light weapons has emerged]{.underline}. [Nongovernmental actors have
been involved]{.underline}, to varying degrees, in a number of small
arms initiatives ranging from fact-finding missions, to weapons
collection and destruction programs, to the establishment of best
practices and codes of conduct, to interstate conventions focusing on
illicit trafficking. [Working either individually or collectively, what
binds these actors together and moves them to act is their concern about
small arms as a problem for human, national, and international
security]{.underline}.

Origins

The Small Arms Movement's roots may be found in the publication of
research on the issue in 1996.43 [By the latter half of
1997]{.underline}, the small arms movement started to emerge. In
December of that year [a meeting took place in Washington, which
included representatives of 23 nongovernmental organizations working on
the small arms issue]{.underline}. After this meeting, [Ed
Laurance]{.underline} (one of the leading 'political entrepreneurs'
involved with establishing the SAM) [founded and served as the
administrator of the Preparatory Committee for a Global Campaign on
Small Arms and Light Weapons, which was created to develop an Internet
database of information on small arms activities]{.underline}.44 In 1998
there were four NGO meetings held to discuss the small arms issue, the
last two of which took place in Canada and Brussels and set the stage
for a transnational network dedicated to the issue of small arms. The
meeting in Canada joined together 33 NGOs from 18 countries, forming the
basis of the International Action Network on Small Arms. In Brussels,
more than 100 organizations met to decide on IANSA's organizational
structure and goals.45

This [growth in international contact allowed network members to
formally launch the International Action Network on Small Arms in May
1999 at The Hague, The Netherlands,]{.underline} with an overall
objective of stemming the proliferation and misuse of small arms and
light weapons in an effort to contribute to a more just and
violence-free world, sustainable peace, development, human security, and
respect for human rights.46 The IANSA network has at its core common
values concerning the problematic nature of small arms availability,
transfer, and circulation -- either from a demand or supply perspective.
The IANSA founding document is laden with value statements regarding the
human right to live in a secure environment characterized by peace,
dignity, and humanity.47 Moreover, participants in the SAM, most widely
conceived, tend to reflect a general consensus that small arms are tools
of death that fuel and increase the lethality of conflict and that such
weaponry poses various challenges for development, security, peace, and
justice.

Objectives IANSA has a number of specific goals and objectives meant to
address both weapons supply and demand. These include: (1) controlling
legal transfers between states; (2) controlling the availability, use
and storage of small arms within states; (3) preventing and combating
illicit transfers; (4) collecting and removing surplus arms from both
civil society and regions of conflict; (5) increasing transparency and
accountability; (6) supporting research and information sharing; (7)
reversing cultures of violence; (8) reforming the security sector; (9)
creating norms of non-possession; (10) enhancing demobilization and
reintegration programs; (11) halting the use of child combatants,
combating impunity; and (12) tackling poverty and underdevelopment.48

**[To achieve its goals, IANSA members certainly seek to engage in
'information', 'symbolic', 'leverage', and 'accountability'
politics.]{.underline}** [Regarding information, IANSA explicitly states
that information is key to the network.]{.underline} Via its Founding
Document, IANSA commits itself to gathering, sharing, and disseminating
information at all levels. Its policy framework sets out a plan for
supporting research and the sharing of information -- and mentions that
NGOs have a special role in independently collecting and interpreting
reliable information. IANSA documents state that the network will
identify research and evaluation needs, will encourage data collection
and dissemination among its members, and will conduct research on little
known issues and in little known regions.49 Moreover, information is
viewed as instrumentalin raising the profile of the network and its
programs, and in building and supporting constituencies. This includes
the drafting of 'culturally appropriate' messages, campaign materials,
and slogans.50

Concerning symbolism, IANSA members utilize a number of symbols and
symbolic events in achieving their objectives. The network encourages,
for example, the use of particular individuals, such as former
combatants, in educational efforts as they serve as symbols of the small
arms problem.51 Symbolic events such as weapons bonfires are important
for the network. In fact, a 'Flame of Peace' kicked off the launching of
IANSA in The Hague, where dozens of 'donated small arms were burned in a
bonfire as a symbol of IANSA participants' dedication to do their part
to tackle the difficult task of actively addressing the tools of
violence in today's conflicts'.52 IANSA also focuses symbolically on the
civilian victims of small arms and light weapons around the world. For
example, network members often raise the fact that more than 40 Red
Cross personnel were killed in the 1990s in Chechnya and Rwanda alone.
This is astonishing when you compare that number with the 15 Red Cross
volunteers who died in the line of duty between 1945 and 1990.53

[**As for leverage politics,** **IANSA's founding document states that
it seeks to enlist 'respected and popular public figures to convey
campaign messages'**.]{.underline}54 [Acknowledging that well-known and
identifiable people may affect the receptivity of the message by
officials and the public, IANSA commits itself to leveraging its work by
collaborating with more powerful actors]{.underline}. [**Linking with
powerful actors such as governments** and international organizations,
however, **may bear the most fruit**, according to many IANSA
members]{.underline}.55 In fact, [many participants actively seek out
the support of some governments, many of which have funded and supported
the small arms activities of such participants]{.underline}. Moreover,
[members have sought to establish strong ties with the United
Nations,]{.underline} which has been extremely active on the issue of
small arms proliferation and openly welcomed and applauded the creation
of IANSA.56

Regarding attempts to hold targets accountable for their promises and
actions, IANSA seeks to publicize discrepancies between target actor
statements and practices and to highlight unacceptable behavior. The
network commits itself to 'monitoring the international political and
social context of small arms' by assessing national policies, evaluating
state adherence to human rights standards, promoting nonproliferation
norms and standards of behavior, and developing mechanisms for
monitoring the implementation of local, national, regional, and
international initiatives.57 To further this commitment, IANSA compiles
a database of news publications focusing on government action and
misconduct related to small arms and publishes it on its website.

[Accomplishments]{.underline} [Ultimately, IANSA and the SAM have
achieved much over the past few years]{.underline}. Since its inception,
the [small arms issue has certainly been given more
attention]{.underline}. There are more organizations and individuals
working and concentrating on small arms problems. Regional networks have
emerged in Central and South America, West Africa, South Asia, South
East Asia, East and West Africa, and Western and Eastern Europe.58
[**IANSA was intricately involved in the** July 2001 **UN meeting**
**that led to the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate
the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its
Aspects**]{.underline}. [IANSA has also worked to include NGOs in
subsequent UN meetings]{.underline}, giving a voice to NGOs from around
the world.59 IANSA also plays a central role in evaluating member
country attempts to implement the 2001 agreement.60 Moreover, [**IANSA
has become involved in a coordinated campaign**, the Control Arms
campaign, with Amnesty International and Oxfam, in an effort **to build
support for an international Arms Trade Treaty** t**hat would 'ban arms
transfers if they are likely to contribute to human rights violations or
fuel conflict**, or undermine development'.]{.underline}61

### Precise Legal Wording Necessary

#### Determining precise legal wording is key to effective arms controls---proven by the Biological Weapons Convention

**Beard, University of Nebraska Assistant Professor of Law, 7**

\[Jack M. Beard (Contact Author), 1-1-2007, American Journal Of
International Law, \"The Shortcomings of Indeterminacy in Arms Control
Regimes: The Case of The Biological Weapons Convention,\"
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2312699, accessed
7-12-2019, //EJA\]

[The BWC is]{.underline} commonly [said to have failed because it lacks
mandatory transparency measures]{.underline} and a dedicated monitoring
organization.8 This explanation, which is well grounded in arms control
practice, international relations theory, and theoretic game models,
posits that a state actor is unlikely to forgo a particular class of
weapons permanently unless it receives assurances that adversary states
are reciprocally so committed and an effective monitoring regime is in
place to ensure against a \"surprise defection,\" that is, cheating.9
Perceived security threats and asymmetrical information may generate or
enlarge incentives for states to renege, making the Pareto-optimal
outcome of mutual disarmament decidedly unstable and transparency a
critical factor in ensuring that one state does not take advantage of
the other.\"l In spite of this recognized need for transparency, the
states parties to the BWC have been unable to agree on any mandatory
transparency measures and the United States in particular has blocked
serious efforts at reform. 1 While the lack of transparency is thus
widely cited as a reason for the BWC\'s lack of success, [this article
argues that another, equally important factor contributes to the
ineffectiveness of the BWC and other disarmament or arms control
regimes]{.underline} that operate in environments where member states
perceive their security to be threatened: [the use of indeterminate\' 2
language in key provisions,]{.underline} [a phenomenon]{.underline} that
is sometimes [characterized as a dimension of \"soft law.\"]{.underline}

There is substantial disagreement among legal scholars about the
definition, status, and role of [soft law;]{.underline} 3 however, many
argue that it considerably [influences the behavior of states and
displays significant advantages over \"hard law\"]{.underline} in
different areas of international practice.1\" The term \"soft law\" is
often used to denote principles, standards, or arrangements of a
nonlegally binding nature. 15 But the absence of formal legal obligation
is arguably only one characteristic of a continuum of softness: [the
term \"soft law\" is also used by scholars to refer to hortatory
language\' 6 and to imprecise, ambiguous, vague, or otherwise
indeterminate formulations]{.underline}, 17 [even when found in legally
binding agreements like the BWC.]{.underline} 8 Key [structural
deficiencies]{.underline} [in international agreements]{.underline},
such as the failure of the BWC to provide for any mandatory mechanisms
to enhance transparency and enforcement, [are]{.underline} also
sometimes [associated with soft law when the elements of an
international agreement are viewed as a whole]{.underline}. 9 While
these different variants of soft law are often merged to such an extent
that some scholars appear to find little reason to distinguish between
them,2° others argue that such a merger impedes the study of law\'s
relative influence on state behavior because it conflates the legally
binding nature of agreements with other issues such as their substance
or structure. 2 However it is characterized, [the fusion of a \"hard,\"
legally binding agreement with \"soft,\" indeterminate language is a
common, yet problematic, trade-off22]{.underline} [that merits separate
analysis,]{.underline} [particularly in the context of arms control
regimes]{.underline} that attempt to regulate potentially destabilizing
technology with both peaceful civilian uses and devastating military
applications. 23 This article thus focuses on indeterminate language in
legally binding agreements, which represents one choice that states may
make from a range of options for designing arms control and disarmament
regimes.

One approach to resolving indeterminate legal terms involves delegating
authority to judicial bodies to interpret ambiguous language. Since some
degree of rule indeterminacy is common in the domestic context, judges
in domestic courts are often called upon to apply and interpret broad
standards or to engage in the case-by-case administration ofjustice.2 \"
Similarly, some international adjudicative bodies may also apply broad
standards that require considerable interpretation and filling in of
gaps.2 \' The resolution by third-party adjudication, however, of issues
arising from indeterminate language in the arms control context
generally represents an unacceptable threat to the sovereignty and
national security of states, particularly the most powerful ones. State
actors operating in an anarchic and unforgiving security environment
pursue policies with respect to international cooperation on the basis
of their own selfinterested motives or preferences, 26 and so approach
disarmament regimes and other restrictions in the \"high politics\"
arena of war and peace with great suspicion. While states may conclude
that their interests are advanced by joining security regimes, the terms
of governing international agreements are invariably subject to scrutiny
and compromise. In this regard, states-especially the most powerful
states, which are accustomed to setting the rules of most international
regimes according to their interests27-are generally unwilling and
unlikely to entrust their most important security interests to other
states or to adjudication by international institutions.28

In view of the high stakes associated with international security
cooperation, it is useful to assess the design of arms control regimes
in the context of preferences that may underlie selfinterested state
behavior. [This article undertakes such an assessment and uses the BWC
to explore the choices states make along a continuum of options that
include various dimensions of soft and hard law]{.underline}. In doing
so, [it illuminates the hazards of choosing indeterminate language to
perform critical regime functions amid unstable security
conditions.]{.underline}

Many scholars proclaim the virtues of soft law, including that dimension
characterized by indeterminacy of language. [In the area of arms
control,]{.underline} some suggest that different types of soft law may
at least be no less effective than hard law, especially when widely
supported norms are involved,2 9 or that they may in fact offer distinct
advantages over hard law.30 [While indeterminate language may serve as a
useful tool for states in certain negotiations and agreements, this
article shows **that it is fatal to the success of arms control in
general**]{.underline}, and multilateral disarmament agreements in
particular. [Even with all the transparency measures
imaginable]{.underline} (including intrusive monitoring and verification
mechanisms), **[indeterminacy of the language delineating permissible
behavior will doom arms control to failure.]{.underline}** Such
**[indeterminacy]{.underline}** not only [robs commitments of
credibility-making it impossible to solve the security dilemma but also
i**s likely to exacerbate the security dilemma, breeding more of the
mistrust that feeds it**.]{.underline} By cloaking defection in
plausible legality, [many acts of noncompliance may be
legitimized.]{.underline} Moreover, [indeterminacy permits
discriminatory application of key rules, favoring powerful states and
deterring weaker states from joining the regime. This set of problems is
illustrated below by consideration of the indeterminate language that
has helped undermine the BWC and may have worsened the BW arms
race.]{.underline}

The word \"policy\" is not a tightly defined concept but a highly
flexible one, used in different ways on different occasions. Webster\'s
dictionary has a number of closely related definitions. They are: · A
definite course or method of action selected (by government,
institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the
light of given conditions to guide and, usually, to determine present
and future decisions. · A specific decision or set of decisions designed
to carry out such a course of action. · Such a specific decision or set
of decisions together with the related actions designed to implement
them. · A projected programme consisting of desired objectives and the
means to achieve them. In English usage, [policies are \"made\" and
\"implemented\" in the same way that decisions are made and
implemented]{.underline}. [Yet it is possible to have policies that are
not or cannot be implemented, so that, conceptually, actions that
implement policies need not necessarily be part of policy
itself]{.underline}. [Although a policy is like a decision, it is not
just a \"vie-off\", independent decision. A policy is a set of coherent
decisions with a common long-term purpose(s). When decisions are
one-off, incoherent or opportunistic, complaints are made that a

special legislation. The terms \"policy\", \"plan\", \"programme\" and
\"project\" are progressively more specific in time and place. [Policies

fair]{.underline} . 41 Thus, [the stronger party is able to **have his
way and see himself as principled** at the same time.]{.underline} 42
[Imagine]{.underline}, for example, [a man\'s]{.underline} likely
[reaction to the suggestion that subjective considerations \-- a
woman\'s mood, her sense of pressure or intimidation, how she felt about
the man, her unexpressed fear of reprisals if she did not go
ahead]{.underline} 43 \-- [ought to play a part in determining whether
the man is guilty of rape]{.underline}. [Most men find this suggestion
offensive; it requires them to do something they are not accustomed to
doing]{.underline}. \"Why,\" they say, \"I\'d have to be a mind reader
before I could have sex with anybody?\" 44 \"Who knows, anyway, what
internal inhibitions the woman might have been harboring?\" And \"what
if the woman simply changed her mind later and charged me with rape?\"
45 [What we never notice is that women can \"read\" men\'s minds
perfectly well. The male perspective is right out there in the world,
plain as day, inscribed in culture, song, and myth \-- in all the
prevailing narratives.]{.underline} 46 [These]{.underline} narratives
[tell us that men want and are entitled]{.underline} \[\*820\] [to
sex]{.underline}, [that it is a prime function of women to give it to
them,]{.underline} 47 [and that unless something unusual happens, the
act of sex is ordinary and blameless.]{.underline} 48 [We believe these
things because that is the way we have constructed women, men, and
\"normal\"]{.underline} sexual [intercourse]{.underline}. 49 [Notice
what the objective standard renders irrelevant: a downcast
look;]{.underline} 50 [ambivalence;]{.underline} 51 [the question, \"Do
you]{.underline} really [think we should?\"; slowness in following the
man\'s lead]{.underline} ; 52 [a reputation for sexual
selectivity]{.underline}; 53 [virginity; youth; and
innocence.]{.underline} 54 Indeed, [only a loud firm \"no\"
counts,]{.underline} and probably only if it is repeated several times,
overheard by others, and accompanied by forceful body language such as
pushing the man and walking away briskly. 55 [Yet society and law accept
only this latter message]{.underline} (or something like it), [and not
the former, more nuanced ones, to mean refusal. Why?]{.underline} [The
\"objective\" approach is **not inherently better or more fair**.
Rather, it is accepted because it embodies the **sense of the stronger**
party, who centuries ago found himself in a position to dictate what
permission meant.]{.underline} 56 [Allowing ourselves to be drawn into
reflexive, predictable arguments about administrability, fairness,
stability, and ease of determination points us away from
what]{.underline} \[\*821\] [really counts: the way in which stronger
parties have managed **to inscribe their views and interests into
\"external\" culture**, so that we are now enamored with that way of
judging action.]{.underline} 57 First, [we read our values and
preferences into the culture]{.underline}; 58 [then we pretend to
consult that culture meekly and humbly in order to judge our own
acts]{.underline}. 59 [A nice trick]{.underline} [if you can get away
with it.]{.underline}

#### Limits standards fail -- inherently uncontainable

**REHN & O'DOHERTY 2007**

-The more they expand the limits on the topic via the inclusion of
middle of the road and topical affirmatives, the more pressure they put
on the topic to become to become ever changing. Thus, eviscerating the
point of having the limit in the first place is good.

(Department of Industrial Management, Damian, University of Manchester
Business School, "Organization: On the Theory and Practice of Excess,"
Culture and Organization, June, pp. 99--113)

We have suggested that organization is not the other of excess, but
rather better thought as synonymous with the very production and
exacerbation of excess. Organization is excess. **[The more we push back
the limits of restrictive economy the more we amplify]{.underline}** and
stoke up the **[pressure of that excess]{.underline} '[beyond the
border']{.underline}** in a movement that invites the inevitable
'discharge' and return of the unacceptable, the dangerous, the obscene,
the disgusting. Organization at the level of the nation state always
borders a similar excess. Think of Holland and its structure of dykes
that helps man reclaim and maintain land from the sea. Consider the
haunting and perhaps founding trauma of its nation state expressed in
the image of Hans Brinker (Dodge, 2003) with his little finger plugging
a hole in the Haarlem dyke holding back the tides that threaten to sweep
away hearth and home. It is of such 'hinges'---the nuts, bolts and
washers that map the vinculum of organization---through which order and
disorder is delicately poised. Think of New Orleans and the inundation
that led to the dystopia of the Louisiana Superdome and the Convention
Centre. Each year, excess builds up: we try to bury it deeper; we
conceive plans to eject its waste into the stratosphere. Without
restricted economy its sheer excess is likely to overwhelm social
relations and undermine the possibility of community and coherence
stimulating passions and emotion that provoke contagion, panic and
hysteria. But organization is inevitably both restricted and general
economy, a theatre of cruelty that folds together these two dimensions
of organization to form local 'pools or order' (Law, 1994), both complex
and fractal in pattern. Excess does not exert its pressure in any
consistent or uniform way, marking out something like an outer
circumference of organization, but instead is better thought as as an
uneven and transient, vagrant force that migrates and mutates in often
capricious and unpredictable ways seeping into the nooks and crannies of
organization where the nuts and bolts of its heterogeneous assemblage
tremor and bear the strain of imminent collapse. 5 You might tell from
the tone in which we are compelled to write this treatise that excess is
both a fascination and a disgust. In an age of slimfast diets and
streamlined arguments it might seem surprising to claim that the notion
of excess and the excess of theory still remains insufficiently attended
to. [This paradox]{.underline} of excess [is]{.underline} particularly
[acute given the accumulation of]{.underline} academic articles, edited
collections, special editions, and online journals that seem to produce
a mindless orgy of paper and digital (reserve) ones and zeros. Excess
takes many forms; **[unpredictable and explosive]{.underline}** in its
**[manifestations]{.underline}** it always pops up just **[when we
thought we had tamed its]{.underline}** **[wild]{.underline}** and
**[protean force.]{.underline}** At the same time, as we have argued,
excess is not a form at all but more like a force or surplus energy.
Indeed once it has been 'formed', rendered in the terms of in-form-ation
for the purposes of cognition or theoretical deployment we should argue
it has been lost, condemned once more to a spectral region of
uncertainty. [It]{.underline} makes it difficult therefore to introduce
the question of excess, and indeed this special edition. We have seen
that excess [seems to fester just below the surface of what we routinely
perceive]{.underline} and understand [to be relevant]{.underline}
organizational phenomena---indeed 'excess' may be the very dragon that
the Standing Conference on Organization Symbolism takes as its logo---
an image and target for its brand of organization analysis that has
attracted little explicit attention (but see Sievers, 1990) perhaps
because safely contained behind the frame and bars of its iron cage we
are still reassured that organization can contain its monstrous
implications. In other words, we have still yet to think of excess...

### AT: Fairness

#### The idea that we should work toward fairness upholds an ideology that everyone would flourish if they all had the same chance. This ignores material and discursive oppression that holds back difference; even when starting from equal ground. This is how liberal racism thrives.

**Tapper, 12**

\[Sophie Tapper, 5/24/12,
http://www.e-ir.info/2012/05/24/critiquing-don-brashs-colour-blind-stance-on-racial-politics-in-new-zealand/,
NC\]

The second component of colour blind \[neutral\] racism, as set out by
Bonilla-Silva and Fozdar, is the way in which [political leaders
frame]{.underline} their [colour]{.underline} blind
[\[neutral\]]{.underline} stance on [racial politics in the language of
liberalism]{.underline}. In contrast to the 'de jure' white racism which
characterised countries of colonisation in the past, **[those who
propagate]{.underline}** colour blind \[neutral\] [**racism today often
extend ideas predicated on liberal values such as fairness and equality
to minorities**, but in an abstract and limited way that rationalises
unfair situations and ultimately avoids threatening white
supremacy]{.underline} (Bonilla-Silva, 2003). As Fozdar notes,
[contemporary racist and anti-racist discourses are oppositional, and
yet not categorically different: **there is a considerable overlap in
the way that apparently 'liberal' and anti-racist arguments can be
turned to racist effect**]{.underline} (Fozdar, 2008). The political
beauty of the colour blind \[neutral\] ideology, therefore, is that it
allows white elites to state overtly racial views in a seemingly
principled, even moral manner (Bonilla-Silva, 2003). **[By framing
race-related issues in the language of liberalism, politicians can be
seen to uphold equality, fairness and meritocracy while at the same
denying the existence of systematic and institutionalised
discrimination, consequently disregarding the implications of existing
racial inequality and opposing all practical approaches to dealing with
'de facto' racial inequality]{.underline}** (Bonilla-Silva, 2003).
Bonilla-Silva calls colour blind \[neutral\]ness a "formidable racial
ideology" because in spite of the fact that its purpose is to preserve
existing power imbalances between the white majority and non-white
minority, "at worst, it seems like racism 'lite'" (Bonilla-Silva, 2003,
p. 79).

Brash drew upon liberal values throughout his speech to the Orewa Rotary
Club, illustrating the way in which political leaders who subscribe to
the colour blind \[neutral\] ideology make use of this rhetorical
device. At the beginning of his address, Brash proclaimed that "we are a
country of many peoples, not simply a society of Māori and Pākehā where
the minority has the birthright to the upper hand" (Brash, 2004).
Equality remained a common theme throughout, often used in conjunction
with democracy, modernity and prosperity. Brash assured his listeners
that "in this country it should not matter what colour you are ... we
must build a modern, prosperous, democratic nation based upon one rule
for all", deployed the actions of the local authorities "introducing
Māori wards without regard to whether the guiding democratic principle
of 'one person, one vote' is violated" and declared that New Zealand
must "build a prosperous nation of one people, living under one set of
laws" (Brash, 2004). In a later television interview, Brash attempted to
silence criticism that he was manipulating race-related issues in order
to gain popularity by accentuating the fair, just and reasonable nature
of his position on racial politics: "The reality is that I'm playing the
reverse of a race card. I'm saying that all races should be treated
equally and fairly" (Bradford, 2004).

By making specific reference to equality in particular, Brash cunningly
played to the egalitarianism characteristic of New Zealand's political
culture. As Jon Johansson highlights, the charge that any group is
receiving some sort of privilege at the expense of other New Zealanders
is bound to find a receptive audience (Johanssan, 2004). Furthermore,
Brash deliberately presented himself as an honest and forthright person
for whom race-related issues are painful to discuss: he began his speech
by asserting, "I believe in plain speaking. So let me be blunt", and
ended with "I am deeply saddened to make a speech on issues about race"
(Brash, 2004). As a result, Brash was able to cultivate the powerful
image of a political leader with integrity, which reinforced the
seemingly principled nature of his views (Johanssan, 2004).

According to analysts of colour blind \[neutral\] racism, however, it is
"one thing to keep in step with the latest anti-racist language, another
to pledge action against the huge institutional injustices" (Turner,
2007). [While the language associated with colour blind \[neutral\]
racism may appear liberal or progressive, this disguises its
conservative end]{.underline} (Fozdar, 2008). A former Governor of the
Reserve Bank, [Brash's approach to achieving racial equality draws upon
the ideological values of neoliberalism]{.underline}, and accordingly he
**[makes the assumption that equal rights are readily available to any
entrepreneurial and self-interested individual who desires to improve
their position]{.underline}** (Tuhiwai-Smith, 2007). Consequently, Brash
perceives affirmative action measures which 'privilege' one individual
over another on the basis of racial identity as unfair, and detrimental
to reducing racial disparities because they give the minority the 'upper
hand'. This argument disregards the fact that the fundamental aim of
affirmative action policies is to address historical and persistent
underprivilege, and create the 'level playing field' which failed to
exist in the first place (Fox, 2010). As President Lyndon Johnson, who
introduced affirmative action to the United States, explained: "you do
not take a person who for years has been hobbled with chains and
liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and say
'you're free to compete with all the others'" (Watkin, 2004). In the
same way, Brash's seemingly liberal view that Māori and Pākehā should be
given equal rights regardless of race omits to recognise that we are not
yet an equal society (Fox, 2010). [His neoliberal assumption that
equality is 'universally' available to those who work hard disregards
the fact that historical racial injustices have given the white majority
a considerable 'head start', illustrating the white supremacist mode of
thought which pervades his colour]{.underline} blind \[[neutral\]
approach to achieving racial equality.]{.underline} [In
reality]{.underline}, as Māori academic Evan Poata-Smith and former
Māori Language Commissioner Paul Hohepa contend, **[treating minority
races who are clearly unequal as equal does not combat racism but rather
perpetuates inequality while maintaining the ideological pretence of
fairness]{.underline}** (Poata-Smith, 2004; Watkin, 2004).

#### Debate is not neutral

**Stannard 2000 **

\[Matt, director of forensics and associate lecturer in the University
of Wyoming Department of Communication and Journalism, "Portraying the
Ruling Class: Argument Fields and the Material Antecedents of Policy
Debate, "<http://www.uvm.edu/~debate/stannard300a.html>\]

Moreover, [reliance on mass media sources, the journals of elitist think
tanks, and public relations-manufactured press services all serve to
construct a particular possibility of argument in policy
debates]{.underline}. The advent of electronic research databases has
exacerbated this conservatizing tendency since most of these databases
are mainstream in content.

To summarize, [I am suggesting that discursive inequalities and
marginalized identities are not the only objects of criticism in policy
debate]{.underline}. [These problems are symptoms of the reproduction
of the policy field, a field which, in its institutionalized
materiality, produces and contains both inequality and
marginalization]{.underline}. The field of policy debate is a ritualized
and enhanced reproduction of this larger material institution. [Debaters
are taught, through pedagogy and reward, drawing from policy literature
and traditional(uncritical) notions of governing, to imitate the ruling
class. Inequality and marginalization are part of the structure
governing such imitation.]{.underline}

### AT: Switch Side

#### White fluidity da -- the belief in a false divide between neg and aff positions demands static dichotomies while they embody their view from nowhere

**Yancy 5** \[George, associate professor of philosophy at Duquesne
University, "Whiteness and the Return of the Black Body," The Journal of
Speculative Philosophy, 19.4\]

[I write out of a personal existential context. This context is a
profound source of knowledge connected to my \"raced\"
body.]{.underline} Hence, [I write from a place of lived embodied
experience, a site of exposure. In philosophy, the only thing that we
are taught to \"expose\" is a weak argument, a fallacy, or someone\'s
\"inferior\" reasoning power.]{.underline} [The embodied self is
bracketed and deemed irrelevant to theory, superfluous and
cumbersome]{.underline} in one\'s search for truth. [It is
best]{.underline}, or so we are told, [to reason from nowhere. Hence,
the white philosopher/author presumes to speak for all of \"us\" without
the slightest mention of his or her \"raced\" identity]{.underline}.
Self-consciously writing as a white male philosopher, Crispin [Sartwell
observes]{.underline}: [Left to my own devices, I disappear as an
author]{.underline}. That is [the \"whiteness\" of my authorship. This
whiteness of authorship is,]{.underline} for us, [a form of authority;
to speak]{.underline} (apparently) [from nowhere, for everyone, is
empowering]{.underline}, though one wields power here only by becoming
lost to oneself. But [such an authorship and authority is also
pleasurable: it yields the pleasure of self-forgetting or]{.underline}
[apparent]{.underline} [transcendence of the mundane and the particular,
and the pleasure of power expressed in the \"comprehension\" of a range
of materials.]{.underline}

### AT: RolePlay/Simulation

**USFG simulation disavows debaters from personal responsibility,
killing any hope for real world participation, and excludes ulterior
forms of knowledge production -- this causes oppression and turns
education.**

**Dr. Reid-Brinkley 8** (Shanara Reid-Brinkley, Rhetoric PhD & Prof @
Pitt, and the most competitively successful black woman in CEDA history,
THE HARSH REALITIES OF "ACTING BLACK": HOW AFRICAN-AMERICAN POLICY
DEBATERS NEGOTIATE REPRESENTATION THROUGH RACIAL PERFORMANCE AND STYLE)

[Mitchell observes that the stance of the policymaker in debate comes
with a "sense of detachment associated with the spectator
posture]{.underline}."115 In other words, [its participants are able to
engage in debates where they are able to distance themselves from the
events that are the subjects of debates. Debaters can throw around terms
like]{.underline} torture, terrorism, [genocide and nuclear war without
blinking. Debate simulations can **only serve to distance the debaters
from real world participation in the political contexts they debate
about**.]{.underline} As William [Shanahan remarks: ...the topic
established a relationship through interpellation that inhered
irrespective of what the particular political affinities of the debaters
were.]{.underline} The relationship was both political and ethical, and
needed to be debated as such. [When we blithely call for United States
Federal Government policymaking, we are not immune to the colonialist
legacy that establishes our place on this continent. We cannot wish away
the horrific atrocities perpetrated everyday in our name simply by
**refusing to acknowledge these implications**"]{.underline} (emphasis
in original).116 [The "objective" stance of the policymaker is an
impersonal or imperialist persona. The policymaker relies upon
"acceptable" forms of evidence, engaging in logical discussion,
producing rational thoughts]{.underline}. As Shanahan, and the
Louisville debaters' note, [such a stance is integrally linked to the
normative, historical and contemporary practices of power that produce
and maintain varying networks of oppression.]{.underline} In other
words, [the discursive practices of policy-oriented debate are developed
within, through and from systems of power and privilege. Thus, these
practices are critically implicated in the maintenance of
hegemony.]{.underline} So, rather than seeing themselves as government
or state actors, Jones and Green choose to perform themselves in debate,
violating the more "objective" stance of the "policymaker" and require
their opponents to do the same.

### AT: Dialogue

#### Debate is a zero sum game that forecloses the possibility of dialogue. 

**Anderson 98** (Albert A., Professor of Philosophy, Babson College,
"Why Dialogue?",
http://www.wordtrade.com/philosophy/ancient/whydialogue.htm)

[Dialogue is not debate. Debate differs from discussion in that the
verbal exchange usually has a limited number of positions stipulated at
the outset (such as affirmative vs. negative]{.underline}, liberal vs.
conservative, or plaintiff vs. defendant[), each competing with the
others with the clear goal of winning the contest. Debate is a zero‑sum
game]{.underline}. If one side wins, the other side must lose**.** [The
goal in a debate is to win the verbal contest by persuading
others,]{.underline} often without concern for the truth of the matter.
[It differs from discussion in its single‑minded purpose of proving a
pre‑established position in order to win; to change positions in a
debate is to lose the contest]{.underline}. The adversarial method
frequently employed by lawyers is one familiar form of debate. Although
it is not necessary for the legal process to employ this method, when
money and power are at stake it is not surprising that a win/lose
strategy takes over.

The most important difference between dialogue and these other forms of
oral exchange is its primary dedication to what is common or universal.
Conversation often depends on the tastes and inclinations of the
participants without an agenda or clear objective. Discussion and
debate, by contrast, are dedicated to presenting and defending a
specific position or point of view, usually determined by the context or
the group being represented. [Unlike these other forms of verbal
activity, dialogue makes no prior judgment about the outcome of the
process]{.underline}**.** It is serious inquiry that seeks to understand
the nature and activity of whatever subject matter is being considered.
**[It]{.underline}** [searches for truth rather than taking it as given
at the outset of the inquiry. Participants in a dialogue are free to
change their mind in the course of the exchange]{.underline}**.**

### AT: Agoinism Impacts

#### we have to foreground a critique of social conditions that deliberation is constructed on to activate political agency

-Democracy relies on social conditions. Overemphasizing autonomy
reflects a misunderstanding of our actual political agency. The context
from where we get our personal freedom must come first to actual
political action.

**Edwards 13**

(Jason Edwards, Lecturer in Politics, Programme Director BA Politics and
Government at Birbeck University of London, 2013, "Play and Democracy:
Huizinga and the Limits of Agonism," Political Theory 41(1) 90--115,
DOI: 10.1177/0090591712463200)

The idea that democracy is played as a form of life implies that what is
expressed through the agon is the normative grounds of democratic life.
It is in this sense that playing the democratic game requires the
acceptance of a shared ethos or attitude that has no ultimate rationale
or justification. An agonistic polity must be constituted by more than
the formal representation of the political unity of citizens through the
constitution, the emblems of political identity such as the flag, the
national anthem, etc. Its unity is given through its modes of
contestation, but in turn these are the inherited forms of life peculiar
to a given political community. The persistence of that community over
time is reliant upon a certain degree of stability and predictability of
those forms. [Thus the problem of the distinction between the form and
substance of play that appears in the work of both Huizinga and
contemporary agonists draws our attention towards the fact that in
general games of democratic political contestation are no more or no
less autonomous than other kinds of games. **The playing of the
democratic game is dependent on more than its formal or abstract rules,
and relies on particular social and material conditions for its
performance.**]{.underline} Hence a third problem posed by the concept
of play to contemporary agonism is how it can account for and address
the social relations and material conditions that constitute the agon.
Indeed, can it provide such an account if [the tendency to
**overemphasize**]{.underline} the **[autonomy]{.underline}** of
language and culture **[leads to a failure to recognize the centrality
of the wider economy]{.underline}** of agonism in the constitution of
agonistic democratic contest? This is not an insurmountable problem if
what we have here is a simple matter of overemphasis, for it would seem
regressive and crude to dismiss the idea that democratic language and
culture have their own specific effects on the character of democratic
political action. Yet those with a critical perspective on the agonistic
turn in political theory have provided reasons for thinking that [the
neglect of matters of the social and material constitution of agonistic
relations **rests on a misunderstanding of the very nature of political
agency.**]{.underline} On this view, as Lois McNay claims, [political
agency is construed]{.underline} in certain strains of agonistic thought
[in abstract]{.underline} and discursive [terms]{.underline}, rather
than as a "capacity of embodied subjects," and **[there is a failure to
recognise "the social conditions necessary for the emergence of
effective political agency."]{.underline}** 15 In this sense, and as a
reading of Huizinga's works helps to establish, [the context and
materials of play **cannot be divorced from play itself**: to do so
would be to idealize the form of play and to **draw our attention away
from the social relations and material practices** that give shape to
the conduct of the contesting actors in democratic games.]{.underline}
Huizinga and contemporary agonists share in common a dismissal of a
crude socioeconomic reductionism characteristic of particular kinds of
Marxist thought. However, as I will argue, in their work the pendulum
swings too far the other way and [we lose sight of the necessary
embeddedness of play---and culture---in social relations and material
practices.]{.underline}.

### Elitism DA

#### Elitism DA -- Policy engagement is a game for white people, the decisions that we make us unable to sufficiently deal with social justice issues -- its just an activity of the elites.

Iris Marion **Young**, Oct 20**11** (Political Theory, Vol. 29, No. 5
(Oct., 2001), pp. 670-690, "Activist Challenges to Deliberative
Democracy", JSTOR :)

[Exhorting citizens to engage in respectful argument with others they
dis- agree with is a fine recommendation]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
[the ideal world]{.underline} that the deliberative democrat theorizes,
says the activist, where everyone is included and the political equal of
one another. [This is not the real world of politics]{.underline},
[however, where powerful elites representing structurally dominant
social segments]{.underline} [have significant influence over political
processes and decisions]{.underline}. Deliberation sometimes occurs in
this real world. [Officials]{.underline} and dignitaries [meet all the
time to hammer out agreements]{.underline}. [Their meetings are usually
well organized with structured procedures]{.underline}, and those [who
know the rules are]{.underline} often [able to further their
objectives]{.underline} [through]{.underline} them by [presenting
proposals]{.underline} and giv- ing reasons for them, [which are
considered and critically evaluated by the others]{.underline}, who give
their own reasons. Deliberation, the activist says, is an activ- ity of
boardrooms and congressional committees and sometimes even parlia-
ments. [Elites exert their power partly through managing deliberative
settings]{.underline}. [Among themselves they engage in debate about the
policies that will sustain their power]{.underline} [and further their
collective interests]{.underline}. [Entrance into such delibera- tive
settings is usually rather tightly controlled]{.underline}, [and the
interests of many affected by the decisions made in them often receive
no voice or representa- tion]{.underline}. [The proceedings of these
meetings, moreover, are often not open to gen- eral observation, and
often they leave no public record]{.underline}. [Observers and mem- bers
of the press come only by invitation]{.underline}. [Deliberation is
primarily an activity of political elites]{.underline} who treat one
another with cordial respect and try to work out their differences.
Insofar as deliberation is exclusive in this way, and inso- far as the
decisions reached in such deliberative bodies support and perpetu- ate
structural inequality or otherwise have unjust and harmful consequences,
says the activist, then it is wrong to prescribe deliberation for good
citizens committed to furthering social justice. Under these
circumstances of struc- tural inequality and exclusive power, good
citizens should be protesting out- side these meetings, calling public
attention to the assumptions made in them, the control exercised, and
the resulting limitations or wrongs of their outcomes. They should use
the power of shame and exposure to pressure deliberators to widen their
agenda and include attention to more interests. As long as the
proceedings exercise exclusive power for the sake of the interests of
elites and against the interests of most citizens, then politically
engaged citizens who care about justice and environmental preservation
are justified even in taking actions aimed at preventing or disrupting
the deliberations.
