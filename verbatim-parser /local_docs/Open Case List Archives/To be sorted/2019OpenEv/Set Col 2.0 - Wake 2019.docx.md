### Vs Policy Affs

#### Settler colonialism is a structure, erasing indigenous peoples and making savage their relationship with the environment causing constant and profound violence.

Our intention in this descriptive exercise is not be exhaustive, or even
inarguable; instead, we wish to emphasize that (a) decolonization will
take a different shape in each of these contexts - though they can
overlap - and that (b) neither external nor internal colonialism
adequately describe the form of colonialism which operates in the United
States or other nation-states in which the colonizer comes to stay.
[Settler colonialism operates through internal/external colonial modes
simultaneously because there is no spatial separation between metropole
and colony.]{.underline} For example, [in the United States, many
Indigenous peoples have been forcibly removed from their homelands onto
reservations, indentured, and abducted into state custody, signaling the
form of colonization as simultaneously internal (via boarding schools
and other biopolitical modes of control) and external (via uranium
mining on Indigenous land in the US Southwest and oil extraction on
Indigenous land in Alaska) with a frontier (the US military still
nicknames all enemy territory "Indian Country").]{.underline} **[[The
horizons of the settler colonial nation-state]{.mark}]{.underline}** are
total and **[[require]{.mark}]{.underline}** a mode of **[[total
appropriation of Indigenous life and land]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather
than the selective expropriation of profit-producing fragments. [Settler
colonialism is different from other forms of colonialism]{.underline} in
that [settlers come with the intention of making a new home on the
land,]{.underline} a homemaking [[that insists on settler sovereignty
over all things]{.underline}]{.mark} in their new domain. Thus,
**[relying]{.underline}** solely **[on postcolonial literatures
or]{.underline}** theories of **[coloniality that ignore settler
colonialism will not help to envision the shape that decolonization must
take in settler colonial contexts]{.underline}**. Within settler
colonialism, the most important concern is land/water/air/subterranean
earth (land, for shorthand, in this article.) [Land is what is most
valuable, contested, required]{.underline}. [This is both because the
[settlers make ]{.mark}]{.underline}Indigenous [[land
their]{.mark}]{.underline} new home and [[source of
capital,]{.mark}]{.underline} and also because [[the disruption of
Indigenous relationships to land represents]{.mark}]{.underline} a
profound [**[epistemic, ontological, cosmological
violence]{.underline}**. [This violence is not temporally
contained]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the arrival of the settler [but is
reasserted each day of occupation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is why
Patrick Wolfe (1999) emphasizes that **[[settler colonialism is a
structure and not an event]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the process of
settler colonialism, [land is remade into property and human
relationships to land are restricted to the relationship of the owner to
his property]{.underline}. Epistemological, ontological, and
cosmological relationships to land are interred, indeed made pre-modern
and backward. Made savage. [In order for the settlers to make a place
their home, they must destroy and disappear the Indigenous peoples that
live there.]{.underline} Indigenous peoples are those who have creation
stories, not colonization stories, about how we/they came to be in a
particular place - indeed how we/they came to be a place. [Our/their
relationships to land comprise our/their epistemologies, ontologies, and
cosmologies.]{.underline} For the settlers, Indigenous peoples are in
the way and, in the destruction of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous
communities, and over time and through law and policy, Indigenous
peoples' claims to land under settler regimes, land is recast as
property and as a resource. **[Indigenous peoples must be erased, must
be made into ghosts]{.underline}** (Tuck and Ree, forthcoming). At the
same time, [settler colonialism [involves the subjugation and forced
labor of chattel slaves, whose bodies and lives become the property, and
who are kept landless]{.mark}.]{.underline} Slavery in settler colonial
contexts is distinct from other forms of indenture whereby excess labor
is extracted from persons. First, [chattels are commodities of labor and
therefore it is [the slave's person that is the
excess]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second, unlike workers who may aspire to
own land, the slave's very presence on the land is already an excess
that must be dis-located. Thus, [the slave is a desirable commodity but
the person underneath is imprisonable, punishable, and murderable. [The
violence of keeping/killing the chattel slave makes them deathlike
monsters in the settler imagination]{.mark}]{.underline}; they are
reconfigured/disfigured as the threat, the razor's edge of safety and
terror. The settler, if known by his actions and how he justifies them,
sees himself as holding dominion over the earth and its flora and fauna,
as the anthropocentric normal, and as more developed, more human, more
deserving than other groups or species. The settler is making a new
\"home\" and that home is rooted in a homesteading worldview where the
wild land and wild people were made for his benefit. He can only make
his identity as a settler by making the land produce, and produce
excessively, because \"civilization\" is defined as production in excess
of the \"natural\" world (i.e. in excess of the sustainable production
already present in the Indigenous world). In order for excess
production, he needs excess labor, which he cannot provide himself.
[[The chattel slave serves as that excess labor, labor that can never be
paid because payment would have to be in the form of property
(land]{.mark}).]{.underline} The settler\'s wealth is land, or a
fungible version of it, and so payment for labor is impossible.6 The
settler positions himself as both superior and normal; the settler is
natural, whereas the Indigenous inhabitant and the chattel slave are
unnatural, even supernatural. [Settlers are not immigrants.]{.underline}
Immigrants are beholden to the Indigenous laws and epistemologies of the
lands they migrate to. Settlers become the law, supplanting Indigenous
laws and epistemologies. Therefore, settler nations are not immigrant
nations (See also A.J. Barker, 2009). Not unique, the United States, as
a settler colonial nation-state, also operates as an empire - utilizing
external forms and internal forms of colonization simultaneous to the
settler colonial project[.]{.underline} This means, and this is
perplexing to some, that dispossessed people are brought onto seized
Indigenous land through other colonial projects. Other colonial projects
include enslavement, as discussed, but also military recruitment,
low-wage and high-wage labor recruitment (such as agricultural workers
and overseas-trained engineers), and displacement/migration (such as the
coerced immigration from nations torn by U.S. wars or devastated by U.S.
economic policy). [In this set of settler colonial relations, colonial
subjects who are displaced by external colonialism, as well as
racialized and minoritized by internal colonialism, still occupy and
settle stolen Indigenous land. [Settlers are diverse, not just
]{.mark}]{.underline}of [[white]{.mark} European descent, and include
people of color]{.underline}, even from other colonial contexts. [This
tightly wound set of conditions and racialized, globalized relations
exponentially complicates what is meant by decolonization, and by
solidarity, against settler colonial forces.]{.underline} Decolonization
in exploitative colonial situations could involve the seizing of
imperial wealth by the postcolonial subject. In settler colonial
situations, seizing imperial wealth is inextricably tied to settlement
and re-invasion. Likewise, the promise of integration and civil rights
is predicated on securing a share of a settler-appropriated wealth (as
well as expropriated 'third-world' wealth). Decolonization in a settler
context is fraught because empire, settlement, and internal colony have
no spatial separation. Each of these features of settler colonialism in
the US context - empire, settlement, and internal colony - make it a
site of contradictory decolonial desires7. **[[Decolonization as
metaphor allows people to equivocate]{.mark}]{.underline}** these
**[[contradictory decolonial desires because it turns decolonization
into an empty signifier to be filled by any track towards
liberation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In reality, [the tracks walk all over
land/people in settler contexts.]{.underline} Though the details are not
fixed or agreed upon, in our view, [[decolonization]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the settler colonial context [[must involve the repatriation of
land]{.mark} simultaneous to the recognition of how land and relations
to land have always already been differently understood and enacted;
that is, all of the land, and not just symbolically.]{.underline} [This
is precisely why decolonization is]{.underline} necessarily [unsettling,
especially across lines of solidarity]{.underline}. "Decolonization
never takes place unnoticed" (Fanon, 1963, p. 36). **[Settler
colonialism and its decolonization implicates and unsettles
everyone.]{.underline}**

#### The pursuit of total security and US interventionism is predicated on the dual schema of settler futurity and racialized violence that stems from settler colonialism

[[The U.S. settler state internalizes a "righteous violence" predicated
on a]{.mark}n expanding "[quest for total security"]{.mark} that has
come to characterize domestic and foreign policy]{.underline} (Hixson
2013, 198). Although there are myriad ways to explore the interrelations
between state-sanctioned violence and militarism, we find the
connections between domestic policing and the U.S. military-industrial
complex to be particularly illustrative. Kraska and Cubellis (1997)
noted that [[there is a long history of collusion between]{.mark} the
[military and police departments]{.mark} in the United States and [the
military paradigm]{.mark} [is an important organizing principle
within]{.mark} the development of [modern policing]{.mark} practices,
organization, and tactics]{.underline} (e.g., Bittner 1970; Manning
1977; Enloe 1980; A. Hall and Coyne 2012). [These practices took on
added significance during the latter half of the twentieth century as
U.S. cities faced increased pressure to "get tough on crime" and as
local police departments developed]{.underline} specially trained
tactical teams, commonly referred to as Special Weapons and Tactics
([SWAT) teams]{.underline} (Kraska and Cubellis 1997). [The interactions
between the military and domestic police practices intensified yet again
during the "war on drugs" and in a post--11 September 2001 world where
domestic terror concerns have fueled the explosive growth of military
and police cooperation]{.underline} (A. Hall and Coyne 2012). Although
ostensibly unconnected to questions of race and economic inequality[,
[militarism is]{.mark} fundamentally [linked to structural violences of
poverty and social difference]{.mark}]{.underline} (Loyd 2009, 2014),
[and [the pursuit of total security connects settler state militarism
across scales, legitimating the expansion and protection of the
nation-state]{.mark}, the policing of its borders and communities, and
internal and external monitoring and surveillance in the name of
defense. [Securing the white supremacist settler state relies on]{.mark}
racial, gender, and class [hierarchies that enable the coherence of an
imagined nation with]{.mark} clearly [marked inclusions and
exclusions]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is, [[the]{.mark} targeted and
widespread [violence that]{.mark} [characterizes the U.S. settler
state]{.mark}---seen in everything from the genocide directed toward
Native peoples to the criminalization of communities of color---[depends
on]{.mark} and reinforces discursive [constructions that demonize those
who stand in the way of the settler state]{.mark} and, more often than
not, culminates in national campaigns against those beyond the scope of
U.S. settler state justice.]{.underline} [The indiscriminate killing
associated with this kind of violence is easily dismissed as an
unfortunate consequence of war]{.underline} (Hixson 2013). [[U.S.
interventionism relies on]{.mark} a "[defensive solidarity \... built
on]{.mark} the institution of [slavery and]{.mark} the
[racialization]{.mark} of Blackness" [that reaffirms white supremacist
cultural identity]{.mark} by managing both internal and external
threats]{.underline} (Loyd 2009, 406). [These practices continue even
after the settler state has displaced and "removed" native peoples who
had previously occupied the land, creating political landscapes with an
aggressive propensity for violence]{.underline} (Veracini 2010). This
understanding of the United States as a settler state is significant for
theorizing militarism, we argue, because it situates the persistent
violences of genocide and slavery as enduring structures shaping social
and political economic relations. Rather than being projects of the
past, [[settler practices are central to]{.mark} the continued
development and [futurity]{.mark} of the United States. [A settler
colonial perspective disrupts the spatial imaginaries of war]{.mark} by
emphasizing the ongoing racialized violence necessary to secure
contested, although taken for granted, homelands in settler
nations.]{.underline} Moreover, [[it connects the indiscriminate
violence stretching from U.S. settler colonial history to contemporary
military engagement]{.mark}s]{.underline} (Hixson 2013). [As Blackhawk
and Apache helicopters swoop and attack and Tomahawk cruise missiles
explode, and as U.S. Special Forces head into "Indian country" to search
and destroy the enemy, the ramifications and taken for granted
sensibilities of settler geographies become all too clear]{.underline}
(Hixson 2013, 198). Hixson (2013) further clarified, "[A[merican settler
colonialism is a]{.mark} winnertakes-all [proposition that demanded the
removal of indigenous peoples]{.mark} and the destruction of their
cultures," and these geographies have "profound consequences for
national identity and subsequent foreign policy"]{.underline} (197[).
[The settler state is premised on permanent war,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[inscribing militarism and violence into everyday geographies and
naturalizing racialized power hierarchies]{.mark} and the dispossession
and erasure of racialized bodies.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's spectacle of US violence deployed abroad is a symptom of "Free Tibet Syndrome"---the decrying of injustice elsewhere to uphold colonialism at home

**Barker 10** \[Adam, "From Adversaries to Allies: Forging Respectful
Alliances between Indigenous and Settler Peoples," *Alliances:
Re/Envisioning Indigenous-non-Indigenous Relationships*, ed. Lynne
Davis, 2010, p. 322-323\]

The second response is [what Corntassel]{.underline} (2006: 36) [has
called [the 'Free Tibet syndrome]{.mark}.']{.underline} In this
instance, [[colonial Settlers engage with injustices, but only with
those]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[perpetrated somewhere else]{.mark},
by someone else. [This allows the release of pent-up guilt
over]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}opulent and [[privileged
lifestyles]{.mark} through the contribution to 'some good end,' [without
actual]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}personal
[[sacrifice]{.underline}]{.mark} or discomfort. Further, [[involvement
in such causes is often token]{.underline}]{.mark} --- small donations,
a bumper-sticker, standing at a rally out- side of an embassy or
legislative building, when convenient." It is [as if the pain that
results from colonialism is commodified; [the pain]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}that results [[from being colonized and the
pain]{.underline}]{.mark} that results [[from realizing that one is a
colonizer are supposed to disappear]{.underline}]{.mark} because of
donations that may or may not ever actually affect anyone's life.
Meanwhile, practical [[actions that could be taken in the
immediate]{.underline}]{.mark} social and political [context [of the
colonial Settler's own life and location are
ignored]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In order to ask the question
honestly, [[Settler]{.mark} people [must come to understand that
colonization is motivated by an implicit
individualism]{.mark}]{.underline}, functionally similar to selfishness:
colonial Settler actions, even when not intended as such, can appear as
greed for power and privilege, insulation from conflict or fear, and
[the freedom to]{.underline} completely [ignore problematic 'others' as
well as the effects of individual actions]{.underline}.12
[[Decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}, on any scale, [[cannot be
motivated by an effort to maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} as much
[[comfort]{.underline}]{.mark} or privilege as possible; given the
nature of hierarchical oppression, [[confronting oppression requires
that some individuals within the hierarchy will have to
make]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [[sacrifices]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Alfred (2005) highlights the need for means-ends consistency in
Indigenous peoples\' struggles for freedom: a violent revolution will
lead to a violent society, an economic development solution to a
competitive, capitalist society, and so on (52). [For Settler peoples,
a]{.underline} personal [revolution based in
self-preservation]{.underline} above all else [will result in a selfish
life]{.underline}. To ensure that this does not happen, [[Settler
people]{.underline}]{.mark} who hope to become effective allies
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} move past the desire to re-establish comfort
and [[ask the question, 'What do we do?' from a profoundly uncomfortable
place]{.underline}]{.mark}. This place of profound discomfort, generated
by an honest inquiry into the causes and effects of colonialism, and our
individual responsibility for colonization, is what Regan (2006) has
referred to as 'unsettling the Settler within.'

#### The aff is part of the liberal ethos which disavows the ontological prior in achieving freedom- this erases indigeneity 

**Byrd 11**

(Jodi A., Associate Professor of English and American Indian Studies at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, *The Transit of Empire:
Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism*, 2011, p. xxiv-xxv DH)

As civil rights, queer rights, and other rights struggles have often
cathected liberal democracy as the best possible avenue to redress the
historical violences of and exclusions from the state, scholars and
activists committed to social justice have been left with impossible
choices: to articulate freedom at the expense of another, to seek power
and recognition in the hopes that we might avoid the syllogisms of
democracy created through colonialism. Lisa Lowe provides a useful
caution as she reminds us that "[[the affirmation
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the desire for [[freedom is]{.underline}]{.mark}
so [[inhabited by the forgetting of its condition of
possibility]{.underline}]{.mark} that every narrative articulation of
freedom is haunted by its burial, by the violence of forgetting." [[The
ethical moment before us is to comprehend]{.underline}]{.mark} "the
particular loss of the intimacies of four continents, [to engage
[slavery, genocide]{.mark}, indenture, [and liberalism as a
conjunction]{.mark}, as an actively acknowledged loss within the
present]{.underline}."19 In attempting to people the intimacies of four
continents, Lowe activates the Chinese indentured laborer in the
Caribbean just after Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807 as the
affective entry point into "a range of connections, the global
intimacies out of which emerged not only modern humanism but a modern
racialized division of labor."20 Her turn to the colonial racialized
labor force in the Americas helps to reveal the degree to which
intimacy---here tracked through the spheres of spatial proximity,
privacy, and volatility---among Africa, Asia, and Europe in the Americas
has served as the forgotten and disavowed constitutive means through
which liberal humanism defines freedom, family, equality, and humanity.
In fact, [[liberal humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Lowe,
[[depends upon the]{.mark} "'[economy of affirmation and
forgetting]{.mark}'" [not just of]{.mark}]{.underline} particular
[[streams of]{.mark} human [history, but of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
loss of their [[geographies, histories, and
subjectivities]{.underline}]{.mark}.21 In the indeterminacies between
and among freedom, enslavement, indentureship, interior, and exterior,
the recovered Asian contract laborer, functioning as historical site for
Lowe, can reveal the processes through which liberalism asserts freedom
and forgets enslavement as the condition of possibility for what
constitutes "the human." "Freedom was" Lowe stresses, "constituted
through a narrative dialectic that rested simultaneously on a
spatialization of the unfree as exteriority and a temporal subsuming of
enslavement as internal difference or contradiction. The 'overcoming' of
internal contradiction resolves in freedom within the modern Western
political sphere through displacement and elision of the coeval
conditions of slavery and indentureship in the Americas."22 But [[what
seems]{.underline}]{.mark} to me to be further
[[disavowed]{.underline}]{.mark}, even in Lowe\'s important figuration
of the history of labor in "the intimacies of four continents"
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}
that such labor underwrites. [[Asia, Africa, and
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[meet in the Americas to labor
over]{.mark} the dialectics of [free and unfree, but what of the
Americas themselves and the prior peoples upon whom that labor took
place?]{.mark}]{.underline} Lowe includes "native peoples" in her
figurations as an addendum when she writes that she hopes "to evoke the
political economic logics through which men and women from Africa and
Asia were forcibly transported to the Americas, who with native, mixed,
and creole peoples constituted slave societies, the profits of which
gave rise to bourgeois republican states in Europe and North America."23
By positioning the conditions of slavery and indentureship in the
Americas as coeval contradictions through which Western freedom affirms
and resolves itself, and then by collapsing the indigenous Americas into
slavery, [[the fourth continent of settler colonialism]{.mark}
through]{.underline} which [such intimacy is made to labor is not just
forgotten or elided]{.underline}; [it [becomes the very ground through
which the other]{.mark} three continents [struggle]{.mark} intimately
for freedom, justice, and equality]{.underline}. Within Lowe\'s
formulation, the native peoples of the Americas are collapsed into
slavery; their only role within the disavowed intimacies of
racialization is either one equivalent to that of African slaves or
their ability to die so imported labor can make use of their lands,
"thus, within the "intimacies of four continents," [[indigenous peoples
in the new world cannot, in this system, give rise to any historical
agency or status]{.mark} within the "economy of affirmation and
forgetting," [because they are the transit through which the dialectic
of subject and object occurs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Fear of extinction is a fabricated settler paradox that settler
colonialism uses to for settler futurity -- this relieves the settler of
guilt and gives value to settler life at the cost of genocide**

[**[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}**;]{.mark} [to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come.]{.underline} This
tendency is widely prevalent in English-language representations of
settler colonialism produced since the 1980s: [the possibility of an
ending -- the likelihood that the settler race will one day die out --
is a common theme]{.underline} in literary and pop culture
considerations of colonialism's future. Yet it has barely been remarked
how surprising it is that this theme is so present. [For settlers, of
all people, to obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is
counterintuitive, for few modern social for- mations have been more
resistant to change than settler colonialism]{.underline}. With a few
excep- tions (French Algeria being the largest), the settler societies
established in the last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and
Southern Africa have all retained the basic features that define them as
settler states -- namely, the structural privileging of settlers at the
expense of indigenous peoples, and the normalization of whiteness as the
marker of pol- itical agency and rights -- and they have done so
notwithstanding the sustained resistance¶ that has been mounted whenever
such an order has been built[. [Settlers think all the time that they
might one day end, even though]{.mark}]{.underline} (perhaps because)
[[that ending seems unlikely ever to happen.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
significance of this paradox for settler-colonial literature is the
subject of this article.¶ [Considering the problem of futurity offers a
useful foil to traditional analyses of settler- colonial narrative,
which typically examine settlers' attitudes towards history in order to
highlight a constitutive anxiety about the past -- about
origins.]{.underline} Settler colonialism, the argument goes, has a
problem with historical narration that arises from a contradiction in
its founding mythology. In Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler
subject is by definition one who comes from elsewhere but who strives to
make this place home. The settlement narrative must explain how this gap
-- which is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has
been bridged, and the settler transformed from outsider into indigene.
Yet the transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because
the desire to be at home necessarily invokes the spectre of the native,
whose existence (which cannot be disavowed completely because it is
needed to define the settler's difference, superior- ity, and hence
claim to the land) inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating
the gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to
efface.1 [Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around its need to
erase and evoke the native,]{.underline} to make the indigene both
invisible and present in a contradictory pattern that prevents settlers
from ever moving on from the moment of colonization.2 [As evidence of
this constitutive contradiction, critics have identified in
settler-colonial discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as
disavowal, inversion, and repression.]{.underline}3 Indeed, [the frozen
temporality of settler-colonial narrative, fixated on the moment of the
frontier, recalls nothing so much as Freud's description of the
'repetition compulsion' attending trauma.]{.underline}4 As Lorenzo
Veracini puts it, because:¶ '[[settler society']{.underline}]{.mark} can
thus be seen [[as a fantasy where a perception of a constant struggle is
juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can never be
reached]{.mark}, settler projects embrace and reject violence at the
same time. **[The settler colonial situation is]{.mark}**]{.underline}
thus a **[[circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses
produces long-lasting psychic conflicts and]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
number of associated **[[psychopathologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**.5¶
Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on settler-colonial
narrative's view of the past, asking how such a contradictory and
troubled relationship to history might affect present-day ideological
formations. Critics have rarely considered what such narratological
tensions might produce when the settler gaze is turned to the future.
Few social formations are more stubbornly resistant to change than
settlement, suggesting that a future beyond settler colonialism might be
simply unthinkable. Veracini, indeed, suggests that **[settler-colonial
narrative can never contemplate an ending: [that settler decolonization
is inconceivable because settlers lack the metaphorical tools to imagine
their own demise]{.mark}]{.underline}**.6 This article outlines why I
partly disagree with that view. I argue that the narratological paradox
that defines settler-colonial narrative does make the future a
problematic object of contemplation. But that does not make settler
decolonization unthinkable per se; as I will show,
**[[settlers]{.mark}]{.underline}** do often **[[try to imagine their
demise]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- but they do so **[[in a way that
reasserts the paradoxes of their founding ideology,]{.mark} with the
result that the radical potentiality of decolonization is undone even as
it is invoked.]{.underline}**¶ I argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's
analysis, [there is a metaphor via which the end of settler colonialism
unspools -- the quasi-biological concept of extinction, which, when
deployed as a narrative trope, offers settlers a chance to consider and
disavow their demise, just as they consider and then disavow the
violence of their origins]{.underline}. This article traces the
importance of the trope of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial
litera- ture, with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and Australia. It
explores variations in how the death of settler colonialism is
conceptualized, drawing a distinction between his- torio-civilizational
narratives of the rise and fall of empires, [and [a species-oriented
notion of extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} that draws force from public
anxiety about climate change -- an invocation that [[adds another level
of ambivalence by drawing on 'rational' fears for the
future]{.underline}]{.mark} (because climate change may well render the
planet uninhabitable to humans[) [in order to narrativize a form of
social death]{.mark} that, strictly speaking, belongs to a different
order of knowledge altogether]{.underline}. As such, my analysis is
intended to draw the attention of settler- colonial studies toward
futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia, while highlighting a
potential point of cross-fertilization between settler-colonial and
eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.¶ [That 'extinction'
should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon is no
surprise]{.underline}. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [settler [colonialism
is predicated on a 'logic of elimination']{.mark} that tends towards the
extermination -- by one means or another -- [of indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal
settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans
(1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the melancholia and
triumph [[that demarcate settlers' affective responses to the supposed
inevitability of indigenous extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Concepts
like 'stadial development' -- by which societies progress through
stages, progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and 'fatal
impact' -- [which names the biological inevitability of strong peoples
supplanting weak -- all contribute to the notion that settler
colonialism is a kind of 'ecological process' that necessitates the
extinction of inferior races.]{.underline} What is surprising, though,
is how often [the trope of extinction also appears with reference to
settlers themselves; it makes sense for settlers to narrate how their
presence entails others' destruction, but it is less clear why their
attempts to imagine futures should presume extinction to be their own
logical end as well]{.underline}.¶ The idea appears repeatedly in
English-language literary treatments of settler colonial- ism. Consider,
for instance, the following rumination on the future of South African
settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm:¶
It was one of them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those
pictures there. He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make
something, so he made these. \[\...\] Now the Boers have shot them all,
so that we never see a yellow face peeping out among the stones.
\[\...\] And the wild bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here.
But we will be gone soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at
everything like they look now.10¶ In this example, the narrating settler
character, Waldo, recognizes prior indigenous inha- bitation but his
knowledge comes freighted with an expected sense of biological super-
iority, made apparent by his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow
face', and lack of mental self-awareness. What is not clear is why
Waldo's contemplation of colonial geno- cide should turn immediately to
the assumption that a similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar
presumption of racial vulnerability permeates other late nineteenth-
century novels from the imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of
the Worlds,¶ which are plotted around the prospect of invasions that
would see the extinction of British imperialism, and, in the process,
the human species.¶ Such anxieties draw energy from a pattern of settler
defensiveness that can be observed across numerous settler-colonial
contexts. Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of the emergence of
transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical fact that while
white male settlers have been arguably the most privileged class in
history, they have routinely perceived themselves to be 'under siege',
threatened with destruction to the extent that their very identity of
'whiteness was born in the apprehension of immi- nent loss'.11 The fear
of looming annihilation serves a powerful ideological function in
settler communities, working to foster racial solidarity, suppress
dissent, and legitimate violence against indigenous populations who, by
any objective measure, are far more at risk of extermination than the
settlers who fear them. Ann Curthoys and Dirk Moses have traced this
pattern in Australia and Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 **[This
scholarship suggests that narratives of [settler extinction are acts of
ideological mystification, obscuring the brutal inequalities of the
frontier behind a mask of white vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
an argument with which I sympathize. However, this article shows how
there is more to settler-colonial extinction narratives than bad faith.
I argue that [we need a more nuanced understanding of how they encode a
specifically settler-colonial framework for imagining the
future]{.underline}, one that has implications for how we understand
contemporary literatures from settler societies, and which allows us to
see extinction as a genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage social
change.¶ In the remainder of this paper I consider extinction's function
as a metaphor of decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke, without
completely endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argu- ment that to treat
decolonization figuratively, as I argue **[[extinction
narratives]{.mark}]{.underline}** do, is necessarily to **[[preclude
radical change, creating opportunities for settler 'moves to innocence'
that re-legitimate racial inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13 The
counterview to this pessimistic perspec- tive is offered by Veracini,
who suggests that progressive change to settler-colonial relationships
will only happen if narratives can be found that make decolonization
think- able.14 This article enters the debate between these two
perspectives by asking what it means for settler writers to imagine the
future via the trope of extinction. Does extinction offer a meaningful
way to think about ending settler colonialism, or does it re-activate
settler-colonial patterns of thought that allow exclusionary social
structures to persist?¶ I explore this question with reference to
examples of contemporary literary treatments of extinction from select
English-speaking settler-colonial contexts: South Africa, Australia, and
Canada.15 The next section of this article traces key elements of
extinction narrative in a range of settler-colonial texts, while the
section that follows offers a detailed reading of one of the best
examples of a sustained literary exploration of human finitude, Margaret
Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I advance four specific
arguments. First, extinc- tion narratives take at least two forms
depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is framed primarily in
historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger, biological sense; the
key question is whether the 'thing' that is going extinct is a society
or a species. Second, [[biologically oriented extinction narratives rely
on]{.mark}]{.underline} a more or less conscious [[slippage between 'the
settler' and 'the human']{.underline}]{.mark}. Third, [this slippage is
ideologically ambivalent:]{.underline} on the one hand, it contains a
radical charge that invokes environmentalist discourse and
climate-change anxiety to imagine social forms that re-write
settler-colonial dynamics; on the other, it
[[replicates]{.mark}]{.underline} a core aspect of [[imperialist
ideology by normalizing whiteness as¶ equivalent to
humanity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fourth, **[these ideological effects are
mediated by gender,]{.underline}** insofar as **[extinction narratives
invoke issues of biological reproduction, community protection, and
violence that function to differentiate and reify masculine and feminine
roles in the putative de-colonial future.]{.underline}** Overall, my
central claim is that extinction is a core trope through which settler
futurity emerges, one with crucial narrative and ideological effects
that shape much of the contemporary literature emerging from white
colonial settings.

**The alternative is decolonization**

Summary and Conclusions [The most widely used sociological frameworks
for theorizing race relations]{.underline} in the United States [have
focused on generating analyses that encompass not just anti-black racism
but also anti-Latino and antiAsian American racisms.]{.underline} What
these frameworks share is an appreciation that racial hierarchy and
inequality are not simply the products of individual beliefs and
attitudes but are built into American social structure and that whites
have historically benefited from racial inequality. I have found each of
the major frameworks, internal colonialism, racial formation, and
racialized social systems, useful in my own work in comparative race and
gender studies. **[However, what [these theories do not
explicitly]{.mark} [consider]{.mark} is whether and in what ways [U.S.
national and]{.mark} regional [racial systems]{.mark} may be unique
and/or idiosyncratic [because they have grown out of]{.mark} distinct
material, social, and cultural circumstances, in this case, U.S.
[settler colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I have offered the concept
of ["[settler colonialism]{.mark} as structure," [as a framework]{.mark}
that [encourages and facilitates comparativity within and across regions
and time]{.mark}.]{.underline} I believe that a [settler colonial
structural analysis reveals the underlying systems of beliefs,
practices, and institutional systems that undergird and link the
racialization and management of Native Americans, blacks, Mexicans and
other Latinos, and Chinese and other Asian Americans that I have
described herein.]{.underline} What are these underlying
systems/structures? First, [the defining characteristic of settler
colonialism is its intention to acquire and occupy land on which to
settle permanently, instead of merely to exploit resources.]{.underline}
In order to realize this goal, [the indigenous people who occupy the
land have to be eliminated. Thus, one logic of settler colonial policy
has been the ultimate erasure of Native Americans.]{.underline} This
goal was pursued through various forms of genocide, ranging from
military violence to biological and cultural assimilation. British
settler colonialism in what became the United States was particularly
effective because it promoted family settlement right from the
beginning. Thus, [the growth of the settler population and its westward
movement was continuous and relentless.]{.underline} **[[Settler
ideology justified elimination via the belief that the savage, heathen,
uncivilized indigenes were not making productive use of the land or its
resources.]{.mark} Thus, they inevitably had to give way to enlightened
and civilized Europeans. The difference between indigenes and settlers
was simultaneously racialized and gendered]{.underline}**. [While
racializing Native ways of life and Native Americans as "other,"
settlers developed their selfidentities as "white," equating
civilization and democracy with whiteness.]{.underline} [Indian
masculinity was viewed as primitive and violent, while Indian women were
viewed as lacking feminine modesty and restraint.]{.underline} With
independence from the metropole, the founders imagined the new nation as
a white republic governed by and for white men. Second, [in order to
realize a profitable return from the land, settlers sought to
intensively cultivate it for agriculture, extract resources, and build
the infrastructure for both cultivation and extraction.]{.underline} For
this purpose, especially on large-scale holdings that were available in
the New World, extensive labor power was needed. As we have seen,
[[settlers in all regions enslaved Native Americans,]{.mark} and the
transnational trade in Native slaves helped to finance the building of
Southern plantations.]{.underline} However, in the long run, [settlers
could not amass a large enough Indigenous slave workforce both because
indigenes died in large numbers from European diseases and because they
could sometimes escape and then survive in the wilderness. Settlers thus
turned to African slave labor. Slave labor power could generate profit
for the owner in a variety of ways: by performing field labor,
processing raw materials, and producing goods for use or sale and by
being leased out to others to earn money for the owner.]{.underline}
What linked land taking from indigenes and black chattel slavery was a
private property regime that converted people, ideas, and things into
property that could be bought, owned, and sold. [The purchase,
ownership, and sale of property, whether inanimate or human, were
regularized by property law or in the case of chattel slaves, by slave
law.]{.underline} Generally, ownership entails the right to do whatever
one wants with one's property---to sell, lend, or rent it and to seize
the profits extracted from its use. **[[The elimination of Native
Americans and the enslavement of blacks form two nodes that have
anchored U.S. racial formation. Redness has been made to
disappear]{.mark}, such that contemporary Native Americans have become
largely invisible in white consciousness. In contrast, [blackness has
been made hypervisible, and blacks are constantly present as an imagined
threat to whites and the settler colonial social
order.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As pointed out earlier, Indianness is
thought to be diluted and then to disappear through miscegenation,
[while blackness is thought to be continually reproduced even through
generations of miscegenation.]{.underline} In this respect as well as
others, [the racialization of blacks---the irredeemability and
dehumanization of blacks---has been incommensurable with the
racialization of other groups.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the
racialization of certain (in Lorenzo Veracini's term) exogenous others
has been a prominent feature of settler colonial societies. In the
United States, some groups have been recruited and/or tracked into hard
labor and super-exploited because they can be induced to work by need
and kept in place by restricted mobility. For a nation that purports to
stand for freedom, opportunity, and equality, the United States has had
a long history of imposing coercive labor regimes, social segregation,
and restricted mobility on many of its residents. [[Racializing certain
groups as insufficiently human serves to justify subjecting them to
oppression]{.mark}, subordination, and super-exploitation.]{.underline}
Thus[, [conditions of compelled labor short of chattel
slavery]{.mark}---]{.underline}contract labor, sharecropping, payment in
scrip, wages paid only after completion of a long period of work---[were
legally allowed and commonly imposed on racialized others even after the
abolition of slavery]{.underline}. These practices were designed to
immobilize and disable workers' ability to survive by other means and
thereby tie down theoretically free workers. These forms of coercion
might be labeled de facto slavery because they do not involve ownership
of the person and the enforcement of slave law. [The experiences of
national and local policies toward Mexicans and Chinese
were]{.underline} examined herein to help illuminate the
[linked]{.underline} processes of [racialization and super-exploitation
in U.S. settler colonialism.]{.underline} Racialization has been
integral to resolving the contradiction between settler ideologies of
freedom, equality, and progress and the unfreedom, inequality, and
denial of mobility and citizenship rights to Mexican Americans in the
Southwest and Chinese Americans in the Far West. The various
technologies of control and management (segregation, cultural erasure,
terrorism, expulsion, and legal exclusion) served the interests of
capitalism by enabling landowners, plantation owners, and railroad
companies to super-exploit these exogenous others. At the same time,
racialization of "others" enabled white workers to reap a psychic
reward, the so-called "wages of whiteness" to succor the wounds
inflicted by class inferiority. The case studies of Mexican Americans
and Chinese Americans further illustrate the importance of paying
attention to both the specificities and differences and the connections
and commonalities among and between the experiences of various
racialized others. Some of the major technologies for control and
management of racialized groups were similar, most prominently the use
of terrorism. It could be argued that **[[the continuous history of
genocide against Native Americans helped to normalize the use of extreme
violence against non-white "others."]{.mark} Extreme violence was
rationalized as necessary to ensure settler security.]{.underline}** As
described, not only blacks, but also Mexicans and Chinese were subjected
to extreme and disproportionate violence that might well be
characterized as ethnic cleansing. And, as in the case of the denial of
the founding violence against Native Americans, white settler culture
either denied or forgot its violence toward Mexicans and Chinese by
magnifying the threat they posed not only to individual whites but also
to the nation. [[The technology of erasure through cultural assimilation
practiced on Native Americans was also employed]{.underline}]{.mark} on
Mexican Americans. In both cases, schooling was intended to prepare
girls and boys for gender-appropriate domestic and vocational skills.
[The speaking of children's natal languages was punished, and
mainstream]{.underline} (white/ Anglo) [ways of living were
valorized.]{.underline} **[Education was also intended to teach
racialized children "their place" in American society, that is, to
accept and be satisfied with a limited future.]{.underline}** The
technologies unique to Mexicans and Chinese were those of mass
deportation and legal exclusion. Native Americans could be and were
removed to remote reservations in the United States and in a few
instances driven across the Southern border into Mexico, but they were
not legally deported. Removal of freed blacks and resettling them in
Africa was tried after the Civil War, but the number of those removed
was only a small proportion of the population. Whites in the South were
able to re-impose a white supremacist order that could control and
super-exploit black labor. However, once the transcontinental railroad
was completed, Chinese labor was not strictly necessary in the West, and
moreover, as immigrants, the Chinese could more easily be subjected to
expulsion and exclusion. In fact, the Chinese were the first immigrant
group subject to exclusion, first through the Page Act of 1875 and the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and then through the Immigration Act of
1924 that extended exclusion to cover other Asian peoples.As described
earlier, for nearly a century after the U.S. takeover of the Southwest,
Mexican nationals and Mexican Americans were able to cross back and
forth across the southern border more or less freely. However, this
situation began to change during the 1920s with the establishment of the
U.S. Border Patrol. Because of high unemployment during the Great
Depression, Mexican Americans became the first group subject to mass
deportation. A second large-scale deportation occurred during another
period of unemployment in the 1950s under Operation Wetback. The first
decades of the twenty-first century saw the creation and establishment
of a vast federal machinery for "safeguarding" our borders, ostensibly
to battle terrorism. This machinery has been wielded primarily against
Mexicans, who are viewed as constituting a different kind of threat, a
menace to "mainstream" American (white) culture. Thus, the majority of
deportees continues to be immigrants from Mexico. Throughout my
historical analyses of settler colonial structures and practices as they
developed in relation to Indigenous peoples, blacks, Mexicans, and
Chinese, I have tried to apply an intersectional lens that views race
and gender as co-formations. The bulk of the discussion has perhaps
focused greater attention on race and racialization; however, gender has
been present throughout the text. I pointed out that the settler project
constructed various racialized gender and gendered racial dualisms. [The
white race was masculinized in relation to feminized black, red, or
yellow races. Settler ideology also defined appropriate gender relations
within the settler family and community, variously using Indian, black,
and "others" as negative foils. White settler society understood extreme
gender differentiation as a mark of civilization and thus attempted to
shape white womanhood toward domesticity and dependency. Importantly,
white women were viewed as needing to be protected by white men,
particularly from the dangers posed by the primitive or perverse male
sexuality of Natives, slaves, and exogenous others. Thus, for example,
lurid tales of Indian capture of white women and their rescue by white
soldiers circulated widely in settler culture. Meanwhile, Indian, black,
and exogenous women were viewed variously as shameless, docile,
alluring, or unfeminine because they did "men's work." **[Settler
colonialism also had different effects on men and women from subjugated
groups as shown in several instances discussed in the main]{.mark}
text**]{.underline}. For example, it was mentioned that Indian women
were more likely to be enslaved, while adult Indian men were more likely
to be killed. Relatedly, Indian women were also more likely to be
brought into settler households to be sex slaves and domestic servants.
As for the Chinese, although male laborers were eventually subject to
exclusion, women had been legally excluded earlier and more stringently
on the assumption that all Chinese women attempting to enter were
prostitutes. In contrast, Mexican women were sometimes viewed more
favorably than Mexican men and were thought to be appropriate wives for
Anglo men. As for enslaved blacks, women were subjected to
gender-specific violence such as rape but not exempted from the same
kinds of physical punishment and heavy field labor to which slave men
were subjected. I will now briefly consider the implications of the
present analysis in relation to anti-racist politics. Given that many
different groups have been victimized by racial violence, exclusion, and
dehumanization, coalitions among racialized minorities are desirable and
necessary. I suggest that coalitions are best built by recognizing the
specific histories of racialized minorities other than our own. [[Our
understandings ideally should reckon with (a) commonalities, (b)
relations and connections, and (c) difference]{.mark}s]{.underline}. All
of these are highlighted by this settler colonial analysis. [Many
commonalities have emerged from the case analyses, including experiences
of genocide and terrorism that have been inflicted, justified, and
"forgotten" or deemphasized by settler society.]{.underline} Also having
emerged are relations/connections in the experiences of different groups
that complicate their positionality vis-à- vis one another. Thus, for
example, the analysis might lead us to ask whether and in what ways
racialized minorities might position themselves in relation to the
territorial dispossession of Native Americans. Finally, some significant
differences have emerged; for example, only blacks were subjected to
chattel slavery, which is a condition of social death and subjection by
slave law that even those who worked under conditions of extreme
coercion did not share. A final thought: in this article I have
suggested that [a settler colonialism framework for analyzing and
understanding race and gender in America will have]{.underline} certain
[advantages over other frameworks]{.underline}, most specifically in the
strength of its historicity and in a fuller incorporation of the role of
Native Americans in how racism and gender oppression have developed and
continue to operate. [[A question with which I have not dealt is to what
extent can a settler colonial framework relate to and interact with
other frameworks such as internal colonialism, racial formation, and
racialized social systems]{.underline}.]{.mark} My belief is that there
are significant insights and analytical methods offered by each of the
frameworks and that the addition of settler colonialism to the mix may
help us to work toward a higher level theoretical model that can be
widely used by social scientists both in the United States and
internationally. I suggest that a fruitful next task will be for us to
explore and discuss the connections and relationships among the various
frameworks, with a new awareness of the distinct historical, social, and
cultural understandings brought to our table by the settler colonialism
framework.

If nineteenth-century American literary studies tends to focus on the
ways Indians enter the narrative frame and the kinds of meanings and
associations they bear, [recent attempts to theorize settler colonialism
have sought to shift attention from its effects on Indigenous subjects
to its implications for nonnative political attachments, forms of
inhabitance, and modes of being]{.underline}, illuminating and tracking
the pervasive operation of settlement as a system. In Settler
Colonialism and the Transformation of Anthropology, Patrick Wolfe
argues, "[Settler colonies were (are) premised on the elimination of
native societies.]{.underline} [The split tensing reflects a determinate
feature of settler colonization. The colonizers come to
stay---**[invasion is a structure not an event]{.mark}**]{.underline}"
(2).6 He suggests that [[a "logic of elimination" drives settler
governance and sociality]{.underline}]{.mark}, describing "[[the
settler-colonial will]{.mark}" as "a historical force that [ultimately
derives from the primal drive to expansion]{.mark} that is generally
glossed as capitalism]{.underline}" (167), and in "Settler Colonialism
and the Elimination of the Native," he observes that "[[elimination is
an **organizing principle of settler-colonial society**]{.mark} rather
than a one-off]{.underline} (and superceded) [occurrence]{.underline}"
(388). [Rather than being superseded after an initial moment/ period of
conquest, colonization persists since "the logic of elimination marks a
return whereby the native repressed continues to structure
settlercolonial society]{.underline}" (390). In Aileen
Moreton-Robinson's work, [whiteness func - tions as the central way of
understanding the domination and displacement of Indigenous peoples by
nonnatives]{.underline}.7 In "Writing Off Indigenous Sovereignty," she
argues, "As a regime of power, patriarchal white sovereignty operates
ideologically, materially and discursively to reproduce and maintain its
investment in the nation as a white possession" (88), and in "Writing
Off Treaties," she suggests, "[[At an ontological level the structure of
subjective possession occurs through **the imposition of one's
will-to-be on the thing which is perceived to lack will**, thus it is
open to being possessed]{.underline}]{.mark}," such that
"[**[possession]{.mark}** . . . **[forms]{.mark}** part of **[the
ontological structure of white subjectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}"
(83--84). For Jodi Byrd, the deployment of Indianness as a mobile figure
works as the principal mode of U.S. settler colonialism. She observes
that "[[colonization and racialization]{.mark} . . . [have]{.mark} often
[been conflated]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[in ways
that]{.underline}]{.mark} "tend to be sited along the axis of
inclusion/exclusion" and that "[[misdirect and cloud attention from the
underlying structures of settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(xxiii, xvii). She argues that [[settlement works through the
translation of indigeneity as Indianness]{.mark}, casting place-based
political collectivities as (racialized) populations subject to U.S.
jurisdiction and management: "[the Indian is left nowhere and everywhere
within the ontological premises through which U.S. empire
orients,]{.mark} imagines, and critiques [itself]{.mark}]{.underline} ";
"[[ideas of]{.mark}]{.underline} Indians and [[Indianness have served as
the ontological ground through which U.S. settler colonialism enacts
itself]{.mark} "]{.underline} (xix).

#### Settler colonialism is a structure, erasing indigenous peoples and making savage their relationship with the environment causing constant and profound violence.

Our intention in this descriptive exercise is not be exhaustive, or even
inarguable; instead, we wish to emphasize that (a) decolonization will
take a different shape in each of these contexts - though they can
overlap - and that (b) neither external nor internal colonialism
adequately describe the form of colonialism which operates in the United
States or other nation-states in which the colonizer comes to stay.
[Settler colonialism operates through internal/external colonial modes
simultaneously because there is no spatial separation between metropole
and colony.]{.underline} For example, [in the United States, many
Indigenous peoples have been forcibly removed from their homelands onto
reservations, indentured, and abducted into state custody, signaling the
form of colonization as simultaneously internal (via boarding schools
and other biopolitical modes of control) and external (via uranium
mining on Indigenous land in the US Southwest and oil extraction on
Indigenous land in Alaska) with a frontier (the US military still
nicknames all enemy territory "Indian Country").]{.underline} **[[The
horizons of the settler colonial nation-state]{.mark}]{.underline}** are
total and **[[require]{.mark}]{.underline}** a mode of **[[total
appropriation of Indigenous life and land]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather
than the selective expropriation of profit-producing fragments. [Settler
colonialism is different from other forms of colonialism]{.underline} in
that [settlers come with the intention of making a new home on the
land,]{.underline} a homemaking [[that insists on settler sovereignty
over all things]{.underline}]{.mark} in their new domain. Thus,
**[relying]{.underline}** solely **[on postcolonial literatures
or]{.underline}** theories of **[coloniality that ignore settler
colonialism will not help to envision the shape that decolonization must
take in settler colonial contexts]{.underline}**. Within settler
colonialism, the most important concern is land/water/air/subterranean
earth (land, for shorthand, in this article.) [Land is what is most
valuable, contested, required]{.underline}. [This is both because the
[settlers make ]{.mark}]{.underline}Indigenous [[land
their]{.mark}]{.underline} new home and [[source of
capital,]{.mark}]{.underline} and also because [[the disruption of
Indigenous relationships to land represents]{.mark}]{.underline} a
profound [**[epistemic, ontological, cosmological
violence]{.underline}**. [This violence is not temporally
contained]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the arrival of the settler [but is
reasserted each day of occupation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is why
Patrick Wolfe (1999) emphasizes that **[[settler colonialism is a
structure and not an event]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the process of
settler colonialism, [land is remade into property and human
relationships to land are restricted to the relationship of the owner to
his property]{.underline}. Epistemological, ontological, and
cosmological relationships to land are interred, indeed made pre-modern
and backward. Made savage. [In order for the settlers to make a place
their home, they must destroy and disappear the Indigenous peoples that
live there.]{.underline} Indigenous peoples are those who have creation
stories, not colonization stories, about how we/they came to be in a
particular place - indeed how we/they came to be a place. [Our/their
relationships to land comprise our/their epistemologies, ontologies, and
cosmologies.]{.underline} For the settlers, Indigenous peoples are in
the way and, in the destruction of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous
communities, and over time and through law and policy, Indigenous
peoples' claims to land under settler regimes, land is recast as
property and as a resource. **[Indigenous peoples must be erased, must
be made into ghosts]{.underline}** (Tuck and Ree, forthcoming). At the
same time, [settler colonialism [involves the subjugation and forced
labor of chattel slaves, whose bodies and lives become the property, and
who are kept landless]{.mark}.]{.underline} Slavery in settler colonial
contexts is distinct from other forms of indenture whereby excess labor
is extracted from persons. First, [chattels are commodities of labor and
therefore it is [the slave's person that is the
excess]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second, unlike workers who may aspire to
own land, the slave's very presence on the land is already an excess
that must be dis-located. Thus, [the slave is a desirable commodity but
the person underneath is imprisonable, punishable, and murderable. [The
violence of keeping/killing the chattel slave makes them deathlike
monsters in the settler imagination]{.mark}]{.underline}; they are
reconfigured/disfigured as the threat, the razor's edge of safety and
terror. The settler, if known by his actions and how he justifies them,
sees himself as holding dominion over the earth and its flora and fauna,
as the anthropocentric normal, and as more developed, more human, more
deserving than other groups or species. The settler is making a new
\"home\" and that home is rooted in a homesteading worldview where the
wild land and wild people were made for his benefit. He can only make
his identity as a settler by making the land produce, and produce
excessively, because \"civilization\" is defined as production in excess
of the \"natural\" world (i.e. in excess of the sustainable production
already present in the Indigenous world). In order for excess
production, he needs excess labor, which he cannot provide himself.
[[The chattel slave serves as that excess labor, labor that can never be
paid because payment would have to be in the form of property
(land]{.mark}).]{.underline} The settler\'s wealth is land, or a
fungible version of it, and so payment for labor is impossible.6 The
settler positions himself as both superior and normal; the settler is
natural, whereas the Indigenous inhabitant and the chattel slave are
unnatural, even supernatural. [Settlers are not immigrants.]{.underline}
Immigrants are beholden to the Indigenous laws and epistemologies of the
lands they migrate to. Settlers become the law, supplanting Indigenous
laws and epistemologies. Therefore, settler nations are not immigrant
nations (See also A.J. Barker, 2009). Not unique, the United States, as
a settler colonial nation-state, also operates as an empire - utilizing
external forms and internal forms of colonization simultaneous to the
settler colonial project[.]{.underline} This means, and this is
perplexing to some, that dispossessed people are brought onto seized
Indigenous land through other colonial projects. Other colonial projects
include enslavement, as discussed, but also military recruitment,
low-wage and high-wage labor recruitment (such as agricultural workers
and overseas-trained engineers), and displacement/migration (such as the
coerced immigration from nations torn by U.S. wars or devastated by U.S.
economic policy). [In this set of settler colonial relations, colonial
subjects who are displaced by external colonialism, as well as
racialized and minoritized by internal colonialism, still occupy and
settle stolen Indigenous land. [Settlers are diverse, not just
]{.mark}]{.underline}of [[white]{.mark} European descent, and include
people of color]{.underline}, even from other colonial contexts. [This
tightly wound set of conditions and racialized, globalized relations
exponentially complicates what is meant by decolonization, and by
solidarity, against settler colonial forces.]{.underline} Decolonization
in exploitative colonial situations could involve the seizing of
imperial wealth by the postcolonial subject. In settler colonial
situations, seizing imperial wealth is inextricably tied to settlement
and re-invasion. Likewise, the promise of integration and civil rights
is predicated on securing a share of a settler-appropriated wealth (as
well as expropriated 'third-world' wealth). Decolonization in a settler
context is fraught because empire, settlement, and internal colony have
no spatial separation. Each of these features of settler colonialism in
the US context - empire, settlement, and internal colony - make it a
site of contradictory decolonial desires7. **[[Decolonization as
metaphor allows people to equivocate]{.mark}]{.underline}** these
**[[contradictory decolonial desires because it turns decolonization
into an empty signifier to be filled by any track towards
liberation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In reality, [the tracks walk all over
land/people in settler contexts.]{.underline} Though the details are not
fixed or agreed upon, in our view, [[decolonization]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the settler colonial context [[must involve the repatriation of
land]{.mark} simultaneous to the recognition of how land and relations
to land have always already been differently understood and enacted;
that is, all of the land, and not just symbolically.]{.underline} [This
is precisely why decolonization is]{.underline} necessarily [unsettling,
especially across lines of solidarity]{.underline}. "Decolonization
never takes place unnoticed" (Fanon, 1963, p. 36). **[Settler
colonialism and its decolonization implicates and unsettles
everyone.]{.underline}**

[[In referring to the function of social contract theory in relation to
settler colonialism,]{.mark} I have chosen to speak of [the settler
contract]{.mark}. In using the term settler contract, I am deliberately
playing off of previous work by philosophers and political theorists who
have been concerned to [show the historical function and development of
social contract theory in relation to specific axes of oppression and
domination.]{.mark}]{.underline} Two of the most important contributions
to this literature are Carole Pateman's The Sexual Contract and Mills's
The Racial Contract. In Pateman's 1988 work, she rereads the canon of
Western social contract theory in an attempt to demonstrate that the
presumptively neutral and ideal accounts of the origins of civil society
as presented in the works of, for instance, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau
were in fact always (implicitly or explicitly) sexual-patriarchal
narratives that legitimized the subordination of women.4 In 1995 Mills
deliberately borrowed from Pateman in his project of unmasking the
racial (or, more precisely, white-supremacist) nature of the contract.
There Mills defines the "racial contract" as that set of formal or
informal agreements or meta-agreements . . . between the members of one
subset of humans, henceforth designated by (shifting) "racial"
(phenotypical/genealogical/cultural) criteria c1, c2, c3\[,\] . . . as
"white," and coextensive (making due allowance for gender
differentiation) with the class of full persons, to categorize the
remaining subset of humans as "nonwhite" and of a different and inferior
moral status, subpersons, so that they have a subordinate civil standing
in the white or white-ruled polities the whites either already inhabit
or establish or in transactions as aligns with these polities, and the
moral and juridical rules normally regulating the behaviour of whites in
their dealings with one another either do not apply at all in dealings
with nonwhites or apply only in a qualified form.5 [Although they have
not necessarily used the specific term of settler contract, for some
time now various thinkers have attempted to contribute to an expansion
on these themes by demonstrating the ways in which [social contract
theory has served as a primary justificatory device for the
establishment of another axis of oppression and domination: an
expropriation and usurpation contract whereby the constitution of the
ideal civil society is premised upon the extermination of Indigenous
peoples or the displacement of them from their
lands.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, the term settler contract
originally de- rives from Pateman's use of the phrase in a chapter of a
recently published book, coauthored with Charles Mills.6 While I am
obviously indebted to this work, there are certain modifications I would
like to make to Pateman's use of the phrase for my own purposes. [First,
while Pateman uses the term to refer to the notion that when founding
new polities, [settler colonizers implicitly or explicitly denied the
existence of Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, I propose a more modest and
qualified use. It is my belief that although this may be the case in
some specific instances, as an empirical claim it is overextended. It is
not the case that all settlers---or even most settlers---denied the
existence of previous societies. In fact, it is often the case that
actual settlers on the ground recognized Indigenous title, in contrast
to the theoretical pictures given of Indigenous peoples in prevailing
theories of the time.7 More narrowly then, [the term settler contract
references the strategic use of the fiction of a society as the product
of a contract between its founding members only insofar as it is
employed in these historical moments to displace the question of that
society's actual formation in acts of conquest, genocide, and land
appropriation. The term's reactivation is used not to deny the content
of the claims of specific Indigenous peoples, but rather to shift the
register of argumentation to a highly abstract and counterfactual level,
relieving the burden of proof from colonial states. Settler contract
then refers to the dual legitimating function of the philosophical and
historical-narrative device of the original contract as the origins of
societal order: first, by presupposing no previous Indigenous societies,
and, second, by legitimizing the violence required to turn this fiction
into reality]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Asian Americans

#### The 1AC is premised upon a fantasy of belonging and the creation of a multicultural nation for Asian Americans -- that creates a settler will to innocence and recreates the logic of settlement.

[We can first trace Asian American critiques of US empire to the
1968--1969 Third World Strike at what was then San
Francisco]{.underline} State College. [The Third World Liberation Front
(TWLF) brought together African American, Asian American, Latino/a, and
American Indian campus groups demanding an autonomous ethnic studies
program and community control over curricula and hiring, and the TWLF
drew critical connections between domestic civil rights struggles in the
United States and international human rights struggles in imperial wars
being fought in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.]{.underline} As an
[historical event linking racism in the United States with US
imperialism, the Third World Strike reminds us that ethnic studies was
founded on conceptions of shared struggles on a global
scale]{.underline}. There is another dimension to the Third World Strike
that Asian American critical inquiry must consider. [At the same time
that the Third World Strike was taking place, American Indians were
engaged in the second occupation of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco
Bay. Asserting American Indian title to the federal facility by right of
discovery, American Indian activists at Alcatraz initiated the
Alcatraz-Red Power movement (ARPM) which led to 70 property takeovers in
the following nine years]{.underline} (Johnson et al. 1997). Similarly,
in 1976, Kanaka ' Oiwi were engaged in struggles to reclaim Kaho'olawe,
an island that had been used since the Second World War as a site for
bombing target practice by the US military. [These struggles illustrate
that although American Indians and Kanaka ' Oiwi were allied with people
of color on civil rights issues and against US imperialism, their
primary struggle was to reclaim their ancestral lands from the United
States. **[Although Asian]{.mark} American[s]{.mark},**]{.underline}
particularly Japanese Americans **[[who were critical of the US
political system]{.mark} after their internment during World War II,
[supported American Indians]{.mark}]{.underline}** at Alcatraz and
Hawaiians at Kaho'olawe in important ways, **[[they used a framework of
race and class struggle that did not account for the uniqueness of
indigenous land dispossession or their own positions in a settler
colonial context]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Johnson 1996: 118; Gidra 1970;
Tanioka and Yamaguchi 1970; Kudaka 1970; Kotani 1985: 168--169).4 As I
have argued elsewhere, [[Asian]{.mark} American]{.underline} studies as
a discipline has also historically [[had a stake in claiming America in
ways that are ideologically at odds with indigenous critiques of US
settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}(Fujikane 2005[). Asian American
studies has generally focused on Asian American civil rights and
immigrant rights, histories of racial, ethnic, heteropatriarchal and
class oppression and literary, cultural and political forms of
resistance to those interlocking axes of oppression, interracial and
interethnic conflicts and alliances, movements of people to and from the
United States in terms of immigration, diaspora, transnational mobility
and the international divisions of labor, and multiple forms of
imperialisms in Asia. In a [multicultural ethnic]{.mark} studies
framework, claiming [America often]{.mark} inadvertently [ends up
reproducing the settler colonial claims to Native lands]{.mark} made in
white settler historiography. [Kanaka ' Oiwi]{.mark}]{.underline} leader
and scholar Haunani-Kay Trask [first [identified Asian]{.mark}
American[s]{.mark}]{.underline} in Hawai'i [[as settlers who benefit
from the dispossession of]{.mark} Hawaiians]{.underline}. Trask writes,
Our [[Native people and territories]{.mark} have been overrun by
non-Natives, including Asians]{.underline}. **[Calling themselves
'local', the children of Asian settlers greatly outnumber
us]{.underline}**. [They]{.underline} claim Hawai'i as their own,
[denying indigenous history, their long collaboration in our continued
dispossession, and the benefits therefrom. Part of this denial is the
substitution of the term 'local' for 'immigrant', which is, itself, a
particularly celebrated American gloss for 'settler']{.underline}. As on
the continent, so in our island home. [[Settlers and their children
recast the American tale of nationhood]{.underline}]{.mark}: Hawai'i,
like the continent, is naturalized as but another telling illustration
of the uniqueness of America's 'nation of immigrants'. (Trask 2008: 46)5
Kanaka Oiwi are genealogically connected to Hawai'i, their kulaiwi or
ancestral lands, through Papahanaumoku, 'She who births land'
(ho'omanawanui 2008: 125; Kamahele 2008: 79; Trask 2008: 45). Under the
US occupation of Hawai'i, [[Asian]{.mark} American[s are settlers who do
not have this genealogical relationship to land]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Hawai'i. As Trask points out, [[the failure to identify immigrants in
settler states as settlers makes possible the teleological fantasy of
settler states evolving into 'multicultural'
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} (Trask 2008: 47). [The effects of Asian
American settler colonialism become even more visible when we examine
indices that register political]{.underline} [power]{.underline} in
Hawai'i, such as the ethnic breakdown of the 2009 Hawai'i State
Legislature (see Table 1). According to these figures, Japanese
constitute only 21.9% of the population of Hawai'i, but they are 40% of
the Senate and 38% of the House of Representatives (Okinawans are
included in statistics for 'Japanese', but separately they are about 4%
of the population, 12% of the Senate and 6% of the House). Whites
constitute 21.1% of the population, 16% of the Senate, and 20% of the
House. By contrast, Hawaiians constitute 22.1% of the population
compared with 16% of the Senate and 14% of the House. Overall, Asian
Americans make up about 44% of the population, 64% of the Senate and 72%
of the House. [[The conditions of Asian]{.mark} American [settler
colonialism are only made possible by the US settler state]{.mark} and
its occupation of Hawai'i]{.underline}. The United States has
acknowledged that its military unlawfully invaded Hawai'i and backed the
overthrow of the Hawaiian government by a white American oligarchy on
January 17, 1893. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed US Public Law
103-150, apologizing for the United States' role in the military
invasion and overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. In the Apology
Resolution, the United States acknowledges that Kanaka ' Oiwi have never
relinquished their sovereignty: 'The indigenous Hawaiian people never
directly relinquished their inherent sovereignty as a people or over
their national lands to the United States, either through their monarchy
or through a plebiscite or referendum'. The document also acknowledges
the illegal seizure of Hawaiian national lands: 'The Republic of Hawaii
also ceded 1,800,000 acres of crown, government and public lands of the
Kingdom of Hawaii without the consent of or compensation to the Native
Hawaiian people of Hawaii or their sovereign government'. The Apology
Resolution has been cited to argue that the sovereign state of Hawai'i
continues to exist, and Kanaka ' Oiwi can assert their claim to 1.8
million acres of crown and government lands called the 'ceded' lands,
half of all land in Hawai'i seized at the time of the overthrow and now
administered by the State of Hawai'i.6

Introduction The combination of liberalism and war has been a recurrent
fascination for scholars and critics of US foreign policy. Post 9/11 US
foreign policy, characterised not only by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,
but also by a militarised counterterrorism policy, has only increased
interest in the connections between liberalism and war. Discussions of
the paradoxes of liberal wars became commonplace in the post-Cold War
era (Dunne, 2009; Freedman, 2005; 1 I would like to thank Maja
Cederberg, Emily Gilbert, Anna Stavrianakis and Srdjan Vucetic for their
feedback on various drafts, which helped greatly in clarifying the
argument and writing. The two anonymous reviewers also helped improve
the focus of the piece. Earlier feedback on the project from Chris
Browning and Martin Shaw was also much appreciated. 2 c.f. Sørensen,
2006). While proponents of a Kantian 'democratic peace' believed that
the spread of liberal democracies would lead to peace (at least amongst
a community of democracies) (e.g. Brown et al., 1996), this was
contrasted with an increasing bellicosity of relations with
non-democracies (Desch, 2007/2008; Geis and Wagner, 2011; c.f. Jahn,
2005). These wars against illiberal spaces were seen by some as forms of
humanitarian intervention premised on the universalism of liberal
values, where war could be waged in the name of peace (e.g. Wheeler,
2000). However, critics have argued that war was being used as a means
to impose particular sets of values and 'peacefulness' through state
building (Chandler, 2002; c.f. Dodge, 2013). The practices of the US-led
'Global War on Terror' were based on such liberal premises, beginning a
decade of war and intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, postwar
'stability operations' and counterinsurgency, continuing today through
various interventionary practices associated with military advisors,
special operations and drone strikes (Gregory, 2011; Niva, 2013; Shaw,
2013**[). Much critical work [in security studies]{.mark} has seen [the
liberal wars of the 'War on Terror' as an extension of US
imperialism]{.mark}, a way of creating new spaces of neoliberal
accumulation]{.underline}** (Neocleous, 2014), **[or as part of a
general extension of neoliberal governmentality and
biopolitics]{.underline}** (Dillon and Reid, 2009; Evans, 2010). While
this work has brought many insights, it has lacked a longer historical
perspective on the institutionalisation of liberal war, as well as an
over-attention to the violent practices of war at the expense of its
links to broader social structures. 2 The article argues that a
strengthened and historicised concept of militarism can help provide a
deeper understanding of the links between liberal wars and the
institutionalisation of military power within liberal states. Militarism
has long been a focus for understanding the political character of
states and their propensity to war (Berghahn, 1984; Vagts, 1959).
Contemporary debates about US foreign policy have reinvigorated a
critical analysis of the role of militarism in the international system
(Bacevich, 2006; Goodman, 2013; Johnson, 2004). While it is clear that
the concept itself is meant to refer to a proclivity to the use of force
(and military power) in 2 This is not the case with the work on gender
and war, which has explicitly focused on militarism, especially in terms
of the reproduction of gender identities and structures of militarism,
as well as an embedded ideology of militarism. For example, see: Enloe,
2000; Sylvester, 2012; and Whitworth, 2007. 3 foreign policy, these
analyses have not always made the scope of US militarism clear. As
Stavrianakis and Selby (2012) have noted, part of the issue is the real
variety of ways in which militarism has been conceived of analytically,
especially in terms of an overly narrow focus on particular dispositions
and behaviours and a tendency towards over-generalisation about
militarism itself. These issues in conceptualisation tended to gloss
over the militarism of liberal states and differentiations between
militarisms across states and societies. The present analysis draws on
the final category discussed by Stavrianakis and Selby (2012), the
sociological, which enables the conceptualisation of a militarism of
liberal states that is different organizationally than others but has
similar effects. Liberalism and war can be fruitfully examined through
the historical sociological literature on militarism, which more clearly
situates militarism as a historical phenomenon and links its specific
dynamics to the institutional characteristics of particular polities,
societies and economies (Mann, 1987, 1988, 1996; Shaw, 1988, 2005, 2012;
c.f. Berghahn, 1984; Gillis, 1989). As Mann notes, militarism needs to
be seen as 'a set of attitudes and social practices which regards war
and the preparation for war as a normal and desirable social activity'
(1987: 35). In this fashion militarism is both a disposition that
justifies particular security or military practices and a particular
constellation of social forces surrounding the military and the
institutionalisation of military power, that vary with time and place.
The advantage of this approach is that it more concretely connects war
as a social practice to the interplay of military institutions,
political economy and social relations, seeing the contingent character
of institutional development while not ignoring longer-term
continuities. The article provides an account of 'liberal' militarism
focused on longer-term historical processes embedded in a liberal
political economy that can clarify issues of continuity and change
(Edgerton, 1991, 2006; Joana and Mérand, 2014). Liberal militarism has
historically focused on an expansive and crusading ideology, on
technology and capitalintensive warfare, and based on socio-economic
interventions linked to liberal political economy (Edgerton, 1991). 3
Crucially, all three dimensions are part of a modernising project 3 Mann
(1996) also developed a category of 'liberal militarism', which mainly
refers to various forms of 'civil society' militarisms: on the one hand
a national-based mass mobilization, and on the other, a more autonomous
bottom-up militarism that was encouraged by but often separate from the
state. While these have 4 that aims to use war and military power to
solve the 'problem' of illiberal (and 'uncivilised') states. The article
makes the case in three steps. First, it goes into more detail
concerning the concept of liberal militarism and its relationship to
other critical perspectives on liberalism and war. Drawing on the
historical sociological literature, it delineates liberal militarism in
terms of ideology, capital-intensity and societal interventions, but
argues that we need two additional features in order to better examine
the institutionalisation of liberal militarism and its relationship to
change: a focus on civil-military relations and the political-economic
foundations of warfare. The second step applies this framework to the
United States, arguing that liberal militarism is a military extension
of modernisation efforts of the Cold War and beyond, as part of a means
to liberalise societies: military power can be exercised both in terms
of actual war-fighting as a modernising practice, but also through the
adoption of US (and Western) 'best practices' and arms systems. Finally,
it looks [at [United States foreign policy]{.mark} in the present, in
terms of [the militarised dynamics of 'security]{.mark} assistance' [and
arms transfers,]{.mark} [arguing that these policies are part of a
promotion of a particular of neoliberal militarism to other]{.mark}
states and [societies]{.mark}. Overall a focus 'military modernisation'
as a part of liberal militarism rather than liberal war goes beyond the
focus on the violent proclivities of liberalism to see military power as
embedded in a broader political economy of war that also encompasses war
preparations]{.underline}. War, Liberalism and Historical Change: From
Liberal War to Liberal Militarism The paradoxes of liberal wars are well
established. Michael Howard (1981) prominently argued that despite the
importance that peace plays in liberal thought, liberal states are prone
to the over-moralisation of war, which has been detrimental to peace in
international relations. Core to liberal thought was not pacifism, but
an interest in solving the problems of war through war itself. Two sets
of critical literatures have picked up on this point with regard to
resonances with the concept developed here, they are broader and more
historically attuned to pre-1945 statedevelopment. Caverley's (2014)
analysis of 'democratic' militarism has a similar focus on political
economy -- making an important argument concerning democratic
**[publics' support of wars that have deferred costs -- but is less
interested in the broader ideological ends that war serves. 5 liberal
warfare today. First is a broadly historical materialist critique of
[the use of military power as a means of imposing economic imperatives
on other]{.mark} states and [societies. Here]{.mark} [war is seen as an
extension of capitalist imperialism,]{.mark} particularly in its current
neoliberal mode, and the focus is on opening up of new spaces of
accumulation]{.underline}** (Callinicos, 2003; Harvey, 2003) or
'pacifying' uncivilised spaces (Neocleous, 2014). The second critique
centres on the 'liberal way of war' that draws on Foucault's concepts of
governmentality and biopolitics (e.g. Foucault, 2004, 2007, 2008). [The
'liberal way of war' goes beyond mere violence or the institutions of
the military, as liberal states not only engage in a crusade through
militarised interventions abroad, but they also extend the power
relations of liberal societies globally]{.underline} (Dillon and Reid,
2009; Evans, 2010; Jabri, 2006). The 'liberal way of war' is about using
war as a technique of international biopower or governmentality, a means
to pacifying and constituting the liberal subject (Dillon and Reid,
2009; Evans, 2010; Gregory, 2011; Kienscherf, 2011; Shaw, 2013). Both
sets of arguments point to the contradiction at the heart of supposedly
peaceful liberal logics of governance: that of using war as a means to
make a 'liberal' peace. Following from the historical sociological view
given in the introduction, liberal war needs to be seen as a
historically contingent set of practices -- it cannot be generalised
across time and place (c.f. Chandler, 2010). Furthermore, despite giving
many insights, these two poles of the critical accounts neglect a
crucial element for the understanding of liberal war: the broader
institutions of warfare that reproduce and sustain it. While the Marxist
accounts are right to focus on structures of domination and spaces of
accumulation, they tend to see war as an extension of capitalism rather
than a structural and institutional phenomenon of liberal societies in
its own right (Balakrishnan, 2009); while the Foucaultian analysis of
liberal war over-emphasises the biopolitics of liberal governmentality
as expressed through warfare, and generalises and abstracts war as a
technique of power (Chandler, 2009). Foucault in fact highlights the
importance of the institutions of war, noting in his account of war as a
historical discourse the beginnings of a political-economic analysis of
society in early modern Europe: 6 it is war insofar as it is a way of
waging war, a way of preparing for and organizing war. War in the sense
of the distribution of weapons, the nature of weapons, fighting
techniques, the recruitment and payment of soldiers, the taxes earmarked
for the army; war as an internal institution, and not the raw event of a
battle (2004: 159-160). What Foucault adds is the way in which
military-political-economic organization precedes conquest, in that it
is not the winning of battles that determines what the conquest will
look like: 'it is not because it takes the form of an invasion that war
leaves its mark on the social body; it is because, through the
intermediary of military institutions, it has general effects on the
civil order as a whole' (2004:159). 4 If we add the organising feature
of military institutions, broadly conceived, as a link between war and
society, we can develop a broader analysis of war not just in terms of
the practices of war itself (the battles, the immediate and potential
looming violence), but also in the global structures that perpetuate and
enable war. Thus we can draw from the critical accounts the 'civilising'
and 'pacifying' elements of liberal warfare, but we must also note how
these are embedded in the institutions of militarism within the state
and projected globally. An analysis of militarism focuses on how
military power is institutionalised and reproduced within and outside of
liberal states. As noted in the introduction, militarism in general
relates to war both in terms of a disposition towards seeing military
power as useful for social goals as well as providing a legitimation for
broader social practices that enable war (see Mann, 1987). 'Liberal
militarism' can be seen as one type of militarism that developed in
liberal polities, a means of institutionalising military power in a
fashion that went along with liberal sensibilities embedded in a liberal
political economy of war. Edgerton (1991: 141; c.f. 2006) points to the
development of four aspects of liberal militarism in the British
context: an aversion to mass conscript armies; investment in technology
and professionalism to make up for the lack of 'manpower'; that
militaries are not just directed at enemies abroad, but also at civilian
populations and economic capacity (both 'home' and 'abroad'); and
'advances under the banner of its own universalist ideology and
conception of a world order'. The broad 4 See also his discussion of the
'deployment of a permanent military apparatus' in modern European
states, which has further similarities in terms of the analysis here
(Foucault, 2008: 305-306). Foucault was of course also critical of the
analysis of institutions in their own right (despite some ambiguity on
the subject), seeing the need for placing them in a broader context of
order-making (see e.g. 2008: 116-120). 7 framework of liberal militarism
-- capital, intervention, ideology -- gives us a sense of what is
specific to liberal states' approach to military power in the modern
era. However, it leaves out two contingent factors. 5 First is the
contingency of institutionalisation: the ways in which military power is
institutionalised within liberal states. Institutionalisation involves
both the positioning of the military and the normative invocation
legitimating (and reproducing) particular configurations of
civil-military relations. Huntington (1957; c.f. Lasswell, 1941) argued
that there are two core dimensions of civil-military relations: the
functional need for security, and the social and political imperatives
arising from broad contours within society. These two axes proved
crucial to debates in liberal states in terms of legitimating the role
of the military in politics and public life and the size of forces that
could be congruent with liberal life.6 The liberal attitude has tended
towards advocating a strict separation of the military from civil
affairs, especially from a political role. Essential to the liberal
conception of civil-military relations is its relationship to
professionalism, which is seen in Huntington's (1957) model of objective
civilian control: a professional core of officers deal with the majority
of military policy, but directly follow the orders of their civilian
masters. The important context to this argument was the future of
liberalism in an age of greater global security threats, which liberal
commentators framed in terms of a number of core problematics: liberal
states could easily side-line the military in times of peace, but what
would happen when security threats were more pressing and imminent?
Would the switch see a decline of 'objective control' and a move towards
a 'garrison state'? (e.g. Lasswell, 1941). The second contingency
relates to the political economy of war: how practices and preparations
for war distinctly emerge from political-economic relations. As Shaw
(1988) argues, war and militarism are separate from the logic of
capitalism, but feed off the productive capacities of states, and, as
such, war has to be seen as part of the totality of society. As he
describes it, 'we are talking about the role of socialised warfare in a
militarised economy and society' (Shaw, 1988: 24; c.f. Mann, 1993). Shaw
brings warfare into a broader 5 These link roughly to Shaw's two
determinants of militarism: the 'social forces mobilised in military
power', how armed actors mobilise resources and constituencies; and 'the
social relations of military power', the often conflictual relationship
between armed actors and civilians (Shaw, 2012). 6 For salient critiques
of the divide between liberal civil society and military, see: Frazer
and Hutchings, 2011; and Neocleous, 2014: chap. 3. 8 structural logic of
modern societies: it is not just parasitic on the mode of production, or
instrumental in the expansion of capital. We might better see it as a
link between modes of production and modes of destruction: shifting
forms of political economy, in terms of both the organisation of markets
and the dominant mode of production, help embed particular modes of
destruction. In liberal states, there is an emphasis on
capital-intensive forms of warfare (Edgerton, 2006), but one that is
further tempered in relation to dominant 'modes of warfare' (Kaldor,
1982b). These two contingencies indicate that problems of militarism and
militarisation are embedded in liberal states that are, contradictorily,
ideologically critical of the institutions of war. While always defining
itself against other, illiberal states, liberalism also has at its heart
a modernising and civilising logic. If illiberal states were atavistic
and war prone, liberal states would be beacons of civilization, and part
of a process of modernisation (Berghahn, 1984; Joas, 2003). The overall
paradox of liberal modernisation was that it brought with it its own
form of militarism, even as it was opposed to other 'militarised'
states. As Shaw (2012) has pointed out, here lies the real essence of
the problem of militarism: it has mainly been used as a pejorative term
to demonize the enemy. However, 'while the differences between
ideologies which glorify war and those which don't are significant,
glorifying and nonglorifying ideologies may equally justify war and
military power, and in this sense have the same core social function'
(Shaw, 2012: 20). As such, liberal militarism is distinguished both in
its particular arrangements for war preparations and how it legitimates
the use of force, but is still a form of militarism. While we need to
recognise potential differences within liberal states themselves in
terms of the pursuit of militarism (Joana and Mérand, 2014), the US as a
leading liberal state serves as an important example of the tendencies
of liberal militarism and its links to modernisation. The United States
and Liberal Military Modernity The development of the three aspects of
liberal militarism -- capital, intervention, ideology -- in the United
States have been the result of long term historical processes, giving a
long continuity to the US statebuilding project, but one that has also
been driven forward by 9 contingency. The early-Cold War period provided
an institutional stability to the historical tendencies of liberal
militarism, where it became clearly solidified as part of the US state,
and eventually folded into a modernising logic, that became part of US
'military modernity'. Political historian Richard Hofstadter once noted
that 'War has always been the Nemesis of the liberal tradition in
America' (Hofstadter, 1955: 272). This statement gets to the core of the
problem of war and militarism in US history, and the important place it
has had in US political life. While the view of the United States as a
monolithic liberal society has been challenged for many years by
analysts of American politics (Gerstle, 1994; Katznelson and Kalyvas,
2009; Smith, 1992; Wood, 2007), there is no doubt of liberalism's
importance in shaping the contours of politics, including military,
security and foreign policy. The founders were critical of the idea of
standing armies, peacetime conscription, and the concentration of
military power that could be used as a form of tyranny (Friedberg, 2000;
Krahmann, 2010). This was reflected in the lack of a substantial early
military force -- army or navy -- with the US instead relying on
militias and privateers to augment the small military forces that did
exist. The dedication to liberalism created a problem in regards to how
the US would reconcile liberalism with the instrumental use of military
power. As Huntington noted, war was seen in moral terms, so required an
extreme commitment: 'Since liberalism deprecates the moral validity of
the interests of state security, war must be either condemned as
incompatible with liberal goals or justified as an ideological movement
in support of those goals' (1957: 151). The ideological focus of
liberalism therefore fixated on the divide between the US actively
pursuing its liberal beliefs internationally and passively setting an
example. There has been much discussion of these two choices (e.g.
Desch, 2007/2008; Green, 2012; McCartney, 2004; Monten, 2005), but the
link to modernisation provides a fruitful reference point. While
modernisation is not usually clearly connected to militarism or
militarisation, it was core to the liberal project (e.g. Latham, 2011;
Westad, 2005), and connects to militarism through the exporting of
liberal styles of military preparedness to other states. There were two
core issues that the modernising logic raised with regard to militarism:
how the US could institutionally deal with threatening militarised
states and how to modernise other states. 10 The first concerned the
relationship between the US and other powerful states which were
illiberal: the issue here was whether military policies could be
developed that would defy the challenge of strong states without liberal
states succumbing to militarism themselves. By World War II, militarism
had mainly become associated with the totalitarian states of the
interwar period, and liberalism became an ideology based on the
opposition to totalitarianism (Bell, 2014). Liberal democracies were
opposed to militarised values, especially the combination of
'collectivism' and the domination of the state and politics by the
military (Vagts, 1959; c.f. Friedberg, 2000). However, there was great
concern that the need to combat and secure the liberal state against
totalitarianism could lead to liberal states becoming militarised
themselves, transforming into 'garrison states' predominated by military
planners (Lasswell, 1941; c.f. Gleason, 1995: chap. 3); or, conversely,
that liberal states would not be able to make the ideological
compromises necessary to defend themselves (Huntington, 1957). The focus
on the scale and scope of the state and its potential for internal and
external intervention became crucial for the institutionalisation of
military power (i.e. in terms of civilmilitary relations): achieving the
appropriate balance between war preparation, military power and
liberalism was necessary for the maintenance of security at home and
from threatening states abroad. The shifting focus of liberalism to
become, in essence, the opposite of totalitarianism brought clarity to
both what was seen as threatening to the US and what the response would
need to be. While the causes of the Cold War national security state
have been endlessly debated (e.g. Friedberg, 2000; Hogan, 1998; Sherry,
1995), what is important is that it institutionalised the new dynamics
of liberal militarism in the state. The national security state not only
prioritised peacetime military mobilization in a way that was impossible
previously, it embedded this in a series of organizational changes that
pushed national security to the forefront of US political life: military
professionalism was maintained, with increases in defence spending
focusing on research and design and capital development via the private
sector, but also requiring a larger ideological commitment to
anti-communism (Hogan, 1998; Hooks and McLauchlan, 1992; Sherry, 1995;
Waddell, 2001). The second issue concerned the potential to spread
modernity more broadly, especially to less powerful states that were
considered to be in need of 'civilising'. In terms of external 11
modernisation and anti-militarism, it is clear that policymakers often
folded modernisation into a broad sense of national security: that
postcolonial states (and other allies) that followed the US path to
development would both be better off, and also form a more peaceful part
of the international system (Latham, 2011; Ekbladh, 2010; c.f. Duffield,
2005). Developing states would be modernised in order for them to avoid
authoritarianism, and therefore become less militarised, and also
ideological allies of the United States. However, liberal militarism was
also integral to modernisation, as [the US encouraged modernising states
to develop military power in line with the US: focusing on
capital-intensive militarisation with the US providing military aid
through training and arms transfers]{.underline} (Kinsella, 2012: 110;
Wendt and Barnett, 1993). Overall, [a key part of US liberal militarism
was not just a way of organising military power at home, but a
'militarism of the globe']{.underline} (Mann, 1996) that attempted to
embed military power across the international system in a fashion that
reflected US liberal militarism, as well as through the deployment of US
military presence throughout the world. As such, an early approach to
the modernising process focused not just on the modernity inherent in
industrialisation, but the values of liberal versions of civil-military
relations (see Berghahn, 1984: chap. 4), especially in relation to the
'Third World'. Furthermore, US liberal militarism was embedded globally
through a broader political economy of militarism that used arms
production and transfers, not only as political tools, but as ways of
expanding and reproducing a particular global military order (Kaldor,
1982a; Stavrianakis, 2010). The interventionary aspect of modernisation
and militarism became a crucial part of the Cold War, both domestically
and internationally, effectively blurring the lines between these
divisions. While the interventionary actions were seen both in military
interventions themselves (covert and otherwise) and broader
international economic policy, they were also fashioned in terms of
'modernisation'. As NSC 52/3 noted: recognizing, however, that we do not
have the resources unilaterally to defend, direct and support the entire
non-Communist world, we are also assisting and encouraging those nations
that are willing and able to contribute towards the same results we deem
essential, to increase their political and economic stability and their
military capabilities (National Security Council, 1949: 386- 387). 12
This description also links with 'Point Four' of President Truman's
Address to Congress on January 20, 1949 (Ekbladh, 2010: chap. 3; Latham,
2011). Point Four generated attention to the problems of external state
development as part of the overall national security: if developing
states could be brought along the modernising path of the United States,
they would be more likely to be peaceful members of the international
community. That a US ideology of modernisation co-existed with an
increasingly popular Soviet model of modernisation -- focused on rapid
industrialisation -- was also crucial (Westad, 2005). While more
attention has been paid to Point Four as being influential for US
developmental policy in the Cold War, it also went hand in hand with the
broader goals of US liberal militarism as a modernising project. While
early phases were mainly seen in terms of providing funding and
incentives (and expertise) for post-colonial states to develop along the
lines of the US, the relative failure of these early attempts (at least
in terms of US policymakers getting their own desired outcomes) led to a
more coercive focus to modernisation, especially in the Vietnam War
(Ekbladh, 2010; Latham, 2011). The focus on modernisation in the Cold
War was Keynesian in its outlook: it was part of creating a global 'new
deal' that could foster sustained economic growth and the instantiation
of strong market relations through a 'top down' approach focused on
large-scale social engineering (Gilman, 2003; Latham, 2011).
**[[Where]{.mark} [US policymakers failed was in the imposition
of]{.mark} these [features on states which were more committed to
industrial independence:]{.mark} in India for example, there was much
more of an interest in the Soviet model of modernisation that focused on
rapid indigenous industrialisation as a way of 'catching
up']{.underline}**. In military terms, two versions dominated. The first
was modernisation through military intervention, where intervention
itself provided a means to modernise states and society. The second saw
an intersection of strategic purpose and the spread of liberal ideas
about military practice and organisation, through training and arms
transfers. While modernisation theory in its top-down Keynesian version
fell out of favour in the 1970s and 1980s as it was overtaken by the
'Washington consensus' of neoliberal development policy (Kiely, 2007),
its broader ideological legacy remained, and carried on into the
post-9/11 era of military intervention and state-building. The focus in
statebuilding was much more predicated on the development of 13 'good
governance' that would promote a flourishing economy (rather than large
top-down programmes of the modernization in its heyday). Here we again
see the promotion of military modernisation through direct military
intervention (as in Iraq and Afghanistan) and through arms transfers and
security assistance, but now focused on neoliberal ideas: now the state
only minimally needs to set a context for bottom-up market-based
programmes and allowing the private sector to flourish (Ekbladh, 2011).
Neoliberal militarism therefore is still capitalintensive, but more
reliant on the private sector to innovate and provide logistical support
(e.g. Erbel and Kinsey, 2016; Joana and Mérand, 2014; MacLeavy and
Peoples, 2009); neoliberal military modernisation is the
internationalisation of these ideas. Liberal Militarism and
Modernisation Post-9/11 While the United States struggled in the 1990s
to find a coherent and broadly accepted rationale to support its
national security state, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
reinvigorated the sense of purpose, refashioned against global terrorism
(Jackson, 2011). President Bush captured the purpose in a Manichean
worldview that mimicked the apocalyptic tones of the early Cold War
(Bush, 2001; c.f. White House, 2002). However, what was core was a sense
of the United States at the forefront of a moral, civilizational mission
that necessitated a war on terror, as claimed by President Bush in his
September 2001 speech to Congress (Bush, 2001): the invocation of Nazism
and totalitarianism in the speech also gave echoes of the earlier
debates about liberalism and freedom. While the Bush Administration
eventually dropped the rhetoric of a 'war' on terror -- as seen in the
more measured tone of the 2006 National Security Strategy (White House,
2006) -- the ideology of security remained, one calling for US
leadership against transnational terrorism, expressing an increased
sense of risk in the world, with a need for US military intervention to
stop it. The Obama Administration in the main dispensed with the
divisive rhetoric of the war on terror (e.g. Obama, 2009b) while also
scaling down the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, but retained much
of the same counter-terrorism policy (Jackson, 2011; McCrisken, 2011).
As such, this was not a move away from war, as demonstrated by President
Obama's Nobel Peace Prize speech (2009a) that emphasised the need for a
'just war' in certain circumstances, 14 seemingly backing up the
counter-terrorism polices of his predecessor through a moralizing take
on the use of military force. As such, the rhetoric of perpetual
insecurity plays a crucial role in framing liberal war, especially in
terms of the necessity of intervening in illiberal spaces as a means to
fostering liberal identity and affirming US responsibility and
exceptionalism. The emphasising of a civilizational narrative in US
foreign policy brought a renewed focus on liberal modernisation.
However, while the broad contours of liberal militarism were still
present, the major shifts in geopolitics and the global political
economy made the organizational imperatives of the shift towards a
neoliberal dynamic (Harvey, 2005). The critical literature on liberal
war is situated in this context, focusing on either the ways in which
war was used to pacify new spaces of accumulation or as a technique of
biopolitics and governmentality. However, we can additionally critically
analyse the role of military interventions as part of reconstructing
society in terms of what militaries themselves do. As Gilbert (2015:
203) has argued, 'militaries are productive of markets, in times of war
and peace, and gain influence through their commissioning and
contracting'. Gilbert traces this idea through several core programmes
the US military utilised in both Iraq and Afghanistan, primarily the
Commanders' Emergency Response Programme (CERP) and the Task Force on
Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO). The former enabled commanders
to distribute money to small development-related projects with little
oversight, and the latter forged links between US businesses and the
private sector, as a means to rebuilding the economies of Iraq and
Afghanistan through private enterprise. What is of great interest in
terms of thinking about neoliberal militarism as a form of modernisation
is the ways in which these programmes were clearly in line with
implementing bottom-up policies aimed at neoliberal marketization. While
they do not go as far as some commentators would have liked, they
clearly do form a part of what Schramm positively described as
'expeditionary economics'. As Schramm notes, 'The United States' armed
forces are uniquely positioned to contribute to world peace and
prosperity by means other than actual force' (Schramm, 2010: 99). While
Gilbert is more interested in how money becomes an actual 'weapon' of
the US military (and despite the changing policy focus of the Obama 15
Administration, away from stability operations, the new doctrines remain
fairly firmly embedded in military thinking), we can connect this more
broadly to the interface between military power and economic power: not
just in terms of how military interventions foster modernisation, but
how exporting liberal models of military preparedness provide the
background conditions for and institutionalisation of liberal
militarism. As noted at the outset, liberal militarism here refers to a
specifically liberal way of legitimating war and its preparations as
socially useful, but fashioned in liberal terms. 'Security Assistance'
and Arms Transfers [As a sector in which the US has a distinct advantage
(economically and technologically), it is not surprising that there is a
distinct confluence of interests in what is referred to as 'Security
Assistance', which runs the gamut of activities to do with military
training and arms transfers.]{.underline} Barkawi (2011) has referred to
the military-to-military contacts as a form of 'defence diplomacy', a
set of often asymmetrical relations that encourage US partners and
allies to take up the burden of US security interests in various
regions. The provision of training and transfer of arms is usually put
in the context of geopolitics: that the US supplies arms to its allies
and to states that it wants to form better relationships with. This was
a common trope of the Cold War and is still the dominant frame for
reading arms export policies. However, while this aspect is of course
important, there is a broader set of processes involved, in relation to
how **[[arms transfers]{.mark} and production arrangements [are part of
a modernisation strategy.]{.mark} First and foremost, [arms transfers
are a means of modernising the militaries of states and especially
developing states:]{.mark} in the context of US arms exports, this can
be seen as part of liberal militarism in the sense that it focuses on
military capacity in terms of capital-intensity that is also explicitly
linked to US technology.]{.underline}** While never a relationship of
equality [-- in many cases North-South transfers created a form of
dependency]{.underline} (Wendt and Barnett, 1993) [-- the transfer of US
produced weapons is part of a broader political strategy of the US, and
also often lines up with a broader liberal logic of what it means to
have a modern military: that capital-intensity is crucial]{.underline}
(Wendt and Barnett, 1993) [and that civil-military relations should be
shaped by 'objective control'.]{.underline} This was clear in the Cold
War, where weapons and training 16 were often part of an effort to
ensure allied states were not only playing on a the same field as the
'enemies' of the US, but that their militaries had a status that could
effectively combat Soviet Communism. The post-Cold War era changed this
picture somewhat. As direct geo-political threats to US interests
receded, arms transfers were put in the context of business
relationships rather than geopolitics. International arms sales
increased during the Clinton Administration, at least partially for
economic reasons: shoring up US defence industries that would be certain
to see a decline in domestic sales (Wirls, 2013: 66-67). The new
security challenge was maintaining a robust defence industrial base in
an era of globalization (Wirls, 2013; c.f. MacLeavy and Peoples, 2009).
While the increased concentration of defence firms in the US led to four
main firms which had a narrow focus on defence-related products, there
was a diversification of both supply chains and the use of off-the-shelf
technologies from the civilian sector which could be used in defence
manufacturing. The Cold War era 'spin offs' from the defence industry
had been transformed into more integration, a process of 'spinning in'
technologies from the civilian sector (Dunne and Surry, 2006).
Post-9/11, while the security focus became more prominent, the
commercial aspects of arms transfers were still pronounced, as can be
seen in the volume of US arms transfers. In the Bush and Obama era, the
US retained its leading role in the international arms industry,
accounting for 30% of all sales in 2004-2008, and 29% in 2009-2013
(followed closest by Russia at 24% and 27% respectively) (Wezeman and
Wezeman, 2014), with an 11% increase between the two periods. The US has
retained an impressively diverse range of recipients, amounting to at
least 90, and the top recipient, Australia, accounting for a 10% share
(compared with Russia's 52 recipients, with half going to China, India
and Algeria) (Wezeman and Wezeman, 2014). As can be seen in the various
statements from the Obama Administration concerning security assistance,
it is not just important for achieving specific national security goals
of the United States, but also in fostering partners to maintain a
military edge over collective rivals, to encourage interoperability of
equipment, and for persuading partner countries to develop indigenous
capacities to defend themselves (US Department of Defense, 2014; White
House, 2013, 2014). But the core objective is for partner countries --
whether in the North or South -- 17 to be in line with US security
goals. [This can be seen clearly in US arms transfer policy: 'United
States conventional arms transfer policy supports transfers that meet
legitimate security requirements of our allies and partners in support
of our national security and foreign policy interests']{.underline}
(White House, 2014). [While the focus on modernisation is not nearly as
pronounced as it was in the Cold War, arms sales are still caught up in
a modernising logic:]{.underline} **[while the core emphases in policy
statements about arms transfers (and security assistance more generally)
stress burden-sharing and common security goals, broader goals related
to military modernisation are still apparent]{.underline}**. For
example, one of the goals stated as part of the Presidential Policy
Directive 23, dealing with Security Sector Assistance, is to 'promote
universal values, such as good governance' (White House, 2013), also
expressed in a policy goal: 'pursuit of security sector reform as part
of a broader, long term effort to improve governance and promote
sustainable economic development.' Such commitments are also reflected
in a later directive specifically dealing with arms transfer policy,
where a core goal is 'promoting the acquisition of U.S. systems to
increase interoperability with allies and partners, lower the unit costs
for all, and strengthen the industrial base' (White House, 2014). These
goals need to be seen in a broad fashion, in that security can be
achieved by allies becoming more like the US, which can be actualised
through the diffusion of neoliberal militarism.7 The desire to maintain
a modernising presence can be seen in US policy towards AsiaPacific. As
part of its 'pivot' to Asia-Pacific, expressed in the 2012 Defense
Strategic Guidance (US Department of Defense, 2012), also occurring in a
time of increasing austerity and increasing interdependence (with
threats also transnationalised), the Obama Administration stressed the
need to rely on regional allies, especially through training and
modernisation programmes. The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (US
Department of Defense, 2014) emphasised this in its second 'pillar' of
defence strategy, 'building security globally', which stressed the need
to build up the capacity of partners, to ensure interoperability and the
ability of partner states to work together to achieve common goals. 7 A
good example of this in the North can be found in the politics of the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (for an overview, see Vucetic and Nossal,
2012-13; for a detailed case on the US and Norway, see Vucetic and
Rydberg, 2015). 18 While the usual alliances are emphasised in terms of
Asia-Pacific (Australia, Japan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand
-- and some new partnerships to build upon with Vietnam, Malaysia and
Singapore), one of the most interesting is the new approach towards
India. As announced in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance document, the
US was to take up a new strategic partnership with India as part of its
focus on Asia-Pacific (US Department of Defense, 2012: 2). A crucial
part of this growing cooperative arrangement has been a focus on arms
industry relationships: in 2015, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi
jointly announced a commitment to a new mechanism of cooperation (as
part of a broader 'statement of friendship'): the Defense Technology
Trade Initiative (DTTI) (White House, 2015). The purpose of the DTTI is
not only to form a stronger geostrategic partnership, but to also
strengthen India's defence industrial base and promote increasing
business ties between defence industries. These efforts go beyond just
an interest in security or economic prosperity; as Undersecretary for
Defense Frank Kendall put it, our hope is that these efforts will begin
a process of continued growth over time, until India and the U.S.
achieve a strong and enduring partnership in military modernisation,
technology, and manufacturing --- because a strong Indian military
serving as a security provider both regionally and throughout the globe
is in the mutual interest of both our countries (Kendall, 2015). What is
of great interest in terms of DTTI is the shift in US-Indian relations,
and the diversification of the source of Indian arms. Long pursuing a
foreign policy of nonalignment (and hampered by US trade sanctions),
India had acquired the vast majority of its arms (and its developmental
model) from the Soviet Union and then Russia. Despite some scepticism
about the new arrangement (especially in terms of whether the US can
overtake Russia as a main supplier of arms to India) (Raghuvanshi,
2015), the Modi government's switch to improving their own defence
industrial base is a crucial aspect, that chimes more broadly with US
modernisation efforts. India currently imports 70% of its defence
technology (mainly from Russia), and is currently the largest
international importer of major arms (Shah, 2015; Wezeman and Wezeman,
2015). Under Modi, India is developing its defence industrial base
through an indigenous production programme called 'Make in India', and
here US support is really essential, especially through co-production
projects, which will also eventually involve 19 technology transfer
(Carter, 2013; Kendall, 2015; c.f. Lubold, 2015; Shah, 2015). As defence
commentator Ashley Tellis put it: 'I think there is a clear strategic
judgement in India that important though Russia still is for India,
Moscow represents the past, Washington represents the future' (cited in:
Raghuvanshi, 2015). As the relationship is still in its early stages, it
is best to see it as a potential case of US-centric military
modernisation, rather than a complete success.8 Another key area of
military modernisation through security assistance is to provide direct
training and assistance to partner states. A number of programmes led by
the Department of State (DoS) and Department of Defense (DoD) have been
inaugurated to provide 'capacity building' as part of security
assistance. While the DoS has traditionally taken the lead on such
matters, an increasing amount of security assistance is being provided
through the DoD, especially through the specialist Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) (Pincus, 2008). The DSCA is now in charge of
running core programmes (though with the initial input of DoS) such as
'Global Train and Equip', 'Foreign Military Sales' (FMS), 'Foreign
Military Financing' (FMF), and 'International Military Education and
Training' (IMET). All of these programmes are designed in various ways
to provide US equipment and training for 'friendly states' that build
capacity and allow for interoperability. Training courses link to key
goals such as 'Military Professionalization', 'Interoperability with US
& Coalition Forces', 'Strategic Bilateral and Regional Relations',
'Institutional and Security Sector Reform' and 'Border Security and
Transnational Threats' (US Departments of Defense and State, 2014). The
importance of these programmes goes beyond the obvious benefits for the
US -- to the security environment, for interoperability and for the US
defence industrial base -- as these are often seen in tandem with a
broader goal of security assistance, that capacity building leads to
'good governance'. As Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Gregory M.
Kausner (2013) put it, 'in Foreign Military Sales we often talk of a
"total package approach" -- but the package needs to be greater than a
weapons system; it needs to involve, according to the situation,
everything from institutional reform to legal reform to professional
education'. There is a synergy between broad US foreign policy goals and
shaping partner states to have modernised military 8 On potential
obstacles to US moves into the Indian defence market, see: Vucetic and
Duarte (2015). 20 capabilities. The security cooperation fostered
through such links goes beyond just alliances to broad modernisation
strategies based on military capabilities: 'capacity-building' promotes
capital-intensive warfare, liberal civil-military relations and the
promotion of a marketised defence economy. As such, 'security
assistance' concerns the spread of liberal militarism itself, promoting
an ideology of neoliberalism around military preparation. Conclusion The
study of liberalism and war is important. While much has been done in
recent years to better understand the dynamics of liberal states
fighting wars, more emphasis needs to be placed on understanding the
societal dynamics of military power. Such dynamics are especially
important in terms of the long-term historical institutionalisation of
liberalism as a guiding ideology, and its broader, contingent effects on
the organisation and practices of military power. While the critical
literature on liberalism and war has come to provide an important
reference point for understanding war today, it tends to overly focus on
the structural aspects of liberal war, underplaying both the long term
historical trajectories of liberalism in liberal societies and the
specific institutionalisation of military power in relation to both
liberalism and political economy. The article has argued that 'liberal
militarism' is an important way of understanding the relationship
between liberalism and military power, by embedding liberalism in the
social and political institutions of military power in liberal states,
especially examining the linkages between war, security and political
economy. The case of the United States demonstrates the effectiveness of
such analysis, by establishing that the link between liberalism and
military practices has continuities shaped not only by the centrality of
liberalism to US political life, but also to the particularities of the
institutionalisation of liberal militarism in the early-Cold War period.
Liberal militarism is one manifestation of militarism that developed in
the early Cold War, highlighting liberalism's tendency to turn wars into
moral crusades, but also embedding preparations for war in the dynamics
of liberal political economy (especially that of modernisation), leading
to the prevalence of both capitalintensive warfare and the predominance
of the private sector in producing for war. 21 The United States, as
both a leading liberal state and preeminent military power, was utilised
as a core case of the usefulness of liberal militarism as a concept.
Liberal militarism frames the institutionalisation of military power in
the US, giving an overall direction to how militarism manifests in the
US as a liberal state. However, as argued, the particularity of US
liberal militarism is also related to its instantiation in a pattern of
civil-military relations and in the dominant mode of warfare. The Cold
War inaugurated a shift for the US, where permanent preparedness in an
industrialised war economy was paramount, and the institutionalisation
of militarism in the US state was modified to fit these new parameters.
Civil-military relations were still shaped by professionalism, enhanced
by an approach to capital-intensive warfare that was led by the state,
but still in the hands of private industry. Overall, the ideology of US
liberalism has been entwined with liberal modernisation, and this became
a hallmark of US policy in the Cold War period, and became a part of
liberal militarism in terms of promoting a military modernity to its
allies and other post-colonial states as a means of both control and
development. While this military modernisation did have a coercive edge
(as seen in the Vietnam War) it also relied on other techniques, such as
military training and arms transfers. In the post-Cold War period, the
modernisation associated with US development programmes at their height
-- in the 1960s -- had already been abandoned in favour of neoliberal
development, which eschewed large top-down planning in favour of
promoting 'good governance' in the form of a reduced state role in the
economy and increasing free trade and privatisation. While this was a
direct rebuff to the liberal modernisers of the 1960s, it was still in
the broadest sense an attempt at improvement through intervention -- but
a belief in the power of markets rather than in social engineering. This
manifested itself in a change in military modernisation: while the US
would intervene militarily to state-build these would be premised on
promoting a new market society, rather than a strong state. The article
argued that this could also be seen in the realm of security assistance,
which included military training and arms transfer programmes. While
partially about finding security through providing allies with adequate
resources, security assistance also concerns setting up a 'modernised'
global military order, where like-minded states not only share US
security 22 concerns, but also share them because their goals are the
same. Further research needs to be done to analyse variation within
modes of militarism, as the US is in many ways a special case due to its
hegemonic position in the international system (see Joana and Mérand,
2014). However, a focus on liberal militarism rather than liberal war
broadens out the critical analysis of present day military practices, by
focusing on their long-term institutionalisation, while also further
demonstrating that war is not just about battles and violent
intervention, but about the instantiation of a political economy of war
in the everyday structures of states and societies.

[Building off ideas that African Americans are internally colonized
within the United States]{.underline}, but eschewing land as the sign of
difference between classic and internal colonialism, bell hooks writes
that "[[even though African Americans in the United States had no
country]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[whites took over and colonized]{.mark};
[as a structure of domination]{.mark} that is defined as ownership of a
people by another]{.underline}, [colonialism aptly describes the process
by which [blacks]{.mark} were and [continue to be subordinated by white
supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}."⁴⁵ [[By identifying slavery as the
original sin]{.mark} of the United States' colonialist
project]{.underline}, [bell [hooks is able to foreground how racism
continues to perpetuate the]{.mark} economic, social, and political
[oppressions African Americans face every day]{.mark} within the United
States]{.underline}, [[but in the process she perpetuates the
colonialist narratives]{.mark} [that deny that the land ever belonged to
anyone prior]{.mark} to the United States.]{.underline} Over the last
thirty years, theories of internal colonialism shifted from locating it
first as an analysis of the economic processes that necessitated the
maintenance of ethnic difference to a primarily racialized analysis of
how economic, social, and political inequalities came to be naturalized.
To come at this another way, "internal colonialism" was initially
operationalized in Europe to describe the economic disparities that
serve to make ethnic identities within a nation-state matter. Within
U.S. critical race studies, "internal colonialism" describes how racial
and ethnic identities create economic and political disparities and in
the process racism becomes homologous to U.S. colonialism in North
America. [It is this shift that allows bell hooks to write: Just as many
white Americans deny both the prevalence of racism in the United States
and the role they play in perpetuating and maintaining white supremacy,
non-white, non-black groups, Native, Asian, Hispanic Americans, all deny
[their investment in anti-black sentiment even as they consistently seek
to distance themselves from blackness]{.mark} so that they will not be
seen as residing at the bottom of this society's totem pole, in the
category reserved for the most despised group]{.underline}.⁴⁶
["[Native]{.mark}" here [is grouped]{.mark} with "Asian" [and]{.mark}
"Hispanic" Americans, and through the enjambment American Indians are
[made newcomers in hooks's racial paradigms that create a white/black
binary]{.mark} in the United States.]{.underline} As Aileen
Moreton-Robinson has shown [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} her [[critique of
whiteness studies]{.mark}, "[blackness becomes an epistemological
possession]{.mark} . . . [which forecloses the possibility that the
dispossession]{.mark} of Native Americans [was tied to migration and the
establishment of slavery]{.mark} driven by the logics of
capital]{.underline}."⁴⁷ Ironically, [[hooks's framings of white/black
paradigms refract a similar foreclosure with regards to indigenous
dispossession]{.underline}]{.mark}. But certainly, in the case of the
Southeastern Indian nations and their continued disenfranchisement and
oppression of Freedmen, those indigenous nations have denied their
investment in the logics of capital underscoring slavery and in
anti-black racism. Often, this denial evolves out of fears that
blackness will somehow undermine indigenous claims of sovereignty and
authenticity and will allow further U.S. encroachments on land, culture,
and identity. However, indigenous dispossession is foreclosed for hooks,
given that her metaphor for understanding the hierarchies of oppression
in the U.S. is projected on top of a stereotypical reference to "totem
pole," which in indigenous worlds is neither hierarchical nor
oppressive. [It is this turn that finally allows hooks to reposition
African American bodies as the foundational site of colonization rather
than American Indian lands.]{.underline}

### Binaries (IR)

#### The aff is rooted in the alterities established from the "discovery of the new world" which contemplates international relations creating the ideals of modernity and continues to reproduce them through the aff establishing dichotomies and binaries. This leads to the invisibility of coloniality today.

absence' and silence that 'is constitutive of the very idea of modernity
and its use in sociological interpretations of the contemporary
world'.18 These discussions about the 'absences' in the narrative of
International Relations have opened up space in order to reimagine the
field of International Relations. Amitav Acharya, for example,
approaches the 'non-Western'19 and/or 'post-western' endeavours 'as part
of a broader challenge of reimagining IR as a global discipline'.20 This
reimagining encapsulates a pluralistic universalism that recognises and
respects diversity, is premised upon world history, encompasses existing
approaches, includes area studies, abandons exceptionalism and
recognises multiple facets of agency.21 Even though the \'non-West\' is
a 'perilous but unavoidable terrain',22 how this terrain is navigated
needs to be mindful of the spatial and temporal alterities that produce
and sustain Eurocentrism as a mode of knowledge. [[Eurocentrism is a
mode of knowledge and a paradigm for 'interpreting
a]{.underline}]{.mark} (past, present and future) [[reality that]{.mark}
uncritically [established]{.mark} the idea of [European and Western
historical progress]{.mark}/achievement [and]{.mark} its political and
ethical [superiority']{.mark}]{.underline}.23 As such, what makes
Eurocentrism possible [[and enables]{.mark} it [to continue being
reproduced in narratives of international relations is its]{.mark}
re-articulation[, reproduction and re-enactment through the colonial
matrix of power]{.mark} that is ['maintained alive in books, in]{.mark}
the criteria for [academic performance, in cultural
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline}'.24 [[International Relations as a
discipline defines political time]{.underline}]{.mark}25 [[and
space]{.underline}]{.mark}26 [[through the Western conceptions of
modernity]{.underline}]{.mark}.27 [[International Relations is
constituted upon spatial and temporal differences]{.mark} that were
[constituted by the 'discovery' of the 'New World', and]{.mark}
continues to [define time and space through]{.mark} these [binaries and
dichotomies]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 The alterity that was established
with the 'discovery' established a 'geo-cultural division of knowledge
production' both spatially and temporally. [[These differences and
binary oppositions posit the West in a 'flexible positional
superiority']{.underline}]{.mark}29 [[of being the knower, of being
human, of being civilised.]{.underline}]{.mark} What is written for the
'others' is always a story of a lack and a story of catching up.30 It is
this 'geo-cultural division of knowledge production'31 established with
the 'discovery' that constitutes the 'philosophical foundation for the
totalizing, cultural, political, economic, and legal systems of
knowledge that have sustained Western hegemony'.32 [[This system]{.mark}
of knowledge [is maintained through the]{.mark} continued designation of
['difference' within the geo-political]{.mark} and geo-cultural
[organisation of world politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether it is
civilised/barbarian, modern/ traditional, advanced/backward. [[The field
of I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations [is predicated upon]{.mark}
these [constitutive alterities and]{.mark} continues to [reproduce
them]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 As such, [[the Eurocentrism of
I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations is [rooted in]{.mark} the
[alterities established with the 'discovery' of the 'New
World']{.mark}]{.underline}, and to understand Eurocentrism 'in terms of
the way in which certain patterns of interpretation are produced and
contested',34 **[[it is important to question the coloniality of
International Relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Coloniality and the
colonial matrix of power are concepts put forward by the Peruvian
sociologist Anibal Quijano35 and have been elaborated and expanded upon
by Walter Mignolo36 ('colonial difference'), Ramon Grosfoguel37
(heterarchies); Nelson MaldonadoTorres38 (coloniality of being) and
Maria Lugones39 (coloniality of gender). [[Coloniality is a re-reading
of]{.mark} the story of [modernity.]{.mark}]{.underline} According to
this perspective, [modernity is a European narrative [and coloniality is
the darker side of that narrative. The conceptual framework thus should
not be 'modernity' but rather
'modernity/coloniality']{.mark}]{.underline}, whereby coloniality is
constitutive of modernity and should not be thought of separately.40 The
perspective also underscores that even though 'colonialism' might have
ended and decolonisation succeeded in the sense of juridico-political
independence, complete 'decolonisation' has not been achieved.
Grosfoguel calls this the 'mythology of the 'decolonizazion of the
world' [[which 'contributes to the invisibility of 'coloniality'
today']{.underline}]{.mark}.41 As such, coloniality as 'modality of
being as well as ... power relations that sustain a fundamental social
and political divide' did not end with the achievement of
juridico-political independence 'but was rearticulated in terms of the
post-World War II imaginary of three worlds (which in turn replaced the
previous articulations in terms of Occidentalism and Orientalism'.42

#### The aff recreates a west/non-west binary due to the struggle to overcome IR, implying rigid identities, borders, and labels which need to be questioned and opened up for the possibility for multiple knowledges

[[One of the most pervasive binaries that is reproduced in
I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations [is the West/non-West
differentiation. It is the search for an 'alternative' non-West that
also continues to reproduce the power of the West.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Ngũgĩ wa Tiongh'o, in questioning the nature of 'African Literature',
asks a pertinent question: Was it literature about Africa or about the
African experience? Was it literature written by Africans? What about a
non-African who wrote about Africa: did his work qualify as African
literature? What if an African set his work in Greenland: did that
qualify as African literature? Or were African languages the criteria?
OK: what about Arabic, was it not foreign to Africa? What about French
and English, which had become African, languages? What if an European
wrote about Europe in an African language? If ... if ... if ...?75 The
nature of this questioning is pertinent for the discussion about the
field and the questions we ask of it. What is Non-Western International
Relations theory? Is it theory about the non-Western experience? Is it
theory from non-Westerners? Is it theory about the non-West from the
West or theory written by someone from the West about the non-West?
[[The different possible formulations and qualifications of the question
lead us to different answers that culminate in the problematic
reproduction of a West/non-West binary.]{.underline}]{.mark}76 [[The
struggle to overcome the Eurocentrism of IR rests on a continued
reproduction of the West/non-West binary.]{.underline}]{.mark} The way
in which International Relations can be written without succumbing to
reproducing these binaries remains one of the main issues in
'decolonising' International Relations. There is no one way or road map
that should be followed, but rather what this section aimed to underline
is the necessity to continuously question the binaries that creep into
our discussions of International Relations. In that sense, different
potentialities and possibilities need to be explored. For example,
Himadeep Muppidi in narrating the story of Telagana focuses on India and
Andhra Pradesh, and in doing so works through a 'field of significance'
that is not 'only of the West'.77 Robbie Shilliam breaks through the
cartographic gaze and focuses on redeeming 'the possibilities of
anti-colonial solidarity between colonial and (post)colonial peoples on
terms other than those laid out by colonial science'78 through
'cultivating knowledge of deep relations' which is 'relationality that
exists underneath the wounds of coloniality' and aims to bind 'back
together peoples, lands, pasts, ancestors and spirits'79 and research
'sideways' rather than through the Eurocentric gaze. [[The understanding
of the field of I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations [is permeated
with rigid identities, clearly identifiable borders and imposed
labels.]{.mark} [It is these that have to be questioned, re-thought of
and opened up in order to have the possibility for multiple knowledges
and 'decolonise' International Relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Coalitions

#### The AFF's equivocation of oppressions is a colonial move designed to absolve one's self of complicity with settlerism---the logical endpoint of the AFF is redistribution of oppression

A more nuanced move to innocence is the [[homogenizing]{.mark} of
various [experiences of oppression]{.mark}]{.underline} as colonization.
Calling different groups 'colonized' without describing their
relationship to settler colonialism is an equivocation, "the fallacy of
using a word in different senses at different stages of the reasoning\"
(Etymonline, 2001). In particular, describing all struggles against
imperialism as 'decolonizing' [[creates]{.mark} a convenient [ambiguity
between decolonization and social justice]{.mark}]{.underline} work,
especially [[among]{.mark} people of color]{.underline}, queer people,
[and other [groups minoritized by the settler]{.mark}
nation-[state]{.mark}]{.underline}. '[[We are all
colonized]{.underline}]{.mark},' [may be]{.underline} a
[true]{.underline} statement [but]{.underline} is deceptively embracive
and vague, [its [inference]{.mark}]{.underline}: '[[None of us are
settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}.' **[[Equivocation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or calling everything by the same name, **[[is a move towards innocence
that is]{.underline}]{.mark}** especially **[[vogue in coalition
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** among people of color. [[People of
color]{.mark} who]{.underline} enter/[are brought into the]{.underline}
settler colonial [nation-state]{.underline} also [[enter the triad
of]{.mark} relations between [settler-native-slave]{.mark}]{.underline}.
We are referring here to the colonial pathways that are usually
described as 'immigration' and how [the]{.underline}
refugee/immigrant/[migrant is invited to be a settler]{.underline} in
some scenarios, given the appropriate investments in whiteness, or is
made an illegal, criminal presence in other scenarios. [[Ghetto
colonialism, prisons, and under resourced]{.underline}]{.mark}
compulsory [[schooling are specializations of settler
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark} in North America; they are [produced
by]{.underline} the [collapsing]{.underline} of [internal, external, and
settler colonialisms]{.underline}, into new blended categories15. This
triad of settler-native-slave and its selective collapsibility seems to
be unique to settler colonial nations. For example, all Aleut people on
the Aleutian Islands were collected and placed in internment camps for
four years after the bombing of Dutch Harbor; the stated rationale was
the protection of the people but another likely reason was that the U.S.
Government feared the Aleuts would become allies with the Japanese
and/or be difficult to differentiate from potential Japanese spies.
White people who lived on the Aleutian Islands at that same time were
not interned. Internment in abandoned warehouses and canneries in
Southeast Alaska was the cause of significant numbers of death of
children and elders, physical injury, and illness among Aleut people.
Aleut internment during WWII is largely ignored as part of U.S. history.
[The shuffling of Indigenous people between Native]{.underline},
enslavable Other, [and]{.underline} Orientalized [Other]{.underline}16
[shows how [settler colonialism constructs and collapses its triad of
categories]{.mark}]{.underline}. This colonizing trick explains why
[[certain minorities]{.underline}]{.mark} can at times [[become model
and]{.underline}]{.mark} quasi-[[assimilable]{.underline}]{.mark} (as
exemplified by Asian settler colonialism, civil rights, model minority
discourse, and the use of 'hispanic' as an ethnic category to mean both
white and non-white) [[yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, in times of crisis,
[[revert to the status of foreign contagions]{.underline}]{.mark} (as
exemplified by Japanese Internment, Islamophobia, Chinese Exclusion, Red
Scare, anti-Irish nativism, WWII antisemitism, and
anti-Mexican-immigration). This is why 'labor' or 'workers' as an
agential political class fails to activate the decolonizing project.
"\[S\]hifting lines of the international division of labor" (Spivak,
1985, p. 84) bisect the very category of labor into caste-like bodies
built for work on one hand and rewardable citizen-workers on theother.
Some labor becomes settler, while excess labor becomes enslavable,
criminal, murderable. [The impossibility of fully becoming a white
settler]{.underline} - in this case, white referring to an
exceptionalized position with assumed rights to invulnerability and
legal supremacy - as articulated by minority literature preoccupied with
"glass ceilings" and "forever foreign" status and "myth of the model
minority", [offers a strong critique of the myth of the democratic
nationstate]{.underline}. However, [its logical endpoint, **[the
attainment of equal legal and cultural entitlements,
is]{.mark}**]{.underline} actually an **[[investment in settler
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, even the ability to be a
minority citizen in the settler nation means an option to become a brown
settler. For many people of color, becoming a subordinate settler is an
option even when becoming white is not. "Following stolen resources" is
a phrase that Wayne has encountered, used to describe Filipino overseas
labor (over 10% of the population of the Philippines is working abroad)
and other migrations from colony to metropole. This phrase is an
important anti-colonial framing of a colonial situation. However an
anti-colonial critique is not the same as a decolonizing framework;
anti-colonial critique often celebrates empowered postcolonial subjects
who seize denied privileges from the metropole. This
anti-to-post-colonial project doesn't strive to undo colonialism but
rather to remake it and subvert it. [[Seeking stolen resources is
entangled with]{.underline}]{.mark} settler [[colonialism because those
resources were]{.mark} nature/[Native first, then enlisted
into]{.mark}]{.underline} the service of [[settlement
and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus almost [[impossible to reclaim without
re-occupying Native land]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, the
postcolonial pursuit of resources is fundamentally an anthropocentric
model, as land, water, air, animals, and plants are never able to become
postcolonial; they remain objects to be exploited by the empowered
postcolonial subject. Equivocation is the vague equating of colonialisms
that erases the sweeping scope of land as the basis of wealth, power,
law in settler nation-states. Vocalizing a 'muliticultural' approach to
oppressions, or remaining silent on settler colonialism while talking
about colonialisms, or tacking on a gesture towards Indigenous people
without addressing Indigenous sovereignty or rights, or forwarding a
thesis on decolonization without regard to unsettling/deoccupying land,
are equivocations. That is, they ambiguously avoid engaging with settler
colonialism; they are ambivalent about minority / people of color /
colonized Others as settlers; they are cryptic about Indigenous land
rights in spaces inhabited by people of color.

### Constitution

#### The Constitution is built to oppose Indianness through the framing of the nation to fear the merciless Savages Byrd 2011

(Jodi A., Associate Professor of English and American Indian Studies at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, "The Transit of Empire:
Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism," 2011 pgs. xxi-xxii DH)

When read from this perspective, brief textual moments within [[U.S.
founding documents reveal the historical intent of a]{.mark} fledgling
[nation that pursued happiness through the acquisition of indigenous
lands]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of the many grievances enumerated [in [the
Declaration of Independence]{.underline}]{.mark}, one stands out as
particularly revealing: \"He . . . [has [endeavored to bring on the
inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known
rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes,
and conditions]{.mark}."]{.underline}9 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
non-discriminating, proto---inclusive "[[merciless Indian Savage\"
stands as the terrorist, externalized from "our frontiers'" and
functions as abjected horror through whom civilization is articulated
oppositionally]{.underline}]{.mark}. \'This non-recuperative category a
derealization of the Other, serves as a paranoid foundation for what
Jasbir K. Puar defines in Terrorist Assemblages as Islamic
"monster---terrorist-fags," the affectively produced and queered West
Asian (including South Asian, Arab American, and Mus- lim) body that is
targeted for surveillance and destruction by U.S. patriotic pathology.10
[just as the Declaration of Independence evokes "merciless Indian
savages" upon whom the violences of invasion are abjected in the pursuit
of lands, [the Commerce Clause]{.mark} of the U.S.
Constitution]{.underline} (Article I, Section 8, clause 3) [[invokes
Indianness to operational ends in order to evacuate sovereignty and
international recognition from any nation or peoples the United States
may one day seek to invade.]{.underline}]{.mark} The clause states that
Congress shall have the right \"to regulate Commerce with foreign
Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes."
Supreme Court justice John Marshall used this clause in Cherokee Nation
M Georgia (1831) to declare that, since Indian tribes were
"contradistinguished" from both "foreign nations" and "the several
states" within the clause, Indian tribes must instead be understood as
"domestic dependent nations" whose relationship to the United States was
that of wards "in a state of pupilage."11 Essentially [Marshall
concluded that because the Constitution delineated "Indian tribes\" as a
category at all, they inhabited a different space than "foreign
nations\" external to the United States and "the several states\"
internal to and subject to U.S. federalism. [Marshalls conclusion that
such definitional distinctions meant that American Indian
nations]{.mark}, despite the concrete evidence that they had entered
into treaties with European nations as well as the United States as
sovereigns within international law, [were]{.mark} somehow [dependent on
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tate[s for aboriginal title reveals the
larger colonialist agenda---to liberate Indians of their lives and
lands.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Democracy

#### The 1AC's demand on liberal democracy as an articulation of freedom is inhabited by the forgetting of intimate colonial violence that lays the condition of possibility. 

**Byrd 11** (Jodi A. Byrd, Associate Professor of English, Gender and
Women's Studies and Jewish Culture and Society at University of
Illinois, "The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism",
University of Minnesota Press, 2011, pages xxiv-xxvi)//Shreyas

[As civil rights, queer rights, and other rights [struggles]{.mark}
[have often cathected liberal democracy as the best possible avenue
to]{.mark} [redress]{.mark} the historical violences of and exclusions
from the state]{.underline}, [scholars and activists committed to social
justice have been left with impossible choices]{.underline}: [**[to
articulate freedom at the expense of another]{.mark}**, to seek power
and recognition in the hopes that we might avoid the syllogisms of
democracy created through colonialism]{.underline}. Lisa Lowe provides a
useful caution as she reminds us that "[[the affirmation of the desire
for freedom is so inhabited by the **forgetting of its condition of
possibility**]{.mark} [that every narrative articulation of freedom is
haunted by]{.mark} its burial, by the violence of
forgetting]{.underline}."¹⁸ [[The ethical moment before us is to]{.mark}
[comprehend]{.mark} "[the]{.mark} particular [loss of]{.mark} the
[intimacies]{.mark} of four continents, [to engage slavery, genocide,
indenture, and liberalism as a conjunction]{.mark}, as an actively
acknowledged loss within the present.]{.underline}"¹⁹ In attempting to
people the intimacies of four continents, Lowe activates the Chinese
indentured laborer in the Caribbean just after Britain abolished the
slave trade in as the affective entry point into "a range of
connections, the global intimacies out of which emerged not only modern
humanism but a modern racialized division of labor."²⁰ Her turn to the
colonial racialized labor force in the Americas helps to reveal the
degree to which intimacy---here tracked through the spheres of spatial
proximity, privacy, and volatility---among Africa, Asia, and Europe in
the Americas has served as the forgotten and disavowed constitutive
means through which liberal humanism defines freedom, family, equality,
and humanity. [In fact, [liberal humanism]{.mark}, according to Lowe,
[depends upon the]{.mark} "'[**economy of affirmation and
forgetting**']{.mark}" not just of particular streams of human history,
but of the loss of their geographies, histories, and
subjectivities.]{.underline}²¹ In the indeterminacies between and among
freedom, enslavement, indentureship, interior, and exterior, the
recovered Asian contract laborer, functioning as historical site for
Lowe, can reveal the processes through which [liberalism asserts freedom
and [forgets enslavement as the condition of possibility for what
constitutes "the human."]{.mark}]{.underline} "[Freedom
was]{.underline}," Lowe stresses, "[constituted through a narrative
dialectic that rested simultaneously on a spatialization of the unfree
as exteriority and a temporal subsuming of enslavement as internal
difference or contradiction]{.underline}. The 'overcoming' of internal
contradiction resolves in freedom within the modern Western political
sphere through displacement and elision of the coeval conditions of
slavery and indentureship in the Americas."²² But what seems to me to be
further disavowed, even in Lowe's important figuration of the history of
labor in "the intimacies of four continents," is the settler colonialism
that such labor underwrites. Asia, Africa, and Europe all meet in the
Americas to labor over the dialectics of free and unfree, but what of
the Americas themselves and the prior peoples upon whom that labor took
place? Lowe includes "native peoples" in her figurations as an addendum
when she writes that she hopes "to evoke the political economic logics
through which men and women from Africa and Asia were forcibly
transported to the Americas, who with native, mixed, and creole peoples
constituted slave societies, the profits of which gave rise to bourgeois
republican states in Europe and North America."²³ [By positioning the
conditions of slavery and indentureship in the Americas as coeval
contradictions through which Western freedom affirms and resolves
itself]{.underline}, and then by collapsing the indigenous Americas into
slavery, the fourth continent of settler colonialism through which such
intimacy is made to labor is not just forgotten or elided; it becomes
the very ground through which the other three continents struggle
intimately for freedom, justice, and equality. Within Lowe's
formulation, the native peoples of the Americas are collapsed into
slavery; their only role within the disavowed intimacies of
racialization is either one equivalent to that of African slaves or
their ability to die so imported labor can make use of their lands.
Thus, within the "intimacies of four continents," [[indigenous
peoples]{.mark} in the new world [cannot]{.mark}, in this system, [give
rise to any]{.mark} historical [agency]{.mark} or status within the
"economy of affirmation and forgetting,"]{.underline} because [[they are
the transit through which the dialectic]{.mark} of subject and object
[occurs]{.mark}.]{.underline} In many ways, then, this book argues for a
critical reevaluation of the elaboration of these historical processes
of oppression within postcolonial, critical race, queer, and American
studies at the beginning of the twentyfirst century. By foundationally
accepting the general premise that racialization (along with the
concomitant interlocking oppressions of class, gender, and sexuality)
causes the primary violences of U.S. politics in national and
international arenas, [multicultural liberalism has aligned itself with
settler colonialism despite professing the goal to disrupt and intervene
in global forms of dominance through investments in colorblind
equality.]{.underline} Simply put, [prevailing understandings of race
and racialization within U.S. postcolonial, area, and queer studies
depend upon an historical aphasia of the conquest of indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} Further, these framings have forgotten, as
Moreton-Robinson has argued, that "the question of how anyone came to be
white or black in the United States is inextricably tied to the
dispossession of the original owners and the assumption of white
possession."²⁴ [[Calls to social justice]{.mark} for U.S. racialized,
sexualized, immigrant, and diasporic queer communities that include
indigenous peoples, [if]{.mark} they are [not attuned to the ongoing
conditions of settler colonialism]{.mark} of indigenous peoples, [risk
deeming colonialism]{.mark} in North America [resolved]{.mark}, if not
redressed, two cents for billion dollars.]{.underline}

#### Their protest for democratic representation is inevitably sutured by a drive to colonize -- turns the aff.

**Byrd 11** (Jodi A. Byrd, Associate Professor of English, Gender and

Though Collier claimed he was tongue-tied and embarrassed in the face of
the hardships of relocation that those Japanese Americans who had
already arrived at the camps had endured, he tried to frame their
suffering within a larger purpose. "You are here," he assured the
captive listeners, "in the capacity of full citizens of the American
commonwealth. Being here in that capacity, it is for you to determine
your own fashion of life, your own methods of cooperative action, to
make your own life." Speaking as a representative of the Department of
the Interior and gesturing towards the office he held as commissioner of
Indian Affairs, [Collier shared his philosophy and vision for both the
American commonwealth and the version of democracy that underpins U.S.
colonization and imperialism.]{.underline} "[[We in this
country]{.underline}]{.mark}," he continued, [[join with the
people]{.underline}]{.mark} of England, the people of Australia, with
the Free French, China, etc., [in asserting that Democracy is the right
way of life. [We are waging **a war for Democracy**]{.mark}. That war is
going to be won. There is not the slightest doubt. But when we look
around within our own country, whether it be on a national or local
scale, [we do not find that Democracy has been achieved]{.mark}. It has
not been achieved in any of these countries and certainly not in the
United States. [Our Democracy **is an imperfect**]{.mark}, embryonic
institution as yet.]{.underline}³ Collier's speech that summer day in
the dusty and temporary Japanese American "colony" reflected an
ambivalent administrator seeking to reassure his fellow citizens that
though an injustice had been done, there was also an opportunity to
undertake a great social experiment. Though Collier was speaking to the
internees from the ambivalent vantage point of the
not-quite-yet-greatest-generation administrator of a wartime
incarceration, [his [evocation of a "war for Democracy]{.mark}" eerily
[foreshadows]{.mark} George W. Bush's post **[justification for the war
on terror]{.mark}** and the militaristic desire [to inflict democracy
the world over as panacea for a failing capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
At the same time, [[Collier's assessment]{.mark} that "our Democracy is
an imperfect, embryonic institution" [mirrors]{.mark} Barack [Obama's
delineation of the United States as a **perfecting union**]{.mark},
still struggling with racial divides and inequalities.⁴]{.underline}
[[Captured within]{.mark} Collier's dualistic allegory of democracy as
unfulfilled battleground and as [promise for a more perfect union are
the seeds of a fracturing neoliberalism that pulled conservative and
liberal discourses into a biopolitical assemblage justifying recursive
colonialisms that]{.mark}, during World War II, served to enjamb
Japanese American detainees within the histories of containment and
expropriation that strip lands and nations from American
Indians.]{.underline} By naming the relocation centers and internment
camps "colonies" within their internal documents, [[the United States
revealed the **deeper logics of removals and
reservations**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} and Collier, who saw in Poston
an opportunity to develop a social experiment that might innovate future
management strategies within the Office of Indian Affairs, had already
laid the groundwork so that Hopi and Navajo families might join those
relocation colonies after the war ended to continue the work started by
the Japanese American internees. In the process, [[the transformation of
indigenous peoples from colonized to colonist]{.mark} within the
historical record [helps to lay the **foundation**]{.mark} for a
doublebarreled Korematsu "loaded weapon" [that provides the basis for
U.S. sovereignty dependent upon settler colonialism]{.mark} and its
ability to enact a state of exception against its own citizens and
citizens of other nations]{.underline}.⁵

At the same time, cathecting an "after" to racialization and colonialism
transforms the United States, or at least the lands it occupies, into a
geopolitical space that offers asylum to global and transnational
diasporas that resist or refuse the normativities of nation-states and
nationalism that make "home" impossible. Nandita Sharma and Cynthia
Wright, for instance, suggest that "for those defined as outside the new
nationalized polity---or even as its 'enemies'---migration is one of the
few available 'escape routes' for life."⁵³ In arguing against indigenous
claims to land, sovereignty, and nation, they suggest that autochthony
stands, in the face of global capitalism and migration that now inform
the postcolonial world, as xenophobic elitism that traffics as
neoliberal hatred of foreigners.⁵⁴ [To resolve the dialectics of
indigeneity that, for them, stand as regressive neoracism in light of
the global diasporas arising from oppression around the world, Sharma
and Wright cast indigeneity as untenable [by arguing that colonialism
and]{.mark} the [resistance]{.mark}s to it [are better understood
"as]{.mark} [the theft of the commons, the agents of decolonization as
the commoners, and decolonization as the gaining of a global
commons]{.mark}."⁵⁵]{.underline} [[Autochthony and indigeneity]{.mark}
in this view [become regressive antimodern oppositional identities that
stand as obstacle to the gaining of a commons]{.mark} as the means to
the end of oppression within the lands that once did, but no longer can
or should, belong to indigenous peoples.]{.underline} [Michael Hardt and
Antonio Negri make a similar argument in Commonwealth when they
state:]{.underline} ["[We are all entangled and complicit]{.mark} in the
identities, hierarchies, and corruptions of the current forms of
power.]{.underline} [[Revolution requires]{.mark} not merely
[emancipation]{.mark}, as we said earlier, but [liberation]{.mark}; not
just an event of destruction but also a long and sustained process of
transformation, creating a new humanity."]{.underline} They continue:
"[Making the multitude is thus [a project of democratic
organizing]{.mark} aimed at democracy.]{.underline}"⁵⁶ [To resist the
hierarchies of identity, class, and race that have demarcated the world
[through access to power]{.mark} requires that democracy be made anew,
so that "democracy must not only be the goal of a multitude with the
already developed powers necessary for self-government but also a
learning mechanism, a dispositif, that expands those powers, increasing
not only the capacity but [also the desire to participate in
government]{.mark}.]{.underline}"⁵⁷ Hardt and Negri's multitudinous
[insurrectional parallelism]{.underline} that draws upon Deleuze and
Guattari's "Indians without ancestry" [is [ultimately]{.mark}, despite
its global vision for revolution against the normativities of property,
family, and nation, a project not unlike the one John Collier delineated
at Poston Relocation Center when he told the internees that democracy
remained yet embryonic.]{.underline} "In this community of yours,"
Collier promised, "you will be not only gaining for yourselves
satisfaction, and power, and fame, but will be rendering to this country
and to the other countries, including Japan, a momentous sociological
human service, lasting peace and a happy humanity."⁵⁸ There is, as
Agamben points out, "an inner solidarity between democracy and
totalitarianism."⁵⁹ This parallax gap makes locating the fascist and
liberatory within democratic philosophies difficult to escape even as
pluralizing discourses head towards restructuring political institutions
to be more just, so they provide more life. Further, [any notion of the
commons that speaks for and as indigenous as it advocates transforming
indigenous governance or incorporating indigenous peoples into a
multitude that might then reside on those lands forcibly taken from
indigenous peoples [does nothing to disrupt the genocidal and
colonialist intent of the initial and now repeated historical
process]{.mark}.⁶⁰]{.underline}

### Deleuze & Guattari

#### The 1AC's call to move beyond the subject is a form of humanist masochism which produces a ruse of subjectless-ness -- this conceals the desire for white ascendency which undergirds their transgression of the human, morphing their project into a philic desire to inhabit the bodies of Black and Indigenous people fixed as abject -- it's not a question of the human or the subject but the scaffolding of antiblack settler-colonial positionality that produces gratuitous deathmaking King 17

**[[Poststructuralist traditions that attempt to transcend

it [as exceptional reifies norms of whiteness and masculinity and

This article argues that **[both refusal and skepticism can work in
tandem and interrupt the performance of white innocence through
less-than-effective attempts to evade representation that jettison the
garb of the human without abolishing the need for Black and Indigenous
death]{.underline}**.47

### Extinction

**Fear of extinction is a fabricated settler paradox that settler
colonialism uses to for settler futurity -- this relieves the settler of
guilt and gives value to settler life at the cost of genocide**

[**[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}**;]{.mark} [to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come.]{.underline} This
tendency is widely prevalent in English-language representations of
settler colonialism produced since the 1980s: [the possibility of an
ending -- the likelihood that the settler race will one day die out --
is a common theme]{.underline} in literary and pop culture
considerations of colonialism's future. Yet it has barely been remarked
how surprising it is that this theme is so present. [For settlers, of
all people, to obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is
counterintuitive, for few modern social for- mations have been more
resistant to change than settler colonialism]{.underline}. With a few
excep- tions (French Algeria being the largest), the settler societies
established in the last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and
Southern Africa have all retained the basic features that define them as
settler states -- namely, the structural privileging of settlers at the
expense of indigenous peoples, and the normalization of whiteness as the
marker of pol- itical agency and rights -- and they have done so
notwithstanding the sustained resistance¶ that has been mounted whenever
such an order has been built[. [Settlers think all the time that they
might one day end, even though]{.mark}]{.underline} (perhaps because)
[[that ending seems unlikely ever to happen.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
significance of this paradox for settler-colonial literature is the
subject of this article.¶ [Considering the problem of futurity offers a
useful foil to traditional analyses of settler- colonial narrative,
which typically examine settlers' attitudes towards history in order to
highlight a constitutive anxiety about the past -- about
origins.]{.underline} Settler colonialism, the argument goes, has a
problem with historical narration that arises from a contradiction in
its founding mythology. In Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler
subject is by definition one who comes from elsewhere but who strives to
make this place home. The settlement narrative must explain how this gap
-- which is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has
been bridged, and the settler transformed from outsider into indigene.
Yet the transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because
the desire to be at home necessarily invokes the spectre of the native,
whose existence (which cannot be disavowed completely because it is
needed to define the settler's difference, superior- ity, and hence
claim to the land) inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating
the gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to
efface.1 [Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around its need to
erase and evoke the native,]{.underline} to make the indigene both
invisible and present in a contradictory pattern that prevents settlers
from ever moving on from the moment of colonization.2 [As evidence of
this constitutive contradiction, critics have identified in
settler-colonial discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as
disavowal, inversion, and repression.]{.underline}3 Indeed, [the frozen
temporality of settler-colonial narrative, fixated on the moment of the
frontier, recalls nothing so much as Freud's description of the
'repetition compulsion' attending trauma.]{.underline}4 As Lorenzo
Veracini puts it, because:¶ '[[settler society']{.underline}]{.mark} can
thus be seen [[as a fantasy where a perception of a constant struggle is
juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can never be
reached]{.mark}, settler projects embrace and reject violence at the
same time. **[The settler colonial situation is]{.mark}**]{.underline}
thus a **[[circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses
produces long-lasting psychic conflicts and]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
number of associated **[[psychopathologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**.5¶
Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on settler-colonial
narrative's view of the past, asking how such a contradictory and
troubled relationship to history might affect present-day ideological
formations. Critics have rarely considered what such narratological
tensions might produce when the settler gaze is turned to the future.
Few social formations are more stubbornly resistant to change than
settlement, suggesting that a future beyond settler colonialism might be
simply unthinkable. Veracini, indeed, suggests that **[settler-colonial
narrative can never contemplate an ending: [that settler decolonization
is inconceivable because settlers lack the metaphorical tools to imagine
their own demise]{.mark}]{.underline}**.6 This article outlines why I
partly disagree with that view. I argue that the narratological paradox
that defines settler-colonial narrative does make the future a
problematic object of contemplation. But that does not make settler
decolonization unthinkable per se; as I will show,
**[[settlers]{.mark}]{.underline}** do often **[[try to imagine their
demise]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- but they do so **[[in a way that
reasserts the paradoxes of their founding ideology,]{.mark} with the
result that the radical potentiality of decolonization is undone even as
it is invoked.]{.underline}**¶ I argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's
analysis, [there is a metaphor via which the end of settler colonialism
unspools -- the quasi-biological concept of extinction, which, when
deployed as a narrative trope, offers settlers a chance to consider and
disavow their demise, just as they consider and then disavow the
violence of their origins]{.underline}. This article traces the
importance of the trope of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial
litera- ture, with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and Australia. It
explores variations in how the death of settler colonialism is
conceptualized, drawing a distinction between his- torio-civilizational
narratives of the rise and fall of empires, [and [a species-oriented
notion of extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} that draws force from public
anxiety about climate change -- an invocation that [[adds another level
of ambivalence by drawing on 'rational' fears for the
future]{.underline}]{.mark} (because climate change may well render the
planet uninhabitable to humans[) [in order to narrativize a form of
social death]{.mark} that, strictly speaking, belongs to a different
order of knowledge altogether]{.underline}. As such, my analysis is
intended to draw the attention of settler- colonial studies toward
futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia, while highlighting a
potential point of cross-fertilization between settler-colonial and
eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.¶ [That 'extinction'
should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon is no
surprise]{.underline}. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [settler [colonialism
is predicated on a 'logic of elimination']{.mark} that tends towards the
extermination -- by one means or another -- [of indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal
settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans
(1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the melancholia and
triumph [[that demarcate settlers' affective responses to the supposed
inevitability of indigenous extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Concepts
like 'stadial development' -- by which societies progress through
stages, progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and 'fatal
impact' -- [which names the biological inevitability of strong peoples
supplanting weak -- all contribute to the notion that settler
colonialism is a kind of 'ecological process' that necessitates the
extinction of inferior races.]{.underline} What is surprising, though,
is how often [the trope of extinction also appears with reference to
settlers themselves; it makes sense for settlers to narrate how their
presence entails others' destruction, but it is less clear why their
attempts to imagine futures should presume extinction to be their own
logical end as well]{.underline}.¶ The idea appears repeatedly in
English-language literary treatments of settler colonial- ism. Consider,
for instance, the following rumination on the future of South African
settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm:¶
It was one of them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those
pictures there. He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make
something, so he made these. \[\...\] Now the Boers have shot them all,
so that we never see a yellow face peeping out among the stones.
\[\...\] And the wild bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here.
But we will be gone soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at
everything like they look now.10¶ In this example, the narrating settler
character, Waldo, recognizes prior indigenous inha- bitation but his
knowledge comes freighted with an expected sense of biological super-
iority, made apparent by his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow
face', and lack of mental self-awareness. What is not clear is why
Waldo's contemplation of colonial geno- cide should turn immediately to
the assumption that a similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar
presumption of racial vulnerability permeates other late nineteenth-
century novels from the imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of
the Worlds,¶ which are plotted around the prospect of invasions that
would see the extinction of British imperialism, and, in the process,
the human species.¶ Such anxieties draw energy from a pattern of settler
defensiveness that can be observed across numerous settler-colonial
contexts. Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of the emergence of
transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical fact that while
white male settlers have been arguably the most privileged class in
history, they have routinely perceived themselves to be 'under siege',
threatened with destruction to the extent that their very identity of
'whiteness was born in the apprehension of immi- nent loss'.11 The fear
of looming annihilation serves a powerful ideological function in
settler communities, working to foster racial solidarity, suppress
dissent, and legitimate violence against indigenous populations who, by
any objective measure, are far more at risk of extermination than the
settlers who fear them. Ann Curthoys and Dirk Moses have traced this
pattern in Australia and Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 **[This
scholarship suggests that narratives of [settler extinction are acts of
ideological mystification, obscuring the brutal inequalities of the
frontier behind a mask of white vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
an argument with which I sympathize. However, this article shows how
there is more to settler-colonial extinction narratives than bad faith.
I argue that [we need a more nuanced understanding of how they encode a
specifically settler-colonial framework for imagining the
future]{.underline}, one that has implications for how we understand
contemporary literatures from settler societies, and which allows us to
see extinction as a genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage social
change.¶ In the remainder of this paper I consider extinction's function
as a metaphor of decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke, without
completely endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argu- ment that to treat
decolonization figuratively, as I argue **[[extinction
narratives]{.mark}]{.underline}** do, is necessarily to **[[preclude
radical change, creating opportunities for settler 'moves to innocence'
that re-legitimate racial inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13 The
counterview to this pessimistic perspec- tive is offered by Veracini,
who suggests that progressive change to settler-colonial relationships
will only happen if narratives can be found that make decolonization
think- able.14 This article enters the debate between these two
perspectives by asking what it means for settler writers to imagine the
future via the trope of extinction. Does extinction offer a meaningful
way to think about ending settler colonialism, or does it re-activate
settler-colonial patterns of thought that allow exclusionary social
structures to persist?¶ I explore this question with reference to
examples of contemporary literary treatments of extinction from select
English-speaking settler-colonial contexts: South Africa, Australia, and
Canada.15 The next section of this article traces key elements of
extinction narrative in a range of settler-colonial texts, while the
section that follows offers a detailed reading of one of the best
examples of a sustained literary exploration of human finitude, Margaret
Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I advance four specific
arguments. First, extinc- tion narratives take at least two forms
depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is framed primarily in
historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger, biological sense; the
key question is whether the 'thing' that is going extinct is a society
or a species. Second, [[biologically oriented extinction narratives rely
on]{.mark}]{.underline} a more or less conscious [[slippage between 'the
settler' and 'the human']{.underline}]{.mark}. Third, [this slippage is
ideologically ambivalent:]{.underline} on the one hand, it contains a
radical charge that invokes environmentalist discourse and
climate-change anxiety to imagine social forms that re-write
settler-colonial dynamics; on the other, it
[[replicates]{.mark}]{.underline} a core aspect of [[imperialist
ideology by normalizing whiteness as¶ equivalent to
humanity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fourth, **[these ideological effects are
mediated by gender,]{.underline}** insofar as **[extinction narratives
invoke issues of biological reproduction, community protection, and
violence that function to differentiate and reify masculine and feminine
roles in the putative de-colonial future.]{.underline}** Overall, my
central claim is that extinction is a core trope through which settler
futurity emerges, one with crucial narrative and ideological effects
that shape much of the contemporary literature emerging from white
colonial settings.

### Nuclear War

#### Their invocation of nuclear weapons' existential threat overwrites the ongoing threat that the violence of the nuclear cycle poses to Fourth World peoples, sanitizing genocide

The vigorous invasion of the logic of capitalist accumulation into the
last vestige of relatively autonomous space in the periphery under late
capitalism is propelled not only by the desire for incorporating every
fabric of the society into the division of labor but also by the desire
for \"pure\" destruction/extermination of the periphery.\" The
penetration of capital into the social fabric and the destruction of
nature and preexisting social organizations by capital are not
separable. However, what we have witnessed in the phase of late
capitalism is a rapid intensification of the destruction and
extermination of the periphery. In this context, capital is no longer
interested in incorporating some parts of the periphery into the
international division of labor. The emergence of such \"pure\"
destruction/extermination of the periphery can be explained, at least
partially, by another problematic of late capitalism formulated by
Ernest Mandel: the mass production of the means of destruction.\"
Particularly, [the latest phase of [capitalism distinguishes
itself]{.mark}]{.underline} from the earlier phases [[in its production
of the \"ultimate\" means of
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}/extermination, i.e., [[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. Let us recall our earlier discussion about
the critical historical conjuncture where the notion of \"strategy\"
changed its nature and became deregulated/dispersed beyond the
boundaries set by the interimperial rivalry. Herein, the perception of
the ultimate means of destruction can be historically contextualized.
[[The only]{.mark} instances of]{.underline} real [[nuclear
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark} perceived and thus
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} due [[recognition]{.underline}]{.mark} by
the First World community [[are]{.mark} the explosions at [Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.mark}]{.underline}, which occurred at this conjuncture.
Beyond this historical threshold, whose meaning is relevant only to the
interimperial rivalry, the [nuclear [catastrophe is confined
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the realm of fantasy, for instance,
[[apocalyptic imagery]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[yet]{.mark} how can
one deny]{.underline} the crude fact that [[nuclear war has been taking
place]{.underline}]{.mark} on this earth [[in the name of]{.mark}
\"nuclear [testing]{.mark}\" [since]{.mark}]{.underline} the first
nuclear explosion at Alamogordo in [[1945]{.mark}? As of 1991, 1,924
nuclear explosions have occurred]{.underline} on earth.\" The major
perpetrators of nuclear warfare are the United States (936 times), the
former Soviet Union (715 times), France (192times), the United Kingdom
(44 times), and China (36 times).\" [[The primary targets]{.mark} of
warfare]{.underline} (\"test site\" to use Nuke Speak terminology)
[[have been]{.underline}]{.mark} invariably the sovereign nations of
Fourth World and [[Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus history
has already witnessed the nuclear wars against the Marshall Islands (66
times), French Polynesia (175 times), Australian Aborigines (9 times),
Newe Sogobia (the Western Shoshone Nation) (814 times), the Christmas
Islands (24 times), Hawaii (Kalama Island, also known as Johnston
Island) (12 times), the Republic of Kazakhstan (467 times), and Uighur
(Xinjian Province, China) (36 times).\" Moreover, although I focus
primarily on \"nuclear tests\" in this article, [if we are to
expand]{.underline} the notion of [[nuclear warfare]{.mark} to
[include]{.mark}]{.underline} any kind of violence accrued from the
nuclear fuel cycle (particularly [[uranium mining and]{.mark}
disposition of [nuclear wastes]{.mark}]{.underline}), [we must enlist
Japan and]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an nations [as
perpetrators]{.underline} and add the Navaho, Havasupai and other
Indigenous Nations to the list of targets. Viewed as a whole, nuclear
war, albeit undeclared, has been waged against the Fourth World, and
Indigenous Nations. The dismal consequences of \"intensive
exploitation,\" \"low intensity intervention,\" or the \"nullification
of the sovereignty\" in the Third World produced by the First World have
taken a form of nuclear extermination in the Fourth World and Indigenous
Nations. Thus, [[from the perspectives of the Fourth
World]{.underline}]{.mark} and Indigenous Nations, [[the nuclear
catastrophe has never been]{.mark} the
[\"unthinkable\"]{.mark}]{.underline} single [catastrophe but
the]{.underline} real [catastrophe of]{.underline} repetitive and
[ongoing nuclear explosions]{.underline} and exposure to radioactivity.
Nevertheless, ongoing [[nuclear wars have been subordinated to the
imaginary]{.underline}]{.mark} grand catastrophe [[by rendering
them]{.underline}]{.mark} as mere [[preludes to the
apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a consequence, the history and
ongoing processes of nuclear explosions as war have been totally wiped
out from the history and consciousness of the First World community.
Such a discursive strategy that aims to mask the \"real\" of nuclear
warfare in the domain of imagery of nuclear catastrophe can be observed
even in Stewart Firth\'s Nuclear Playground, which extensively covers
the history of \"nuclear testing\" in the Pacific: Nuclear explosions in
the atmosphere . . . were global in effect. The winds and seas carried
radioactive contamination over vast areas of the fragile ecosphere on
which we all depend for our survival and which we call the earth. In
preparing for war, we were poisoning our planet and going into battle
against nature itself. Although Firth\'s book is definitely a
remarkablde study of the history of \"nuclear testing\" in the Pacific,
the problematic division/distinction between the \"nuclear explosions\"
and the nuclear war is kept intact. [[The imagery of final nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark} narrated with the problematic use of the
subject (\"we\") [[is located higher than the \"real\" of nuclear
warfare in]{.underline}]{.mark} terms of [[discursive value]{.mark}.
This]{.underline} ideological [division]{.underline}/hierarchization [is
the]{.underline} very [vehicle through which]{.underline} the [history
and]{.underline} the ongoing processes of the [destruction of the Fourth
World]{.underline} and Indigenous Nations by means of nuclear violence
[are]{.underline} obliterated and hence [legitimatized.
[The]{.mark}]{.underline} discursive containment/[[obliteration of the
\"real\"]{.underline}]{.mark} of nuclear warfare [[has been
accomplished]{.underline}]{.mark}, ironic as it may sound, [[by nuclear
criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nuclear [criticism]{.underline}, with
its firm commitment to global discourse, [has established
the]{.underline} unshakable [authority of]{.underline} the
[imagery]{.underline} of nuclear catastrophe [over the real nuclear
catastrophe happening in]{.underline} the Fourth World and Indigenous
Nations almost [on a daily basis]{.underline}.

### USFG

#### the United States federal government is a semiotic representation of native genocide -- any use of united states policy comes at the expense of indigenous sovereignty and makes decolonization impossible 

**Rifkin 9** Mark Rifkin, "Indigenizing Agamben: Rethinking Sovereignty
in Light of the 'Peculiar' Status of Native Peoples," *Cultural
Critique* 73 (Fall 2009): 88-124 // jazmyn

The \"People\" stands less for the actual assemblage of persons within
the state than for the set of those who fit the ideal \"body\" and who
consequently will be recognized as \"citizens,\" with the rest of the
resident population consigned to the realm of \"bare life\"-the people
who are not the People and thus are excluded from meaningful
participation while remaining the objects of state control. However,
when reflecting on the status of Indigenous populations in relation to
the settler-state, a third category emerges that is neither people nor
People-namely peoples. The possibility of [conceptualizing the nation
as]{.underline} \"[a]{.underline} whole [political body]{.underline}\"
[requires narrating it as \"a unitary subject\" rather than a collection
of]{.underline} separate, unsubordinated, self-governing
[polities]{.underline}. Conversely, [for \"inclusion\" to be articulated
as \"total,\" it needs to have a clear domain over which it is
extended]{.underline}. In critiquing the approach of previous theorists
to the issue of sovereignty, Agamben notes, \"The problem of sovereignty
was reduced to the question of who within the political order was
invested with certain powers, and the very threshold of the political
order itself was never called into question\" (12), but Agamben\'s
account itself assumes a clear \"within\" by not posing the question of
how [sovereignty produces and is produced by place]{.underline}, how the
state is realized as a spatial phenomenon as part of \"the very
threshold of the political order itself.\" I am suggesting, then, that
[the biopolitical project of defining the]{.underline} proper
[\"body\"]{.underline} of the people [is subtended by the geopolitical
project of defining the territoriality of the nation, displacing
competing claims by older]{.underline}/other political
[formations]{.underline} as what we might call bare habitance. Agamben
notes, \"The camp is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical
order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space\'\' (169-70),
but that definition also seems to capture rather precisely the status of
the reservation, a space that while governed under \"peculiar\" rules
categorically is denied status as \"external,\" or \"foreign.\"
[Examining the reservation]{.underline}, and more broadly the
representation of Native collectivity and territoriality in U.S.
governmental discourses, through the prism of Agamben\'s analysis of the
state of exception [helps highlight the]{.underline} kinds of
[\'\'sovereign violence\" at play in the]{.underline} (re)production and
[naturalization of national space]{.underline}.8 The effort to think
biopolitics without geopolitics, bare life without bare habitance,
results in the erasure of the politics of collectivity and occupancy:
what entities will count as polities and thus be seen as deserving of
autonomy, what modes of inhabitance and land tenure will be understood
as legitimate, and who will get to make such determinations and on what
basis?9 Focusing on the fracture between \"the People\" and \"the
people\" imagines explicitly or implicitly either a reconciliation of
the two (restoring a version of the \"trinity\" of state, land, and
birth) or the proliferation of a boundary less humanness unconstrained
by territorially circumscribed polities. These options leave little room
for thinking indigeneity, the existence of peoples forcibly made
domestic whose self-understandings and aspirations cannot be understood
in terms of the denial of (or disjunctions within) state citizenship.10
While in the next section I will address how biopolitical and
geopolitical dynamics work together, specifically in the translation of
Native peoples into aggregates of individual domestic subjects (as
either a race or a culture), I first want to explore in greater detail
how [the production of national space depends on coding Native peoples
and lands as an exception]{.underline}. Administrative
**[mappings]{.underline}** of U.S. jurisdiction **[remain
haunted]{.underline}** by the presence of polities whose occupancy
precedes that of the state and whose existence as collectivities
repeatedly has been officially recognized through treaties. The Supreme
Court decisions with which I began all register this difficulty. In
Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, the court explicitly finds that the \"acts
of our government plainly recognize the Cherokee nation as a state,\"
indicating they are \'\'a distinct political society, separated from
others, capable of managing its own affairs and governing itself\" (16).
Yet the majority opinion also insists, \'\'The Indian territory is
admitted to compose a part of the United States,\" adding, \"They occupy
a territory to which we assert a title independent of their will\" (17).
Following a similar line of reasoning, U.S. v. Kagama insists \"the
colonies before the Revolution and the States and the United States
since, have recognized in the Indians a possessory right to the soil. .
. . But they asserted an ultimate title in the land itself\" (381), and
Justice Rehnquist in Oliphant v. Suquamish argues, \"Indian tribes do
retain elements of \'quasisovereign\' authority after ceding their lands
to the United States,\" although \"their exercise of separate power is
constrained so as not to conflict with the interests of \[the U.S.\'s\]
overriding sovereignty\" (208- 9). Each of [these formulations
acknowledges a tension between]{.underline} the kinds of political
identity and authority suggested by the ability to enter into formal
agreements with [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the
claim that]{.underline} such otherwise (or previously)
\"[distinct]{.underline} political [societ\[ies\]]{.underline}\"
[are]{.underline} fully [enclosed within the boundaries of the state and
thus subject]{.underline} in some fashion [to its rule]{.underline}.

### Postmodernism (Fluid Identity)

#### Our next link is TRUTH---American Indian identity is rooted in the struggle for sovereignty---their argument that we should engage multiple perspectives and truth overblur cultural lines and encourage a nihilism which is anathema to Native survival

**Grande 0** \[Sandy, Associate Professor of Education at Connecticut
College, "American Indian identity and intellectualism: The quest for a
new red pedagogy," *International Journal of Qualitative Studies in
Education* 13.4 (2000): 343-359\]

[[Postmodern theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} critique essentialist
constructions of race (and other identity categories) and, instead,
[[maintain]{.mark} that ''[identity]{.mark}'' [is shaped]{.mark} and
determined [by]{.mark} social and historical [contingencies]{.mark} [and
not by some checklist of innate]{.mark}, biological, or primordial
[characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline} (DeLaurentis, 1989). Identity is,
in other words, viewed as a highly relative construct acting out within
a broader reality that resembles ''a theater of simulation marked by the
free play of images, disembodied signifiers and, the heterogeneity of
differences '' (Ebert, 1991, p. 15). Within this context, empiricist
notions of knowable and absolute determiners of origin and authenticity
dissolve and along with them, essentialist constructions of identity. In
short, it asserts the ''postmodern condition '' as one in which grand
narratives of legitimization are no longer credible. As such, it appears
that postmodernism provides a theoretical pathway out of the illogic of
essentialism, however, the attack on grand narrative or totality is not
without its drawbacks. [Postmodernist [constructions of identity as
''free-floating'']{.mark} can [result in an overblurring of
boundaries]{.mark}, and its categorical [rejection of grand narratives
fails to distinguish the]{.mark} critical [difference between master
narratives of oppression and formative narratives that provide the basis
for]{.mark} historically and relationally [situating]{.mark} different
[groups within some common project]{.mark}]{.underline} (McLaren &
Giroux, 1997). [This aspect of [postmodernist discourse]{.mark} not only
[reflects ''an ontological agnosticism'' that relinquishes]{.mark} the
primacy of [social transformation but also encourages a]{.mark}
''epistemological [relativism that calls for a tolerance for a range of
meanings without advocating any single one of them]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(McLaren, 1998, p. 242). [Such [nihilistic tendencies present a]{.mark}
real and significant [threat to]{.mark} American [Indian communities
struggling to define their sociopolitical relationship to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. [Unlike other subjugated groups,
struggling to define their]{.mark} own local [narratives within the
democratic project]{.mark}, American [Indians have not been working
toward greater inclusion in the democratic imaginary but]{.mark},
rather, [have]{.mark} been [engaged in a]{.mark} centuries long
[struggle for]{.mark} the recognition of [their sovereignty.
This]{.mark} particular [aspect of the Indigenous struggle]{.mark}
completely transforms and [reframes]{.mark} the identity [question,
moving it]{.mark} from the superficial realm of cultural politics [to
the]{.mark} more profound [arena of cultural
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### And, IDENTITY---postmodern notions of fluid identity ALWAYS work to destroy Native culture, sanitizing genocide and assimilation

**Grande 4** \[Sandy, Associate Professor of Education at Connecticut
College, *Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought*, p
112-113\]

Whether it is land, spiritual practice, or genetic material that is
being mined, appropriated, and sold, the logic of domination remains the
same- in the eyes of U.S. law and policy the collective rights and
concerns of indigenous peoples are considered subordinate to individual
rights. Thus, **[the extension of marketplace logic to the realms of
cultural and intellectual property not only extends the power of the
whitestream but also diminishes the power of indigenous communities,
continuing the project of cultural imperialism that began over five
hundred years ago.]{.underline}** In view of the above, **[it is clear
to see how [postmodernism - the notion of fluid boundaries, the
relativizing of difference and negation of grand narratives - primarily
serves whitestream America]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The multiphrenia of
postmodern plurality, its \"world of simulation\" and obliteration of
any sense of objective reality, has given rise to a frenetic search for
the \"authentic\" led by culture vultures and capitalist bandits fraught
with \"imperialist nostalgia.\"25 **[In response, [American Indian
communities have restricted access to the discursive spaces of American
Indian]{.mark} culture and [identity and]{.mark} the [nondiscursive
borders]{.mark} of American Indian communities. In short, [the notion of
fluidity has never worked to the advantage of indigenous peoples.
Federal agencies]{.mark} have [invoke]{.mark}d [the language of
fluid]{.mark} or unstable [identities as the rationale for dismantling
the structures of tribal life. Whitestream America has seized
upon]{.mark} the message of [relativism to declare open season on
Indians, and whitestream academics have employ]{.mark}ed [the language
of]{.mark} signification and [simulation to transmute centuries of war
between indigenous peoples]{.mark} [and]{.mark} their respective
[nation-states into a]{.mark} \"genetic and [cultural
dialogue]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** (Valle and Torres 1995, 141). Thus, in
spite of its \"democratic\" promise, **[[postmodernism and its ludic
theories of identity fail to provide indigenous communities the]{.mark}
theoretical [grounding for asserting their claims as colonized peoples,
and]{.mark}, more important, [impede construction of transcendent
emancipatory theories]{.mark}. Despite the pressures of cultural
encroachment and cultural imperialism, however, [indigenous
communities]{.mark} continue to evolve as sites of political
contestation and cultural empowerment. They manage to [survive]{.mark}
the dangers of [colonialist forces by employing proactive strategies,
which emphasize]{.mark} education, [empowerment, and self-determination,
and]{.mark} defensive [tactics that protect against]{.mark} unfettered
economic and political [encroachment]{.mark}. Thus, whatever else the
borders of indigenous communities may or may not demarcate, they
continue to serve as potent geographic filters of all that is
non-Indian---dividing between the real and metaphoric spaces that
differentiate Indian country from the rest of whitestream
America.]{.underline}**

### Queer Theory

#### The AFF's conception of "queerness as transgression" presumes a foundational whiteness which privileges fluidity, ability, and mobility at the expense of racialized peoples. This upholds an individualist liberal humanism complicit with capitalism and American exceptionalism.

**Puar 7** \[Jasbir K., Associate Professor of Women\'s & Gender Studies
at Rutgers University, *Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer
Times*, 2007, p. 21-24\]

Some may strenuously object to the suggestion that [[queer
identities]{.underline}]{.mark}, like their \"less radical\"
counterparts, homosexual, gay, and lesbian identities,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[implicated in]{.mark} ascendant white
[American nationalist formations]{.mark}, preferring to see queerness as
singularly transgressive]{.underline} of identity norms. [This [focus on
transgression]{.mark}]{.underline}, however [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
precisely [[the term by which queerness narrates its own sexual
exceptionalism]{.underline}.]{.mark} While we can point to the obvious
problems with the emancipatory, missionary pulses of certain (U.S.,
western) feminisms and of gay and lesbian liberation, queerness has its
own exceptionalist desires: **[exceptionalism is a founding impulse,
indeed the very core of a queerness that claims itself as an anti-,
trans-, or unidentity]{.underline}**. The paradigm or gay liberation and
emancipation has produced all sorts of troubling narratives: about the
greater homophobia of immigrant communities and communities of color,
about the stricter family values and mores in these communities, about a
certain prerequisite migration from home, about coming-out teleologies.
We have less understanding of [[queerness]{.mark} as a biopolitical
project]{.underline}, one that both [[parallels]{.mark} and intersects
[with]{.mark} that of [multiculturalism]{.mark}, the ascendancy of
whiteness, and may collude with or collapse into liberationist
paradigms]{.underline}. While [liberal underpinnings]{.underline} serve
to constantly recenter the normative gay or lesbian subject as
exclusively liberatory, these same tendencies [[labor to insistently
recenter the normative queer subject as an exclusively transgressive
one]{.underline}]{.mark}. Queerness here is the modality through which
[\"freedom from norms\" becomes a regulatory queer ideal that demarcates
the ideal queer]{.underline}. Arguing that \"more reflection on queer
attachments might allow us to avoid positing assimilation or
transgression as choices,\" Sara Ahmed notes, \"[[The idealization of
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}, or transformation of movement into a
fetish, [[depends on the exclusion of others who are already positioned
as not free in the same way]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"55 [Individual
freedom becomes the barometer of choice in the valuation,
and]{.underline} ultimately, [regulation]{.underline}, [of
queerness]{.underline}. Ahmed\'s post-Marxian frame focuses on the
material, cultural, and social capital and resources that might delimit
\"access\" to queerness, suggesting that queerness can be an elite
cosmopolitan formulation contingent upon various regimes of mobility.
Ironically, [\"[those that have access\" to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}such [[cultural capital and material resources may constitute
the very same populations that many would accuse of assimilation, living
out queerness in the most apolitical or conservatively political
ways]{.underline}.]{.mark} I am thinking of [queerness as
exceptional]{.underline} in a way that [is wedded to individualism and
the rational, liberal humanist subject]{.underline}, what Ahmed denotes
as \"attachments\" and what I would qualify as deep psychic registers of
investment that we often cannot account for and are sometimes best seen
by others rather than ourselves. **[\"Freedom from norms\" resonates
with liberal humanism's authorization of the fully self-possessed
speaking subject, untethered by hegemony or false consciousness, enabled
by the life/stylization offerings of capitalism, rationally choosing
modern individualism over the ensnaring bonds of family]{.underline}**.
[In this problematic definition of queerness, individual agency is
legible only as resistance to norms rather than complicity with them,
thus equating resistance and agency]{.underline}. Both Saba Mahmood and
Ahmed critique this conflation and redirect their attention to agency
that supports and consolidates norms, but even this turn presupposes
some general universal understanding of what counts as norm, resistance,
and complicity. As Mahmood asks, \"\[Is it\] possible to identify a
universal category of acts---such as those of resistance---outside of
the ethical and political conditions within which such acts acquire
their particular meaning?\"56 [[The rhetoric of freedom
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also of course [[a mainstay in philosophies of
liberal democracy and is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[a foundational
tenet of American exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. But finally,
[[queerness as transgression]{.underline}]{.mark} (which is one step
ahead of resistance, which has now become a normative act) [[relies on a
normative notion of deviance, always defined in relation to normativity,
often universalizing.]{.mark} Thus deviance, despite its claims to
freedom and individuality, is ironically cohered to and by regulatory
regimes of queerness---through, not despite, any claims to
transgression]{.underline}. While Ahmed also looks to queerness as a
challenge predominantly to heteronorms, queer theorists such as Cathy
Cohen implicate queer politics in an intersectional model that should
also ideally challenge race and class norms as they intersect with
heteronorms.57 Other queer theorists might articulate queerness as a
poststructuralist endeavor that deconstructs not only heteronorms, but
the very logic of identity itself. In the first version of queerness,
[resistance to heteronorms may be privileged in a way that effaces the
effects of this resistance in relation to possible complicities with
other norms, such as racial, class, gender, and citizenship privileges.
Queer intersectional analyses challenge this regulatory queerness, but
in doing so]{.underline} may fail [to subject their own frames to the
very critique they deploy. In this]{.underline} second [formulation,
queer of color]{.underline} and queer immigrant
[communities]{.underline} (not to mention queer of color critique) [are
always beyond reproach, an untenable position given the]{.underline}
(class, religious, gender-queer, national, regional, linguistic,
generational) [tensions within, among, and between queer diasporic,
immigrant, and of color communities]{.underline}, thus [obfuscating any
of their own conservative proclivities]{.underline}. Conversely,
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[holds queer of color organizing and
theorizing to impossible standards]{.underline}]{.mark} and
expectations, always [[beholden to spaces and actions of resistance,
transgression, subversion]{.underline}.]{.mark} In the last instance,
[all (of one\'s) identities]{.underline} (not just gender and sexual)
[must be constantly troubled, reading to an impossible transcendent
subject who is always]{.underline} already [conscious of the
normativizing forces of power and]{.underline} always [ready and able to
subvert, resist, or transgress them. [It is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}precisely [[by denying culpability or assuming that one is not
implicated in violent relations toward others]{.underline},]{.mark} that
one is outside of them, [[that violence can be perpetuated.
Violence]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially of the liberal varieties,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} often most [[easily perpetrated
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[spaces and places where its possibility
is]{.underline}]{.mark} unequivocally [[denounced]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### The fetishization of difference ironically collapses into a singular sameness, as the dominant culture's white supremacy comes to regulate queerness into an ideal. This works to mystify racial and colonial violence, furthering marginalizing people of color.

"You Can Have My Brown Body and Eat It, Too!" *Social Text* 23.3/4
(Fall/Winter 2005): 171-191\]

The category \"Latino,\" used as a racial descriptor rather than a
political affiliation, is nearly as vague as \"brown.\" Consider, for
example, how easily \"Latin\" (or for that matter, \"Spanish\" and
\"Hispanic\") may substitute for \"Latino.\" However, most uses of
\"Latina/o\" disregard the politics of that ambiguity, together with the
differences that the category itself already collapses. Remarkably,
queer theory understands the politics of difference as fundamental to
its practice, yet it can participate in the circulation of categories
like \"Latin\" without appreciating in the least its function within a
complex web of identifications and desires. While the variations on the
category \"Latina/o\" collapse innumerable differences, queer theorizing
seems for the most part quite content to let that sameness alone.
[\"[Queer\" needs to interrogate its own investments in
sameness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ironically, [these investments deploy the
rhetoric of difference precisely so that the presumed anti-identity of
queer might dissimulate profiting by sameness]{.underline}. By this
means, [[establishmentarian queer theory has colluded in rendering
material and psychic violences of racialization
unintelligible]{.underline}.]{.mark} I agree that [communities are bound
by fictions, but that does not diminish the violences enacted in
constituting those communities. Queer theory has exchanged]{.underline}
too hastily [the politics of identity for the politics of difference.
[To combat oppression it is necessary to theorize how communities are
bound by shared]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}fantasies and [desires, in
other words, how they are bound at some level by sameness. This is
especially crucial where sameness makes itself transparent, as it does
with whiteness]{.underline}. Sometimes, people are not so different from
one another. [[Queer theory, when it privileges difference over sameness
absolutely, colludes with institutionalized racism in vanishing, hence
retrenching, white privilege. **It serves as the magician\'s assistant
to whiteness\'s disappearing act.**]{.underline} ]{.mark}Hanson
acknowledged that he had anticipated my response and had heard exactly
the same protest before. Oddly, these repeated protests only invalidate
one another. I should in fact feel shamed at this revelation of the
commonplace nature of my thinking. Hanson\'s accusation constitutes a
defensive posture, a way to dismiss criticism. However, I think the
solace I received (much of it from white lesbian theorists) may
similarly indicate a form of defensiveness. I absolutely experienced
solidarity with white lesbian theorists at the conference, but there was
also from some an expression of solace that I think masqueraded (and
only just barely) as solidarity.231 am sure that reactions to the
dispute between Hanson and me had to have been more complicated than the
(apparent) polarization, the taking of sides that occurred after the
final roundtable. But I also wonder if that\] (apparent) polarization
did not in fact need to happen to preserve the status quo, to further
bind queer theory\'s white indivisibility. As I alternately inhabited
the body of an intransigent and vulgar savage as well as that of a noble
one (depending on where you sat), as I performed my brownness---and what
choice did I have really, fated to my performance of the unsophisticated
and banal---I understood the rupture I witnessed as one that needed to
happen in order to fortify that white body of queer theory, to
strengthen its immunity against foreign agents. I did experience genuine
intellectual engagement with colleagues. Otherwise, I would not waste my
energy formulating this critique. However, that engagement was subsumed
by a reductive polarization; like the brown body (poor Mario\'s,
Kiko\'s, my own, and, most important, the brown body missing in action),
it was an obligatory sacrifice to the status quo of Gay Shame\'s queer
theorizing. Although the ironies of Ellis Hanson\'s presentation were
lost on me, I was keenly aware of another much crueler irony. The brown
body in his schoolboy uniform, invited into the university classroom of
a cosmopolitan gay male fantasy for a game of show and tell, remains
simultaneously shut out of the university classroom. Increasingly, [the
brown body finds itself expelled from civil society---if not expelled
outright from the nation]{.underline}. Seeing Kiko up on the screen, his
dick hanging out of his khaki shorts, made the absence of gay men and
lesbians of color at the conference all that much more pronounced. [The
brown body is variously sacrificed at the exigencies of white privilege
and white desire]{.underline}. As peculiar as this may sound, [[I am not
convinced that institutionalized forms of queer theory really care to
investigate desire]{.underline}]{.mark}. An established group of queer
theorists remain quite riled, understandably, about the normalization of
queer. However, [[queer theory resists the critique of its
own]{.underline}]{.mark} even more [[alarming normalizations. The
dominant queer culture, like any dominant culture, demands assimilation.
Queer theory does not want]{.underline}]{.mark} to be normalized, but
neither does it want [[to be queered.]{.mark} Unruly subjects are
expelled to its margins]{.underline}. This expulsion is telling.
Establishmentarian [[queer theory]{.mark}, despite its]{.underline}
oft-professed [revulsion at mass culture assimilation,
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}also quite [[comfortably settled
at]{.underline}]{.mark} the center or, rather, [[that comfortably
furnished space just left of center]{.underline}]{.mark}. We would be
deluded to think that queer theory is not invested in protecting the
institutional structures that have accommodated it, including, most
significantly, white patriarchal structures of knowledge. This does not
call for abandoning the field but rather for greater vigilance,
imagination, and accountability, as well as a reinvigorated inquiry into
the complex trajectories of desire and identity.

#### The 1AC is emblematic of settler environmentalism which is the attempt to redeem their position by restoring the Commons- this then begs the question of whether or not there should be a Commons at all

[[Settler environmentalism describes efforts to redeem the settler as
ecological, often focusing on settler identity and belonging through
tropes of Indigenous appropriations]{.underline}]{.mark} [-- returning
to the wildman or demigoddess, claiming of one's natural or 'native'
self and thus the land, again. For example, 'off the grid' does not
describe a place, but a set of redemptive behaviors -- it [is a terra
nullius imaginary of a some- where, nowhere, neverplace where one is no
longer a settler]{.mark}]{.underline}. In using [the term [settler
environmentalism]{.mark}, I am deliberately ambiguous about critical
environmentalisms, such as [movements in eco-feminism, deep ecology, and
antiracist environmental jus- tice]{.mark}.]{.underline} These are
important trajectories in critical scholarship and activism around
environmental justice, and ought to inform any decolonizing framework[.
[However, antiracist, feminist, and environmental justice work are not
automatically the oppo- site of settler colonialism. Decolonization
might be incommensurable with projects more generally thought as social
justice (]{.mark}see Tuck and Yang 2012). ¶]{.underline} In the previous
ethnographic example, greening the ghetto can mask a neoliberal
curriculum of whitening9 the ghetto with 'better-educated,' ecologically
'responsi- ble,' global citizens. More radical environmentalisms can
also uphold the settler fan- tasy of sacred 'wilderness' -- another form
of unpeopled land -- that must be restored or preserved. Even **[the
progressive concept of land as Commons to be occupied, collectively
shared and stewarded, may require the negation of Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}**. 'The people still speak of the sacredness of
places now claimed by the parks ser- vices for instance' (Goeman 2008,
32). **[[Occupying land for the Commons assumes that all prior, indeed
current as well as future relations between people and land are null and
void.]{.mark} 'In other words,' writes Sandy Grande, 'both Marxists and
capitalists view land and natural resources as commodities to be
exploited, in the first instance, by capitalists for personal gain, and
in the second by Marxists for the good of all']{.underline}** (2004,
27). **[[Social justice endeavors all take place on Native]{.mark}
land]{.underline}**. In this vein, I now turn to the Occupy movement. ¶
Behind every great American city is a great crime. Oakland was founded
on occupation and land theft. In 1850, a coterie of Yankee businessmen
began building a port in what would become Oakland's Jack London Square,
developing and selling land unbeknownst to landlord Luis Peralta, who
was granted 48,000 acres for his service to the Spanish army. Indeed,
the Native Ohlone still lived in the land 'owned' by the Peraltas, as
well as Miwok and other Indigenous people who had migrated as a result
of historic relationships between tribes and efforts to escape the
Mission system. The Peraltas sued, and in 1856, the US Supreme Court
upheld their claim, but maintained that it was too late to reverse -- as
deeds and titles had exchanged hands so many times that there was no
undoing -- and because Oakland was now occupied. ¶ Occupy Oakland, which
began in October of 2011, was an active part of the movements that began
with Occupy Wall Street. Occupy itself was a diverse set of movements
and dialogues not reducible to a single name or a campaign. Various
queer, people of color and Indigenous groups participated in or
sympathized with Occupy and recognized its importance as a meeting
space, a node, for struggle. However, many of these groups had serious
points of difference, most notably in the problematic name, 'Occupy.' ¶
On 28 October 2011, a group of Indigenous and non-Native
intellectuals/activists introduced 'The Memorandum of Solidarity with
Indigenous Peoples' at the General Assembly of Occupy Oakland. ¶
WHEREAS, those participating in 'Occupy Oakland' acknowledge that
Oakland is already occupied land; Oakland being the historical territory
of the Chochenyo Ohlone people; and \... ¶ RESOLVED, that those
participating in 'Occupy Oakland' seek the genuine and respectful
involvement of indigenous peoples in the rebuilding of a new society on
their ancestral lands; and As a signal to the national 'Occupy Wall
Street' movement and the indigenous peoples here and there who have felt
excluded by the colonialist language of occupation used to name this
movement, it shall be declared that 'Occupy Oakland' aspires to
'Decolonize Oakland' -- to 'Decolonize Wall Street' -- with the guidance
and participation of indigenous peoples; ¶ [The memorandum points to
difference as a modality of organizing, a source of strength and
political possibility rather than as simply a curtailment of common
struggle. Most importantly, the memorandum makes explicit the moral and
political leadership of Indigenous peoples in any decolonial effort in
North America]{.underline}. Signifi- cantly, the first signature of
memorandum is by Chochenyo Ohlone educator Corrina Gould. ¶ The
memorandum was passed, but not without controversy. One of the signers,
Joanne Barker (Lenape) posted in her blog, Tequila Sovereign, that
several people approached the group with serious anxieties about
decolonization. ¶ [Ultimately, [what they were asking is whether or not
we were asking them, as non- indigenous people, the impossible? Would
their solidarity with us require them to give up their lands]{.mark},
their resources, their ways of life, so that we -- who numbered so few,
after all -- could have more?]{.underline} Could have it all? ¶ And
**[[this is the rub about decolonization: it forces people to confront
their complicity in settler colonialism and the ongoing violence of
empire]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It **[immediately unsettles the utopian
vision of wealth redistribution and collectively owned
Commons]{.underline}**. It exposes how numerical the conceptualization
of social justice remains -- the 99% is a 'deserving' supermajority that
renders Indigenous peoples (a super-minority) completely illegible.
Barker goes on to write, ¶ I have a dream that the people of 'Occupy
Oakland' will not see the affirmation of indigenous peoples' rights to
self-government, territorial restoration, and cultural auton- omy as a
threat to their own; that they will see solidarity with indigenous
peoples as an affirmation of their humanity and justice. ¶ [Barker's
assertion reflects how 'sovereignty' as an Indigenous word is spoken
with a different inflection than its cousin in the settler nation's
lexicon.]{.underline} It echoes the questions posed by Watson, writing
from an aboriginal Australian perspective: ¶ Is aboriginal sovereignty
to be feared by Australia in the same way as Aboriginal peo- ple fear
white sovereignty and its patriarchal model of the state -- one which is
backed by power or force? Or is aboriginal sovereignty different \...
for there is not just one sovereign state body but hundreds of different
sovereign aboriginal peoples. Aboriginal sovereignty is different from
state sovereignty because it embraces diversity, and focuses on
inclusivity rather than exclusivity. (Watson 2007, 20) ¶ A little over a
month later, another proposal came before the General Assembly -- to
change the movement's name to Decolonize Oakland. This time, the
proposal did not pass. Christine Cordero (who does not identify as
Native) posted on Facebook a few of her responses to the arguments made
against the name change, including 'Decolonize is divisive.' To which
she responded, 'Occupy is divisive already and not including whole
swaths of people. Decolonize and liberate are TRANSFORMA- TIVE.
Difference, diversity, and change aren't divisive.' ¶ Occupy Oakland
means to Occupy Ohlone. Because Ohlone is both people and land/place
simultaneously, you cannot occupy Oakland without also trespassing on
the bodies and spirits of those who live/d there. [[Land is 'more than a
site upon which humans make history or as a location that accumulates
history]{.mark}']{.underline} (Goeman 2008, 24), [[more than a site to
occupy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Settler Fragility

#### **Settler fragility is systemic and forces ethnic groups to be indoctrinated with messages of a false community of national pride which distracts peoples from the idea that this very process takes place on land unbelonging to those people. Settler colonialism is based on the belief that one culture is supreme to another and deserves the land which indigenous peoples inherently own.**

[[Settler fragility stems from settler privilege, which is similar to
white privilege in that it is systemic, structural, and based on white
supremacy,]{.mark} making it difficult to identify.]{.underline} Only in
some ways, settler privilege is far more covert and cunning. The reason
is because of the ubiquitous ways the US is normalized; that is, the US
settler state is the "water we swim in." [US citizens of all races and
ethnic groups have been indoctrinated their entire lives with messages
designed to foster a sense of national pride and belonging in the making
of what has been called an "imagined community," which always occurs on
Indigenous lands. Their [citizenship and their very identity are taken
for granted without critical consciousness about the US's contradictory
foundational structures and narratives.]{.mark} Settler colonialism is
said to be a structure, not an historic event, whose endgame is always
the elimination of the Natives in order to acquire their land, which it
does in countless seen and unseen ways.]{.underline} [These techniques
are woven throughout the US's national discourse at all levels of
society. [Manifest Destiny]{.mark}---that is, the US's divinely
sanctioned inevitability---[is like a computer program always operating
unnoticeably in the background. In this program, genocide and land
dispossession are continually both justified and denied.]{.mark} [Like
white fragility, settler fragility is the inability to talk about
unearned privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}---in this case, the privilege of
living on lands that were taken in the name of democracy through
profound violence and injustice. [[Like white privilege, white supremacy
is also at the root of settler fragility]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
difference is that foreign invasion, dispossession of Indigenous lands,
and genocide were based on (white) European religious and cultural
supremacy as encoded in the doctrine of discovery, not racial supremacy.
And, unlike for other people of color who have made significant legal
gains in the US legal system, the nearly two-centuries-old doctrine of
discovery is at the foundation of the legal system that still
paternalistically determines Native lives and lands. [[Settler privilege
thus simultaneously implicates and is beyond racism]{.mark}, which is
one reason why, paradoxically, [even non-Native people of color can
experience a type of privilege and fragility]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Fragility stems from the need to distance oneself from complicity in
settler colonialism, in what some scholars have called "settler moves to
innocence."]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The good-bad binary is part of this
distancing impulse, because like racism, nobody wants to be associated
with genocide and injustice]{.mark}, [especially in a country that touts
its democracy and equality, and especially for people who have been
oppressed by it in other ways.]{.mark}]{.underline} But compared to
white privilege, this is what makes settler privilege so much more
beguiling and difficult: [it cuts to the core of American identity in
all its iterations, subtly calling into question the legitimacy of the
US and the sense of belonging on the land.]{.underline} Here are [[some
of the ways settler fragility can be seen in all
ranges]{.underline}]{.mark} of the political spectrum. On the liberal
end [[we see]{.underline}]{.mark}: "[[I love]{.underline}]{.mark}
~~Indians~~ [[(Natives)and]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~Indian~~ [[(Native)
culture. I believe I have Native ancestry somewhere in my family
tree]{.mark}"]{.underline} (I have been oppressed, too, even though I'm
white). "Even though the ~~Indians~~ didn't deserve what we did to them,
[[the damage is done and there is nothing we can do]{.mark} to right the
wrongs]{.underline} that have been done to them" (We should all move on
and forget the past, and ~~Indians~~ should get beyond their
victimization). "[[We are all one people now]{.underline}]{.mark}" (The
settler state and all its attendant privileges must prevail). "I am a
person of color and am subject to racism, so I don't have settler
privilege" ([[I have no reason to be accountable to settler colonialism
since I am oppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}, too). "[[Since I am poor and
don't own any land]{.mark}, [I don't have settler
privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}." In the middle we see: "Neither I or my
ancestors killed anyone to be here" ([[my people are not to
blame]{.underline}]{.mark}). "We can't apply the standards of today to
the behavior of our (European) ancestors" ([evasion of
accountability]{.underline}). "Most Native American people have white
ancestry" (that means they are complicit in settler colonialism, too;
[[if everyone is to blame, then no one is to
blame]{.underline}]{.mark}). On the right end of the spectrum:
"~~Indians~~ (Natives) were all killing each other anyway when Europeans
got here" ([[they were uncivilized savages anyway]{.underline}]{.mark}).
"I'm a 'native' American because I was born here"
([[American]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~Indian~~ [[(Native) history is
irrelevant]{.mark}, and the settler state prevails]{.underline}). [[It's
important to emphasize that like white privilege, settler privilege is
systemic, so just denying that one doesn't possess it doesn't mean one
isn't complicit in it]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is about deeply
questioning all the assumptions we have been raised with in a society
built on imperialism, private property (which includes slavery), and
capitalism. Even for Native people who don't live in their ancestral
homelands, the questions need to be asked: who are the original people
of the place where I live, and what are my responsibilities to them?
Here's how some of these ideas apply in my own life, which are vexing
and uneven but do not relieve me from accountability. I am of mixed
European and Native ancestry. A phenomenon I have been exposed to
throughout my life is the minimization of my Nativeness by others in
order to emphasize my Europeanness ("you're not a real
~~Indian~~(Native)"). However, my non-Native ancestry does not cancel
out the ways my Indigenous ancestors were victimized by the genocidal
policies of the US, nor has it shielded me from inheriting the negative
impacts of that history. At the same time, I was born and raised outside
my Native community due to the policies of forced assimilation my mother
and her ancestors were subjected to; I live in the Native American
diaspora. This means that as long as I don't live in my ancestral lands,
even though I am Native, I am still a guest in someone else's homelands
(currently the lands of the Acjachemen Nation in Southern California).
Based on the way I look I have a degree of skin privilege, so I rarely
experience overt racism. On the other hand, as a mixed-blood Native
person, due to colonial processes of erasure and prevailing stereotypes,
I cannot be seen by dominant society for who I am as an "authentic"
member of my group. This is extremely complex terrain, and there are
many shades of grey depending on a person's own ancestral origins. But
[[the most important point is that this is a structural, societal
issue]{.mark} [to which we each have an individual relationship]{.mark}.
[The central question is: what is our relationship to place, and what
processes have granted and/or denied us privilege in
it?]{.mark}]{.underline} [To unsettle settler privilege, [we need to
accept that we have responsibilities]{.mark} not only to the land we
live upon, but to the Native community of that place in order to be good
relatives, accomplices, and tenants.]{.underline}

### Violence

**Settler colonial sovereignty creates endless violence that solidifies
a world with no future away of violence -- war, famine, massacre,
starvation, disease and genocide**

Okay so in the state of nature, which Hobbes defines as a place where
there\'s no security, there is, in Edelman\'s terms, no future. This is
true not only because we are responsible solely for our own survival, an
endeavor we cannot possibly succeed at on our own, but it is also
because given this radical insecurity, we are incapable of imagining any
other moment or time than now. Hobbes himself acknowledges there is no
\"accounting of time\" in the state of nature, which of course makes
sense; in a condition of perpetual war, the future is unimaginable
because it is so tenuous. As well, the past becomes effectively
irrelevant, hence the institution of sovereignty in Hobbes\' version
secures our physical preservation and I'm arguing that it does so by
bringing temporality itself into existence and producing a future. Okay,
so that\'s the first point. The second point is that, in this act, the
sovereign establishes the very meaning and content of life itself. For
understood temporally, there is a way in which there is no distinction
between life and death in the state of nature, in so far as there is no
way to tell present from future. The state of nature\'s enduring present
entails that life there is a kind of limbo-like existence, a suspension
of living or perpetual near-death experience wherein we can never be
certain of anything. This may be why it is so important to Hobbes to
establish the commonwealth in the first place: Not simply to preserve
life, as he explicitly suggests, but actually more primarily to
definitively demarcate life as life and differentiate it from death. I
mean, there\'s a normative enterprise going on here, right? Indeed,
although the sovereign is the beacon of peace, war and death are just as
must a byproduct of the institution of sovereignty as life and peace
are. So what I take from this is that sovereignty, in short, is the
definitive bio-political regime, in so far as it constitutes and
determines life as such, distinguishing it from what only becomes
subsequently recognizable as death. The third point is that
[[sovereignty institutes]{.mark} this [life-death distinction via a
moralized logic that relegates life to the domain of civilization and
value, and death to the domain of savagery and
nihilism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This becomes clear in the conflicted and
confusing ways Hobbes characterizes the state of nature as
simultaneously a time, a place, and a condition. Now as I just argued
that the state of nature is a time --- like if it is an era or an epoch
--- it\'s a time with no time, a moment that is completely timeless, an
era lacking any dynamism or principle of change. If the state of nature
is instead a condition, which he also claims, he is clear that it is one
of savagery, writing \"It may peradventure be thought there never was
such a time nor condition of war as this; and I believe it was never
generally so over all the world, but there are many places where they
live so now,\" and he cites as an example, \"the savage people in many
places of America.\" Bolstering the view that the state of nature is a
story about humanity\'s pre-history, Hobbes here rehearses the
enlightenment trope of indigenous peoples as European humanity\'s
ancestors and/or pre-modern childhood. Savagery is, therefore,
associated with solid temporality, timelessness, and the failure of
forward movement or progress. Conclusively, when referencing a
geographical location, the state of nature is America, and the
17th-century European notion of the new world, an empty land ripe for
exploration and conquest. These specifications of the state of nature in
Hobbes make clear that establishment of sovereignty imposes a clear
distinction not simply between peace and war, life and death, but also
between modernity and backwardness, civilization and savagery. Each of
these categorical pairs functions as a surrogate for the others. Taken
together, they suggest the deep implications of the categories of life
and death with colonization and conquest for European politics and
political theory. The fourth point is that the commonwealth, or
sovereign or sovereignty, can\'t actually solve the problem Hobbes says
it does. So if there\'s no state and we\'re all going to murder each
other, the solution is obviously a really big bad, coercive state,
right? And that\'s going to solve the problem? It can\'t solve the
problem, and that\'s because it can\'t solve the problem of desire,
which has futurism built into its very structure. Hobbes actually gets
short shrift as a psychologist. He actually talks quite a bit about
desire and affect. So desire, according to Hobbes, is a voluntary motion
of the body, whose aim, regardless of object, is attainment ---
possession, consumption, enjoyment. Yet this attainment poses a dilemma,
for as he says, the aim of desire is \"not to enjoy once only and for
one instant of time, but to assure forever the way of one\'s future
desire.\" According to Hobbes, in other words, desire seeks perpetuity
of enjoyment. It aims at a consumption that can never fully completed.
The fifth point --- we\'re almost done --- is that Hobbes asserts,
therefore, that human beings are perpetual power-seekers, not because we
want more and more, but because we want to preserve what we have now
forever. His claim is that mere maintenance of the present requires
accumulation, undertaking a perpetual reference to an unknown future.
Thus, even despite the security from physical violence the sovereign
provides, he cannot alleviate the anxiety that runs apace with desire.
Everything we do today is undertaken for the sake of a future, which, if
we\'re successful, will be no different from the present. But the
sovereign can\'t guarantee that, right? Sixth then, and finally, this
means that Hobbes\' colonial story of the emergence of life and death
from the state of nature is based on an underlying logic of desire that
explains why settler colonial societies transform into expansionist
security states. Hobbes\' understanding of desire and its dilemmas
elaborates George W. Bush\'s doctrine of preemptive warfare, the logic
of Israeli self-defense in the face of so-called \"existential
threats,\" and the rationale behind stand-your-ground laws that
exonerated the murderer of Trayvon Martin. The fact of this logic\'s
hegemony in economics and political science as rational-choice theory or
in international relations as Big R Realism make clear that futurist
temporality is the unquestioned philosophical foundation of the U.S.
economic and political order, as well as the obviously imperial
investments of these economic disciplines. In short, it is the
temporalization of desire itself that explains both the settler colonial
foundations of survival, life and the value of life, as well as its
transformation into an expansionist imperial project. Okay, that was
part one. Part two: settlement and the global war on terror. So how does
this reading of Hobbes through Edelman help us understand the emergence
of empire? Lorenzo Veracini has argued that **[[settler colonialism is
distinct from other types of colonialism]{.mark} in so far [as it seeks
to erase itself]{.mark} as settler colonialism]{.underline}**. Following
Patrick Wolf\'s argument that settler colonialism pursues a logic of
elimination, whereby settlers seek to replace the native and indigenize
themselves post-facto, Veracini argues that because it aims at the
elimination of the native, settler colonization necessarily aims at its
own elimination. The truly successful settler colonial project, then,
would therefore efface the native entirely, whether through genocide or
assimilation or some other form of disappearance, the politics of
recognition as Glen Coulthard has recently argued. Unless and until
elimination is accomplished, settler states will engage in all sort of
contortions, both political and ideological, to obscure the native in
order to naturalize the conquest. Veracini represents this future of
settler colonialism as either conceptually embedded its definition or
else as a kind of bad faith on settlers\' part, potentially implying
that a guilty conscience somehow seeks to ward off complicity with
conquest. I think that Edelman\'s understanding of futurism, however,
helps explicate just how and why this anxious, reiterative, and
reactionary veiling impulse is definitive of bio-political sovereignty.
Hobbes\' narratization of the drive of the state of nature is, like any
other narratization of the drive, an imposition and thus an explicitly
ideological move that serves a particular political agenda. It is the
specifically futurist character of this imposition that destines it for
failure and thus explains its anxious and recursive structure. Edelman
regards this narrative movement toward a viable political future as
fundamentally fantasmatic, not to mention conservative and ideological.
Futurism, in other words -- and these are his words --- \"perpetuates
the fantasy of meaning\'s eventual realization,\" a realization that is
by definition impossible, in so far as it is always only ever to come.
Right? That\'s what the future is: It\'s beyond our grasp, it\'s always
just out of reach. Built into Hobbes\' understanding of desire, in other
words, is the failed tautology of futurism, which as Edelman instructs,
is fundamentally and futilely political. My contention is that this
constitutive failure of futurism can be understood as the dynamic
content of conquest in settler societies, as the original
civilizationist imposition of temporality, an act that explains their
subsequent transmogrification into expansionist security states. So,
rather than face the violence that brought peace and life itself into
being, Hobbes instead naturalizes this founding act by declaring it to
be a \"general inclination of all mankind\" to engage in what he calls a
\"perpetual and restless desire of power after power that ceases only in
death.\" In other words, he both institutes life and pushes it forward
via a futurist narrativization of the drive into an insatiable,
cumulative desire. Yet while [desire may push us ever forward, ever
beyond the initial moment of settlement, it cannot erase that settlement
or relieve settlers\' sovereignty of conquest]{.underline}. This is
neither because of settler colonialist theoretical definition nor
because settlers secretly feel guilty, but rather because the
impossibility of fulfilling futurism\'s fantastical promises requires
some other way of meeting the needs it manufactures if settler
sovereignty is to maintain itself and it polity in tact. **[[Settler
societies resort to]{.mark} any number of [destructive forms of managing
futurism\'s failing, from transfer and removal to outright extermination
through war, massacre, starvation, and disease]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Yet this anxious reiterative activity is wholly predicable from an
Edelmanian perspective and ineliminable from the structure of settler
sovereignty because the futurist narrativization of the drive has
rendered settlers beholden to an unsustainable temporality that must
produce queerness or death in order to continue to produce meaning,
survival, and civilization for itself. [Settler sovereignty, thus,
cannot do without the death native it brings into being]{.underline}.
**[[The native as death must exist in order to purchase life and
survival for the settle]{.mark}r.]{.underline}** And yet, as Veracini
and Wolf argue, [the native cannot exist if the settler is to indigenize
herself as native to the land she has expropriated, hence the production
of new enemies, new queers, new deathly threats to settlement and its
civilization and its way of life.]{.underline} The settler colonial
foundation of bio-political sovereignty gives way to an expansionist
imperial security state that finds new enemies abroad and new obstacles
to its endless expansion, thereby solving, albeit only ever partially
and temporarily, the problem of futurist failure that constituted
settlement to begin with. **[[purchase life and survival for the
settle]{.mark}r.]{.underline}** And yet, as Veracini and Wolf argue,

### Anti-blackness

**Settler Colonialism erases the identity and culture of black folk.
Colonialism justifies people forcing black bodies to become the perfect,
complicit, republican citizen. The black body can never be completely
free without ending colonialism**

**Asaka 17**

Ikuko Asaka, November 2017, PhD from Madison for Gender and Women's
History, "Tropical Freedom : Climate, Settler Colonialism, and Black
Exclusion in the Age of Emancipation", pages 120 to 124 //jazmyn

Such a vision went beyond the private to the entire refugee population.
Ward advocated the promotion of black settlerhood in his capacity as a
traveling agent for the Anti- Slavery Society of Canada and by writing
opinion pieces in black Canadian newspapers. [As the founding editor of
the Provincial Freeman,31 Ward waged his early campaign to elevate
former- slave mi grants to the status of landowning settlers: "[The
refugees from]{.mark} southern [plantations shall be made
welcome]{.mark} and pointed [to means and]{.mark} mea sures [for]{.mark}
such [improvement]{.mark} and development, [as shall make them in de pen
dent, self- sustaining laborers]{.mark}, [justifying the impartial
freedom]{.mark} they here enjoy, and contributing by their energy and
industry, to the wealth of their adopted country]{.underline}."32
Conscious of the per sis tent antiblack sentiment, Ward also
retroactively attacked the 1849 Western District Council petition,
condemning it as [an insult to "equal fellow subjects" and a barrier to
their rights to "buy and settle upon lands, as have Irishmen, or
Scotchmen, or such men as Mr. Larwill, and his fellow petitioners."33 In
placing black refugees in Canadian settler society, Ward refigured [the
unfavorable repre sen ta tions of fugitive escape by appropriating from
U.S. abolitionist lit er a ture the motif of the courageous male
fugitive slave.]{.mark}]{.underline} Beginning in the 1840s fugitive
slave narratives enjoyed an extensive circulation throughout the U.S.
North as a result of the rapid development of or ga nized abolitionism
in the region. Fugitive slave narratives, both oral and written,
flourished as the northern abolition movement expanded its reach to the
general public, especially through the increased production of
antislavery newspapers and publications and the expansion of lecture cir
cuits. [Fugitive [slaves' narration of]{.mark} their [days in bondage
was expected to lend authenticity to the movement's goal of]{.mark}
immediate [emancipation]{.mark}]{.underline}.34 Especially for formerly
enslaved abolitionists[, [images of escaping slaves were
effective]{.mark} discursive [tools]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [refuting
racist propaganda that slaves were content under slavery]{.mark} and
lacked the capacities necessary for citizenship. Racialized notions of
freedom and citizenship defined black men as lacking the characteristics
essential to a male American republican citizen--- in depen dence,
rationality, courage, patriarchal authority, and love of
liberty]{.underline}. To counter such definitions, former- slave authors
articulated traits of masculine Americanness through the narration of a
slave's movement from slavery to freedom. In these stories, a male
fugitive slave demonstrated resourcefulness and audacity by overcoming
dangers during his escape[. At the core of these formulations was a
nineteenth- century popu lar discourse that grafted manhood and national
identity onto an ability to surmount obstacles while on a
journey]{.underline}. According to the historian Bruce Dorsey, during
the mid- nineteenth century, traveling in the face of difficulties came
to be associated with manliness, Americanness, and whiteness.35 Fugitive
writers deployed this racialized and gendered myth in their effort to
construct a masculine American identity for male slaves.[36 The
appropriation of "the dominant cultural code of manly power and
dignity"]{.underline} enabled Frederick Douglass and others to depict
themselves and their enslaved brothers as equipped with the capacities
of a true American man.37 In this way, [male authors inscribed a
distinctively black form of movement--- slave escape--- with a set of
traits traditionally associated with white male Americans]{.underline}.
Adapting the repre sen ta tional politics of the American slave
narratives, Ward reworked slave escape to Canada as a movement that
required for its successful execution the very attributes of the ideal
settler that white colonists denied in former slaves[. In Ward's version
the characteristics demonstrated by a slave's escape showed male former
slaves' qualifications to be good British settlers: resourcefulness was
translated into industry and enterprise, and risk taking into ardent
love of the British Crown and the freedom granted by it.]{.underline}
The strategic value of Ward's escape narrative was its ability to
produce positive meanings about slave flight by shifting the focus from
the purpose of the migration to its pro cess. [While Larwill's
hierarchical dichotomy drew on the difference between each group's
reason for coming to Canada---to escape or to work---]{.underline} Ward
focused on the mental and physical rigors involved in the pro cess of
slave escape to tether this par tic u lar kind of movement to settler
status. In proving that "the Negro settlers in Canada" were "peaceful
and industrious citizens," Ward scripted a moving male slave figure with
idealized capacities.38 He represented former slaves as better settlers
with greater levels of energy and industry than white immigrants, basing
his argument on the difference in the severity of the two types of
migration: slaves' escape on foot was more physically and mentally
arduous than white immigrants' use of oceanic and ground conveyances. At
one meeting, Ward juxtaposed ["his people who fled from slavery in the
United States" and "immigrants from diff er ent parts of Eu rope" and
explained to the audience that "[the very fact of escaping from slavery"
implied a fugitive's greater physical and mental "energy" compared to
that of "a white man going on board of a steamboat, or in a rail way
car, to travel]{.mark}.]{.underline}"39 Ward took this strategy beyond
the Canadian borders into the British Isles during his trip as an
emissary of the Anti- Slavery Society of Canada to raise contributions
for the relief of former- slave residents.40 After leaving Canada in
April 1853, he toured England and Ireland addressing religious and
missionary organ izations, including the Congregational Union and the
Colonial Missionary Society.41 Some public meetings were also held
specifically for him and his cause, with a committee established solely
to support his fund- raising work in England.42 At one of those
gatherings, [Ward put into full use his male fugitive imagery to show
that "[it required quite a man to escape from slavery" and that those
who succeeded in escaping were so self- reliant and resourceful as to be
"about as good subjects as any that Her Majesty
had]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

### Racialized violence

**Settler Colonialism is the root cause of otherization and racism**

**Nakano 15**

professor of Gender & Women's Studies and Ethnic Studies and Founding
Director of the Center for Race and Gender at the University of
California, Berkeley (Evelyn Nakano, "Settler Colonialism as Structure:
A Framework for Comparative Studies of U.S. Race and Gender Formation,"
Sociology of Race and Ethnicity 2015, Vol. 1(1) 54--74 //jazmyn

[I next turn to **[settler colonial mobilization of race and gender to
manage "exogenous others]{.mark}"** beyond the indigenes and enslaved
blacks.]{.underline} In contrast to virtuous or potentially virtuous
exogenous others (typically European immigrants) who may be selected for
gradual inclusion, [[**undesirable exogenous others**
(**typically**]{.mark} racialized [**immigrants**) **were considered
morally degraded**]{.mark}, sometimes irredeemably so]{.underline}.
Settler colonialism's response to undesirable exogenous others has often
swung (and still does) between the poles of "elimination" and coercive
"exploitation." In making connections between settler colonial treatment
of undesirable exogenous others and the treatment of Native Americans
and African Americans, I am not assuming a commensurability between
anti-black racism or anti-Native American racism and other racisms. The
so-called Afro-pessimist school of thought argues for the singularity of
antiblack racism, which is rooted in the unique conditions of chattel
slavery (Patterson 1985; Sexton 2010, 2011; Wilderson 2010). In his
exegesis of Afro-pessimism, Jared Sexton (2010) contends that despite
the fact that some non-black groups have at times labored under
conditions similar to blacks, they have not been subject to the rule of
slave law. He goes on to argue "the 'social death' in which one is
denied kinship entirely by the force of law, is reserved for the 'natal
alienation' and 'genealogical isolation' characterizing slavery" (Sexton
2010:41). Thus, the analogizing of people of color suffering to black
suffering "bear(s) a common refusal to admit to significant differences
of structural position born of discrepant histories between Blacks and
their political allies, actual or potential" (Sexton 2010:47--48). I
agree that [racisms targeting different groups are not
identical]{.underline} and that different racisms cannot be made
equivalent by drawing analogies between differing forms of
subordination, for example between chattel slavery and labor
exploitation. [However]{.underline}, I do argue that [[the structure of
U.S. settler colonialism rests on social, economic, and political
underpinnings that link racisms]{.underline}]{.mark}. In making the
argument, I eschew constructing or adjudicating a hierarchy of suffering
but work at uncovering some of the underpinnings. [Among the groups that
can be considered under the rubric of "undesirable exogenous others" are
Mexicans and Chinese]{.underline}. They are each single nationality
groups that are often subsumed under broader designations,
Hispanics/Latinos and Asian Americans, respectively. For purposes of
this analysis, I hone in on the specific groups---Mexicans and
Chinese---rather than the broader heterogeneous groupings because of
their long history in the United States and their prominent
representation in popular culture and political-legal discourse. Also
relevant is that the period of [[these groups]{.mark}']{.underline}
initial [[incorporation into the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [coincided with]{.underline} the [westward
expansion]{.underline} [of U.S. settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}
and its project of final elimination of indigenes during the second half
of the nineteenth century. While the category of exogenous other seems
to fit [the Chinese]{.underline}, who [were viewed and treated as
inalterably alien]{.underline}, it may seem incongruent to characterize
Mexicans in that way. But, as Mae Ngai (2004:131-- 32) points out, "When
Anglos confronted Mexicans, they perceived Mexicans as foreigners even
though the majority of the Anglos themselves had also migrated to the
Southwest at the same time. I now turn to examine settler colonialism's
confrontation with Mexicans and Chinese, focusing on the specific
racialization and control strategies aimed at these "undesirable
exogenous others."

### Imperialism impact

#### \*cut Settler colonialism creates imperialism and military violence on nations within capitalism

**Cornellier and Griffiths 16**

and Media, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia,
"Globalizing unsettlement: an introduction", *Settler Colonial Studies*,
Issue Number, 4, 305-312 //jazmyn

This issue of Settler Colonial Studies marks the attempt to think the
global adjacent to and, indeed, constituted in relation to questions of
internal colonialism and settlement. As editors, we implicitly follow a
contention of Scott Morgensen's that settler colonialism is not merely a
violent phenomenon of the colonial periphery, but in fact functions as
constitutive of geopolitics at a global level. As Morgensen puts it,
'**[Settler colonialism directly informs past and present processes of
European colonization, global capitalism, liberal modernity and
international governance]{.underline}**. **[If settler colonialism is
not theorized in accounts of these formations, then its power remains
naturalized in the world that we engage and in the theoretical
apparatuses with which we attempt to explain it.]{.underline}**' 1
[Settler colonialism, then, is not merely a global phenomenon, it is
also constitutive of the global]{.underline}. **[So many nation states
which were founded on settler colonialism are considered first world
nation states, and many are implicated, through this role,
in]{.underline}** b**[roader operations of regional and global
neoimperial control of territory and interests]{.underline}**. This is a
central premise of many of the contributions to this volume, from Kevin
Bruyneel's analysis of the settler colonial vocabulary that animates US
military incursions in the Middle East to Shiri Pasternak's analysis of
the relation between Canadian multi-national private resource extraction
and the ongoing dispossession of native lands in Canada to Mark Rifkin's
careful geopolitical reading of indigenous internationalism in the
United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. If
the USA is the most paradigmatic (though not the sole) instantiation of
global 'capitalist-territorialism' (to use Giovanni Arrighi's phrase),
then as Bruyneel asserts elsewhere 'the persistent reproduction of the
American foundational mythos \[ ... \] serves critically in the
reproduction and legitimation of settler colonialism as a structure',
and does so in the manifest global reach of its neoimperial imprint.2 As
such, 'via the logic of elimination \[ ... \] and dependent upon settler
colonialism America takes up its imperial stance overlooking the world.
This image illustrates that one cannot acknowledge the fact of US empire
without acknowledging settler colonialism, and vice versa'. 3 To cite US
Empire here, as constituted in relation to its own history of internal
(settler) colonialism and manifest destiny is to cite an example of this
relation that might be explored globally. If settler colonialism bears
relation to the global, as the US example illustrates, then global
comparisons of such modes of dispossession also might shed light on the
complexity of specific internal settler colonial experiences. This
issue, then, calls upon scholarship to address the ideologies that
traverse comparable political spaces, of which a number are surveyed in
this issue: Australia, Canada, and Chiapas, Mexico. From the perspective
of a critique of settler colonialism -- which this approach, grounded in
the initial premise of internal colonialism and the idea of elimination,
is uniquely poised to reveal -- what these spaces have in common is a
certain strange double vision surrounding their self-conception. On the
one hand, settler nation states stress their liberalism and inclusivity
and on the other, they aim to either repress indigenous presence and
difference, or, alternately to occlude its particularly salient claims
by subsuming this difference under a wider multicultural settlement on
the management of alterity. Here, the more the modernity and liberalism
of the settler state is rhetorically stressed and pushed, the more it
indulges in the repression of an indigenous presence often imagined as
an anachronistic and aliberal residue of the type of ethnically bound
and territorially fixed political cultures that violently clashed and
sunk in our pre-global and pre-modern world. This is a second crucial
premise of this collection's relation to the globality of settler
colonialism: liberal multicultural policies act comparably across
multiple sites and spaces as avenues for the reinstitution of
dispossession. From Melissa Forbis' analysis of Chiapas to Michael
Griffiths' argument about the relation between race and culture in
Australia, liberal logics are used to conceal new and incipient modes of
dispossession globally. These critical contributions offer us
opportunities to return to the inherently globalizing critical insights
of postcolonial studies, but this time in conversation with recent
developments in indigenous and settler colonial studies. These
complementary fields offer us ways to dialectically connect postcolonial
concerns with movement (conquest, migration, diaspora, displacement, or
return) to the anchoring and immobilizing violence of settlement and
containment. Settler colonial studies emerges not only from a different
academic history than postcolonial studies. The former has also come to
be far more in conversation with indigenous studies than the latter. As
Jodi Byrd's work implicitly registers, this may be due in part to the
relegation of indigenous concerns to the margins of literary area
studies even as postcolonial studies was in ascendance in the 80s and
90s, In North America during this time, it is a great irony that
indigenous concerns engaged far more with American studies than
postcolonial studies. Indeed, the study of national culture is
ironically recognizing the study of indigenous cultures, even as it
implicitly always aimed to contain it. Australian and Canadian national
literary studies in their own ways have similarly been involved in an
attempt at inclusivity that unfortunately still grounds itself in the
settler nation. In the Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand academic
spheres, the experience of colonial subalternity often conflated the
experiences of settler and indigene. In the social sciences, similarly,
indigenous studies as it existed was, until at least the days of the
Writing Culture turn in 1986, predicated on the legacy of anthropology's
fetishization of indigenous peoples as constitutive of the Elementary
Structures of Religious Life (in Durkheim) or constitutive of the human
through the cultural logic of myth and kinship (for instance, in
Levi-Strauss, a notion Mark Rifkin has placed in its particularly
settler colonial context).4 What this brief introduction aims to do is
not to offer a survey of the field. Rather it aims to suggest that this
academic history of in-between-ness is not only the legacy of the
academy -- its vicissitudes, exigencies, and blind spots -- but also
corresponds to a divergent history of internationalism, geopolitics, and
their mechanisms and organelles of recognition and Real-Politik. Briefly
then, let us give an account of the wider institutional mode by which,
in international politics, postcolonial political concerns and those of
indigenous peoples in the settler liberal democracies have (in large
part) departed on two distinct trajectories: one described by
internationalism, the other by relation to a UN mediated discourse of
rights. The latter of these trajectories, culminating in the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of 2007 (UNDRIP), relies
on the enforcement of the very settler nation states that continue to
structure indigenous dispossession in their respective territories. In
1923, Iroquois leader Levi General (best known by his title, Deskaheh)
visited Geneva. The purpose of his visit was to petition the League of
Nations to uphold the claim of the Iroquois Confederacy to nationhood.
Deskaheh's claim was to territory around the banks of Lake Erie, which
had been garnered in a 1784 Treaty with the British -- a treaty ignored
by Canada. Under pressure from Britain, the USA, and Canada, Deskaheh's
petition was ignored by the League. The Bandung Conference 30 years
later saw the decolonizing impetus of Asia and Africa formulated in such
a way as to birth a series of subsequent alternative political and
economic international bodies, most recently the New Asian African
Strategic Partnership (of 2005). Indigenous peoples in North America and
the Antipodes have, of course, evolved their own strategies of political
organization. An alternative internationalism has emerged that
culminated very recently in the 2007 UNDRIP. Yet the limited
enforceability of this international order and its mediation through
signatory settler states bears the legacy of the thwarting of
sovereignty that has been an aspect of mainstream indigenous
internationalism. Within this particular brand of internationalism, the
liberal politics of recognition has dominated indigenous politics and
the very nation states whose imposition many indigenous peoples would
refuse become the brokers of the imperatives symbolically bestowed upon
them by the UN. Settler colonies are strangely exceptional spaces, even
as they are constitutive of global normative world orders. What might
these distinct genealogies of decolonizing thought and political
vicissitude mark? How are we to think indigenous/fourth world
decolonization today, in light of this politics of recognition,
ostensibly international and yet so reliant on the mediation of settler
nation states? Similarly, just as settler nation states can continue to
determine the mode by which they approach the measures mandated by this
new internationalism, they act to maintain the exceptionalism associated
with other settler colonialisms to which their external empires relate.
The creation of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East (UNRWA) is a case in point. The
UN created the UNRWA prior to the 1951 signing of the convention on
refugees, but did not then incorporate Palestinian refugees into the
mainstream system for managing the experience of dispossession and
refuge associated with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
What is it, then, about the archipelago of first world nation states
with settler colonial histories that has come to be associated with the
thwarting of excessive power for the purposes of dispossession and the
reduction of vulnerable bodies, peoples, and populations? It is arguably
their desire and capacity to conceal the dispossession central to their
foundation that has been and continues to be at odds with, exceptional
to, and displaced from their mainstream internationalism. As Patrick
Wolfe has recently remarked: 'settler discourse seeks to shift Native
Affairs out of the realm of international relations and reconstitute it
internally as a depoliticized branch of the welfare bureaucracy'. 5 In
that sense, then, analysis of settler colonialism necessitates the
desire for normative pressure to be placed on the legacies of
elimination and dispossession that characterize particular nation state
in their geopolitical reality, just as it necessitates further
descriptive accounts of the way settler colonialism is one crucial and
constitutive phenomenon undergirding the international order and that of
global economics and geopolitics. If we are to think resistance and
solidarity in relation to the global imperialism engendered by settler
colonialism it might be through a recognition that a multiplicity of
heterogeneous indigenous worlds seeks solidarity against a heterogenous,
though often comparable, array of settler colonial governing practices.
Where settler colonialism is, for instance, always constitutively
biopolitical, where it is also always grounded in political economies of
dispossession, the particular histories of governance that manifest this
dispossession matter. Assimilation and allotment, for instance, are each
biopolitical and each possess a relation to an economics of settler
extraction, but they are not identical. Nor still are the discourses of
sovereignty and self-determination that are deployed in settler public
spheres to articulate within the limitations of the English language
worldings against statist mechanisms of liberal multicultural
recognition, worldings such as: Haudenosaunee, tino rangatiratanga to
name only two. Hence, the attempt here undertaken is to contribute to
the burgeoning conversation around settler colonial studies through an
eclecticism and globalism that might begin to address this question of
comparison. How is the liberal modernity of the settler colonies always
vested in the dispossession of indigenous peoples? How can we also
analyze the distinct modes of biopolitical and state power by which
these dispossessions are deployed? Settler colonialism, as Morgensen
suggests, is constitutive of globality. Yet, Wolfe also insists that
liberal internationalism, under the instrumental pressure of settler
colonial nation states precisely functions by the disavowal of this
geopolitical mode of liberal dispossession. Furthermore, critiques of
globalization must also manage and invest in the question of the
arrivant, as Jodi Byrd (following Barbadian poet Kamau Brathwaite),
names the diasporic subject in the settler colony.6 If diasporic modes
of dispossession have been as much a consequence of globalization as the
settler colonialism that is constitutive of it, then we might
reformulate Morgensen's contention in part: settler colonialism is
constitutive of global Imperialism, though it is not exclusively
explanatory as a way to reckon global modes of dispossession. The first
arrivants of the New World and the antipodes -- from the survivors of
the middle passage to the Asian and South Asian socalled 'Coolie'
laborers used by the British as virtual slaves after formal abolition of
slavery in 1807 -- arrived against their will. Indeed, indigenous
dispossession in relation to settler colonialism has had its own
experience of diaspora, from the trail of tears to the diaspora of more
than 6 million Palestinians from 1948 onwards. As Morgensen notes, 'the
settler colonization of Indigenous Americans, the transatlantic slave
trade, and all colonized indentured labor invoke a global history of
colonial modernity in which Indigenous and African diasporic peoples
appear relationally'. One question that might be implied by this
conjugation is, how might we think the relation of this relational
appearance?7 Might the relation between diaspora and indigeneity, native
and arrivant be thought through intersectional solidarities beyond the
binarism of the settler/native paradigm, while nonetheless continuing to
insist on the sovereignty of indigenous rights to their traditional
territories? We hope that by addressing settler colonialism globally,
the question of diaspora might be made to engage and intersect with it.
While Patrick Wolfe has recently asserted that any disruption of the
binary logic of settler colonialism might itself be a settler logic,
diasporic scholars, and indeed, indigenous scholars attentive to the
condition of the arrivant might disagree.8 Where Wolfe insists that any
fragmentation of the non-indigenous beyond the indigenous-settler binary
merely reifies settler-colonialism, Jodi Byrd insists that we imagine
cacophonously. She writes that \[b\]eyond 'the Manichean allegories of
foreign/native and colonizer/colonized' it is necessary to 'imagine
cacophonously, to understand that the historical processes that have
created our contemporary moment have affected everyone at various points
along their transits with and against empire'. 9 This does not, of
course, mean that we should compromise the fundamental premise of
settler colonialism's status as a structure and not an event that Wolfe
has done so much work to bring to the fore, or the important assertion
of the fact that both the 'settler' and the 'arrivant' experience must
wrestle with the fact that, in Byrd's words, colonialism 'implicates all
those who reside on colonized indigenous lands'. As Byrd notes, this
cacophony 'often coerces struggles ... into complicity with settler
colonialism'. As Elizabeth Povinelli has taught us, the logic of
multicultural recognition asks that indigenous peoples function as the
specter of a late liberal social imaginary that nonetheless serves to
constrain their more substantive political aspirations.10 This is the
case even as 'settlers and arrivants', differently cathect the space of
the native as their home. Settlers, of course, more often than not,
desire and appropriate through imaginaries of racism or indifference.
But our point is to challenge Wolfe's binarism while acknowledging that
to do so is to nonetheless accept that insurmountable salience of
Wolfe's central notion of elimination as the founding premise of settler
colonialism, a notion that, in Byrd's terms 'implicates' all
non-indigenous subjects in settler colonial space. How, we ask, might
the relation between diaspora and indigeneity, native and arrivant, be
thought in a cacophony of solidarity, one that seeks to foreground and
diverge from its so frequent reduction to the hegemonic disavowal of
indigenous presence and sovereignty? To sum up, this introduction
intersects two critical gestures that we find to be paradigmatic of
contemporary indigenous and settler colonial studies: first, we have
attempted to critically unpack what is cultivated as the exceptionality
(or exceptionalization) of the anchoring violence of first world settler
nation states and their locally specific modes of colonial dispossession
and capitalist extraction as they are co-constitutive of global
liberalism; second, we have here attempted to productively tease out the
marginalization of indigenous peoples and indigenous lands from the
globalizing vocabularies of postcolonial theories and diaspora studies.
Each of the articles collected in this special issue of Settler Colonial
Studies offer original interventions into these contemporary fields of
inquiry. In her contribution to this volume, Shiri Pasternak theorizes
'fiscal warfare' as a late stage in a Canadian historical trajectory of
Native dispossession. Fiscal warfare describes acts and policies that
operate with the faintly disguised objective of extending the state's
sovereign claim to full territorial jurisdiction. It undertakes to
obliterate one of the last remaining obstacles standing in the state's
way, namely the remaining fragments of indigenous legal, political, and
economic jurisdiction over their land-base. In this particular case,
populist assumptions about widespread incompetence, corruption, and
reckless spending of public funds on the parts of band councils triggers
governmental imposition of an external, third party management system
taking control of band finances in the name of fiscal responsibility
towards Canadian tax payers. Despite such appeals to 'the public good',
Pasternak insists that this legal strategy reveals a paradigmatic change
in fiduciary governance. The implicit assumption of the strategy is that
the primary beneficiaries of First Nations' financial accountability are
no longer located in the state but instead vested in local and global
private capital. Opening Indigenous land to private industries in order
to feed an international market is a dispossession that results from
capitalism's global inability to face the crisis in resource scarcity
and the exponentially growing cost of resource extraction in a context
in which global consumption is on the rise. As such, for Pasternak, the
new mode of fiscal warfare by which dispossession is accomplished in
Canada is inextricably connected to broader global operations of
capitalist expansion. Pasternak's acute analysis of fiscal warfare in
one particular locale (contemporary Canada as a distinct settler
colonial state) perfectly captures -- and as such also introduces -- the
critical work this collection of essays seeks to accomplish. Her
critical foray into the cunning nature of Canadian settler colonialism
under Stephen Harper's conservative government is most revealing of what
we described earlier as a liberal internationalism moored to the
constant disavowal of the geopolitical specter of dispossession. In the
particular case analyzed by Pasternak, Prime Minister Harper's
dismissive response to Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence's hunger
strike, near the Canadian Parliament's building in 2013, is revealing of
the colonial dispossession that must remain unaddressed for liberal
settler statism to thrive. When the Prime Minister stubbornly refused
Chief Spence request to meet with the heads of the Canadian state as a
condition to end her hunger strike, such refusal suggests that Harper
recognized the sovereign posture embraced by Spence, who thus positioned
herself not as an internally governed subject of the state, but as an
Indigenous leader seeking an audience as an equal in front of -- and
therefore outside -- state sovereignty. By re-inscribing Spence's
requests for funds and respect towards treaty obligations within a
narrative framework of dependency, accountability, and fiscal
(ir)responsibility, Harper effectively sanitized what Pasternak calls
the 'fiscal death' of indigenous communities under third party
management. Once justified in the name of public good via a rhetoric of
economic rationality, this fiscal sentence to death thus increasingly
exposes actual indigenous lives to their own accelerated death by
putting native communities in a permanent state of austerity, despite
these communities' paradoxical footing in a land-base now lawfully open
to a private, capitalist, and globally oriented liberal economy of
resource extraction and primitive accumulation.11 Mark Rifkin's essay
about the UNDRIP is explicitly anchored to such critical intervention in
the politics of liberal internationalism, and thus complements
interestingly Pasternak's local analysis of the contemporary colonial
operations sustaining settler claims to sovereignty and full territorial
jurisdiction. Rifkin, to some extent, 'internationalizes' his earlier
work on Giorgio Agamben and the geopolitics of settler sovereignty,
which appeared in his influential 2009 essay on the 'peculiar' status of
Native people in US law.12 In the 2009 essay, Rifkin explains how Native
peoples represent a 'gap within U.S. legal discourse' 13; they are
neither inside nor outside, even though they remain in practice
subjected to the geopolitical self-evidence of settler sovereignty. If
Agamben's theorization of the state of exception as the primary locus of
sovereign power seems ideal to understand this dialectic of the
inside/outside, Rifkin insists however that Agamben's terms need to be
revised in order to critically accommodate such 'peculiar-ization' of
Natives peoples in US legal discourse. In his contribution to this
volume, Rifkin moves beyond the jurisdictional space of US
territoriality and supplements his inquiry into the limits of Agamben's
critique of sovereignty. He explains how UNDRIP enfolds indigenous
peoples (as non-statist agents) within an internationally enshrined
(even though not legally binding) document that acknowledges the legal
value of the 'difference' of indigenous people as an 'other than'
existing outside the full jurisdictional confine and authority of
discrete sovereign settler polities. In other words, whereas 'Agamben
presumes a coherence between territory and political entity, between the
space of the nation and the governance of the state', UNDRIP imagines
rights that are 'neither encompassed by state regimes nor determined by
state narrative and criteria', thus opening opportunities for the legal
materialization of modes of indigenous peoplehood beyond this peculiar
status as alegal anomalies within state jurisdiction.14 Once again,
Rifkin invites us to re-envision the critical potential of Agamben's
work to indigenous studies, but on the condition that we first revise
his work in light of what constitutes one of its most critical blind
spots: indigeneity and its specific modes of placemaking, which are
predicated on the intrinsic connections between birth and territory,
something that remains unfathomable to Agamben's continental
theorization of sovereign violence as placemaking. In his much-lauded
2007 book The Third Space of Sovereignty: The Postcolonial Politics of
U.S.-Indigenous Relations, Kevin Bruyneel also opened lines of inquiry
about the peculiar status of Indigenous people in US legal discourse. He
explained how indigenous tribes 'straddle the temporal and spatial
boundaries' -- neither inside nor outside -- of American politics.15 In
his contribution to this volume, Bruyneel offers us new insights about
these dual spatial-temporal boundary-making activities of American
statism and liberal colonialism. More accurately, he defines and
theorizes the concept of 'settler memory' as the 'active settler logic
at the core of American collective memory', 16 and a logic that is both
instrumental to the naturalization of settler sovereignty at home, but
also to its global expansion in imperialist violence worldwide. In this
particular essay, Bruyneel explores how famed and feared
nineteenth-century Chiricahua Apache leader Geronimo became a codename
used by the US military in the operation leading to the assassination of
Osama Bin Laden, in Pakistan, in May 2011. Bruyneel explains how the use
of Codename Geronimo captures the temporal boundarymaking activities
that sustain a settler memory that simultaneously sets indigeneity
within and without American politics and history. In this particular
case, Geronimo represents an internal signifier that is amalgamated to
the nation, but also a signifier for a bygone indigenous threat that was
external to the expansion of the USA, and one whose eventual defeat and
subjection to the supremacy of American statism is now projected forward
in time to signify the assassination of another enemy of the state (Bin
Laden), and once again as part of an American imperial intervention
outside or beyond its sovereign (spatial) frontier. This, Bruyneel
explains, is settler memory at work: it invokes settler colonialism
while actively blurring the distinction between past and present, 'thus
further re-inscribing the practices of present day settler violence and
dispossession'. 17 In doing so, Bruyneel offers us a particularly
provocative reading of what would otherwise be conceived as the
exculpatory character of our liberal and multicultural settler
democracies. In such a scenario, the exculpatory rhetoric that drives
many collective expressions of regret about a somewhat sanitized vision
of the colonial past would offer the (post-)settler nation an
opportunity to extinguish the coloniality of a present thereafter
experienced as a selective, willful state of amnesia. On the contrary,
Bruyneel insists that settler memory is not a manner of forgetting; it
is rather a very active and unapologetic form of remembering and
articulating knowledge about both past and present violence. Settler
memory disavows the political relevance of such remembering, and by the
same token disavows the relevance of indigenous people themselves today.
And since settler sovereignty, as Pasternak, Rifkin, and Bruyneel each
argue in their own ways, constitutes an unfinished project (or an
unsettled project), this settler memory is always at work and remains
central to the reproduction and legitimation of settler hegemony, both
at home and its global, imperial reach. Grounded in a different yet
adjacent North-American locale, Melissa M. Forbis's retrospective
analysis of the 20th anniversary of the Zapatistas is exemplary of what
we described earlier as indigeneity's heterogeneous and cacophonous
worldings.

### Heteropatriarchy

**Settler Colonialism naturalizes heteropatriarchal norms in order to
create an ideal, heteronormative group of subjects -- control of
indigenous gender roles and sexuality was key in the settler colonial
project**

Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and
Heteropatriarchy, Feminist Formations, Vol. 25 No. 1 Spring //jazmyn

The first challenge is to problematize and theorize the intersections of
settler colonialism, heteropatriarchy, and heteropaternalism. [**[Native
feminist theories reveal]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} [key aspect o]{.mark}f
the relentlessness of [settler colonialism is the consistency
and]{.mark} thus [naturalization of heteropatriarchy and
heteropaternalism]{.mark}.** [The heteropaternal organization of
citizens into nuclear families, each expressing a "proper," modern
sexuality, has been a cornerstone in the production of a citizenry that
will support]{.mark} and bolster [the nation-state]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Thus, [as [settler nations sought to disappear
Indigenous]{.mark}]{.underline} peoples' [[complex structures]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} government and [kinship]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[the
management of Indigenous peoples' gender roles and sexuality was also
key in remaking Indigenous peoples into settler state
citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, in Canada, the Native
American Act of 1876 regulated the marriage of Indigenous peoples to
confer lines of descent, property, and landholding to men, even though
most societies were matrilineal (Barker 2008; Simpson 2008).
Furthermore, across the United States and Canada, [boarding schools
removed Native children from their families, aiming to]{.underline} both
[sever their ties with their families and home communities and to
destroy the transfer of Indigenous identity, politics, and culture to
the next generations. [The boarding-school process of "kill the Native
American and save the man" attempted to mold Native children into
Western gender roles]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} often also [subjected them to
sexual violence]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 [The imposition of
heteropatriarchy and heteropaternalism does much to interrupt Indigenous
nations' very "sense of being a people]{.underline}" (Smith 2005, 3),
with serious material consequences for Indigenous nations' futures. It
is important to note that in many cases, [the [enforcement of "proper"
gender roles is entangled in settler nations' attempts to limit and
manage Indigenous peoples' claims to land]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
Hawai'i, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 instituted a system
whereby Native Hawaiians of 50 percent "blood" or more would be able to
lease (never own) small plots of land called homesteads from the
government, in lieu of more substantial land rights.7 Because of this
state-authored blood-quantum policy, which remains in effect today with
few revisions, some Native Hawaiians have come to defend the 50 percent
blood definition as the "traditional" standard to be recognized as
Native Hawaiian, despite the fact that Native Hawaiian genealogy has
long been inclusive along both patrilineal and matrilineal lines and
never been solely defined by blood amounts (Kauanui 2008b). As a
consequence, Native Hawaiian women are faced with a particular pressure
to partner with certain Native Hawaiian men in order to possibly produce
children who can still meet the 50 percent blood quantum, and they are
sometimes criticized for failing to "save the race" when they do not
(Arvin forthcoming)Yet, Native Hawaiian women, like other Indigenous
women, do not need to be "saved" from the ways heteropatriarchy and
heteropaternalism have taken root within Indigenous communities. They
are already, and have long been, working toward decolonization within
and beyond their own communities' boundaries. [Many Indigenous women
activists have refused the false binary between fighting for "women's
issues" and fighting for "Native issues," which for Indigenous women are
always coiled together.]{.underline} Suggesting that women's issues
should be left out of Native and other radical forms of nationalisms
(such as black nationalism) or dealt with only after decolonization is
achieved reflects yet another way that heteropatriarchy,
heteropaternalism, and settler colonialism have so deeply shaped
Indigenous communities. [Native feminist theories suggest that actively
decolonizing the very process of decolonization is just as important as
achieving Indigenous communities' political end-goals.]{.underline}

As former students and a professor in, but not of, a U.S. liberal arts
college, we ask whether our current institutions of higher education are
compatible with a project of decolonization. Grounded in our own
testimonios and drawing on a genealogy of Western knowledge, we argue
that U.S. higher education authorizes and perpetrates settler colonial
violence. As such, we find that higher education is not only
incompatible, but irredeemably incommensurable with decolonization.
Furthermore, based on our experiences surviving this violence, we
conclude that the university adapts to inhibit and neutralize
institutional reform that might challenge its coloniality. Based on this
conclusion, we ask ourselves whether we should attempt to transform
higher education or burn it down and start anew. We argue that we do
need to burn it down, and we look to how individuals within the
institution already work towards the development of a new social
structure, one that will outlast and supplant higher education. We
identify three constructive and transformative techniques currently used
for this purpose: survival, empowerment, and (theft by) conversion.
These techniques are a combination of stances towards, relationships to,
and practices within, the institution that build collective futurities
no longer dependent upon higher education. Keywords: Decolonization \|
University \| Higher Education \| Sovereignty \| Violence We three
collaborators, who met while ensnared in a small liberal arts college,
draw upon our lived and felt experiences of that place to argue that the
institution of higher education is an integral site for the reproduction
of settler colonial violence. Weaving together historical analysis, the
ideas of other "criminal" (Moten & Harney 2004) scholars, and our own
testimonios (Acevedo 2001), we highlight ways in which the university
sustains itself in, through, and for coloniality. We contend that [[the
university]{.mark}, as such, can never be unsnarled from its colonial
origin and operation, and [must be destroyed in order to build
educational spaces that support thriving indigenous
communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} To these ends, [we present three
"stances" that may be adopted from within the university and move
towards this alternative vision of education]{.underline}. Of the
authors of this piece, one is the child of Southern rednecks and
Natives, and two of us are from communities of color who settled on
indigenous North American lands. While we have different relationships
to settler colonialism, we were brought together by shared struggles
within the university, which led to a shared desire to see something
else grow in its place. That desire birthed this collaboration of study
and writing, interrogating our responsibilities to both end the M

speak of settler colonialism as that particular imperial violence

For that reason, [settler colonialism is primarily concerned with
territoriality]{.underline} (Wolfe, 2006), [exercising both internal and
external modes of imperialism in order to secure the permanent
occupation of indigenous territory, with the "express purpose of
building an ethnically distinct national community"]{.underline} (Bonds

i.e. the settler state, is defined by and depends upon eliminating
indigenous peoples, seizing and privatizing indigenous lands, exploiting
and containing marginalized peoples in a system of racial
capitalism]{.underline} (Bonds & Inwood, 2016; Gilmore, 2007). These
operations, of what we henceforth describe as [settler colonial
violence, are carried out by the various formal institutions and
informal social systems of the settler state; the murder of indigenous
women, industry-driven environmental genocide]{.underline} (Whyte,
2018), racist border expansion, urban restructuring, [mass
incarceration, and the exploitation and killing of Black people (to name
a few examples), are its evidence.]{.underline} What must be understood
then, is that [settler colonialism is not an isolated historical event,

In order to demonstrate the ways in which higher education performs
settler colonial violence, we draw on secondary historical sources and
critical analyses of the university to chart its evolution and union
with state imperialism. We begin in the early Medieval period, when the
university institution emerged out of the sociopolitical relations of
Western and Southern Europe and established itself as an intellectual
authority. [The Reformation and rise of centralized states, however,
provided for its domestication to local political interests, pushing
knowledge production outside of the university.]{.underline} Lay figures
consequently assumed epistemic responsibility and, in the process,
articulated a new, modern knowledge paradigm, which would eventually be
standardized throughout academia. Mayorga et al. -- Burn It Down: The
Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 90 After the
fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, the classical
education system essentially vanished; academic learning was reduced to
a privilege of Church monks, who devoted themselves to preserving
classical civilization in private seclusion. In subsequent years this
monastic education system concentrated into distinct schools
specializing in medicine, rhetoric, and law, but which still lacked
central authority as well as any scholarly associations that might have
united them (Baldwin & Goldthwaite, 1972). It was the High Middle Ages,
of the 11th -13th centuries, that created the conditions for the
evolution of these schools into the formal university institution and
for the advent of scholastic intellectualism. Both developments can be
traced, in large part, to the plunder and trade returned to Europe by
the Crusades to the Holy Land. This influx of wealth and increased
commercial activity afforded for a renewed urbanism that undermined
prevailing feudal relations. As wealthy urban populations ballooned,
schools began hosting a larger number of masters and students, both
clerical and layperson alike (Baldwin & Goldthwaite, 1972). Masters, for
their part, were increasingly unable to rely upon the Church for a
salary, and students, more often than not foreigners in their place of
study, lacked many political rights and protections under local
government. Therefore, in order to protect these common interests,
students and masters organized themselves into the first universities
during the twelfth century, modeling their associations after both trade
guilds and nascent municipal authorities like the Bolognese commune
(Hyde, 1972). In addition to material wealth, however, Crusaders also
brought back with them scholarly texts, some original works produced in
Islamic centers of learning, others classical Greek and Roman writings
lost in the West, but preserved among the Byzantines and other Eastern
kingdoms. The "discovery" of these texts, which covered topics in
mathematics, astronomy, the natural sciences, ethics, and metaphysics,
disrupted centuries of isolated intellectual development in Europe,
which had extrapolated from and refined a singular body of knowledge.
Attempting to rectify the incongruities between old and new knowledges
consequently revitalized European thought, and university scholars
helmed the elaboration of critical analytic methods, reasoning, and
argumentation which define the high period of scholastic learning and
became the basis of the Western intellectual tradition. Importantly,
this new scholasticism also provided the ideological means by which
universities would expand their own intellectual authority. Growing out
of the monastic education system, early universities considered
themselves to be primarily social institutions, dedicated to the
maintenance of Christian knowledge and faith among the people (Verger,
in Baldwin & Goldthwaite, 1972). Their intellectual authority was,
therefore, restricted to exclusively religious concerns, namely theology
and canon law. Scholasticism, however, broadened academic studies beyond
the religious, allowing university scholars to direct their
investigations towards, and claim expertise over, secular topics. The
university secured legitimacy for this extended authority by cultivating
relations with the state, leveraging their liminal position between
local authorities, regional kingdoms, the Holy Roman Empire, and
ecclesia to establish a degree of autonomy (Baldwin & Goldthwaite,
1972). Local territorial rulers especially turned to universities for
advice in juridical and political matters, with universities in turn
securing legal, economic, and intellectual privileges and exercising a
growing influence over medieval society1 . But, as universities came to
depend upon 1 The University of Paris, for example, was highly
influential in determining the outcome of the 14th century Western
Schism, a largely political rather than theological conflict, through
its advisory role to the Kingdom of France (Verger, 1972). Mayorga et
al. -- Burn It Down: The Incommensurability of the University and
Decolonization 91 territorial governments in order to maintain this
position of privilege, relations with the state began to domesticate
rather than empower. Lay rulers exercised newfound control over the
institution, replacing traditional school structure with appointed heads
of colleges and even establishing their own universities (Verger, 1972),
such that by the fifteenth century, the university was thoroughly
defined by local territorial politics (Kaminsky, 1972). University
domestication reached its zenith in the Early Modern period, as a result
of both ecclesiastical reform and state centralization. Although
intimately tied to the state, universities were still church
institutions, and, therefore, equally impacted by Protestantism.
Reforms, initiated by both Protestant critics and the church itself,
reduced clerical duties to almost exclusively preaching, investing
university masters with the responsibility to disseminate a civic and
moral code, and divesting them of the authority to elucidate divine
knowledge (Hill, 1972). At the same time, the political upheaval of the
religious wars catalyzed a process of centralization, allowing state
infrastructure to more closely manage the social and religious life of
their population. Indeed, following the Reformation, states throughout
Europe adopted, or invented, national churches, exercising unprecedented
control over clergy and, by extension, university masters. Thus, by the
16th and 17th centuries, the university had effectively been remade as
an instrument of the state, adopting a vehemently conservative
intellectual and social platform. Universities were expected to endorse
and legitimize the policies of their sponsoring state (Kaminsky, 1972),
and the study of new knowledges was suppressed to such an extent that
contemporary scholars considered them backward in most mathematics and
sciences2 (Hill, 1972). Understandably, enrollment waned and few
students stayed long enough to obtain higher degrees as the institution
undermined its own reputation as a place of learning. And yet, it was in
this period of stagnation that Europe experienced another major
epistemic disruption. Colonial expansion of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries returned knowledges of indigenous peoples and lands which
contradicted, surpassed or were otherwise illegible within Medieval
understandings. The novelty and controversy of these knowledges made
them extremely valuable commodities, trafficked in the "first truly
global commercial enterprise: trading the Other" (Smith, 2012, p. 93).
But, whereas the knowledge looted by Crusaders had revitalized European
thought and prompted the scholastic tradition, the prevailing
antiintellectualism of the universities prohibited engagement with
colonial knowledges. Driven from the university by its conservatism,
laymen instead assumed the responsibility for intellectual development,
organizing themselves into scientific communities, or societies, where
they could collaborate free from university oversight (Smith, 2012).
Engrossed in a growing body of heretical knowledge, and guided by
nascent principles of rationalism, positivism, skepticism, and
objectivity, these independent men of wealth began the radical
reformulation of European thought that culminated in modern philosophy.
In the process, scientific societies also refined and standardized
research methodologies and categorized knowledge into the system of
disciplines which constitute modern scientific practice (Simpson, 2014).
Mirroring the university's own rise to prominence, scientific societies
gained legitimacy for their endeavors through state relations. Having
assumed the work of knowledge production, territorial governments began
to rely upon these secular organizations, especially in implementing
colonial agendas, with society members receiving teaching positions at
colonial universities as well as funding for knowledge extraction and
experimentation on colonized lands 2 At Oxford and Cambridge, algebra
was seen as a "superstitious" discipline, and geometry a "black art"
(Hill, 1972, p. 107). Mayorga et al. -- Burn It Down: The
Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 92 and peoples
(Smith, 2012). This legitimation of the scientific society established
secular intellectualism and its modern philosophy as the dominant
epistemic authority in the West. The secularization of the state in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries then freed the way for its
acquisition of the university, reinvigorating the moribund institution
and realigning its structure in accordance with modern scientific
principles, ideologies, and methods. Throughout this history, and in
every stage of its maturation, the university has been inextricably tied
to state imperialism. Its authority has depended entirely upon state
legitimacy; its intellectual practice evolved through the extraction and
commodification of non-Western knowledges; its structure and methods
fashioned to facilitate state agendas, such that all levels of the
institution, including its disciplines, methodologies, administration,
and funding conform to the imperial project (Atalay, 2006; Smith, 2012;
Simpson, 2014). But[, we are primarily concerned with that recent
institutionalization of modern philosophy---analyzed in the following
pages---because its adoption transfigured the essential function of the
university into a colonization of knowledge]{.underline}. The Epistemic
Violence of the University Birthed through and for the colonial state,
modern philosophy does not coincidentally bear colonialist ideology,
although we would not attempt a full accounting of that here. Rather,
because knowledge production and regulation are the defining functions
of the university, [we analyze the epistemology of modern
philosophy]{.underline}. In doing so, we find that modern epistemology
not only justifies and authorizes colonial violence, but, in itself,
demands epistemic violence. Operating upon these principles, the
essential function of the modern university has become a colonization of
knowledge: **[knowledge is processed to conform to colonial ideology and
agendas, and, in turn, disseminated in order to assimilate the
populace.]{.underline}** [To conceal the inherent violence of that
mission today, the university employs a strategic negligence that
reaffirms its own indispensability.]{.underline} Two epistemological
assumptions narrate modern philosophy: (1) there are certain aspects of
reality which are ubiquitously and invariably true, (2) observation and
logical reasoning are the only means of accessing that absolute truth.
From these two basic assumptions however, issue a number of derivative
beliefs linking knowledge production to power. The first of these
corollaries is the privileging of objectivity, assessing knowledge
against the perceived contamination of subjective experience, by which
**[modern scholars limit the scope of legitimate knowledges to those
consistent with their own principles and tradition. In so doing,
[Western thinkers]{.mark} not only [affirm the superiority of their
knowledge]{.mark} systems [but]{.mark} [also]{.mark} [claim for
themselves the exclusive authority to define knowledge]{.mark} (Smith,
2012).]{.underline}** Moreover, the assumption that absolute truth is
ascertainable practically and ethically implies a responsibility to do
so, creating an obligation for humanity to thoroughly investigate their
reality. Given the exclusive authority of modern Western scholars to
lead that investigation, instrumental reasoning insinuates, and hubris
abets, that all reality need come under Western dominion. On the one
hand, [[this epistemology leaves no room for enchantment, sacrificing
the private and sacred for the pursuit of knowledge3]{.mark} (Grande,
2015). On the other hand, it justifies imperialist ideation and, in
fact, makes scientific investigation dependent upon the subjugation of
non-Western peoples and lands.]{.underline} In order to understand
reality, modern philosophy thus 3 For a recent example, see the conflict
over the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea (Overbye, 2016). Mayorga et
al. -- Burn It Down: The Incommensurability of the University and
Decolonization 93 engenders material and symbolic violences against
reality. But, more immediately[, modern scientific investigation and
knowledge production, in themselves, constitute epistemic violence.
Modern philosophy is confronted by the same conflict as is any
intellectual paradigm: incorporating and rectifying new knowledges with
the old]{.underline}. In its pursuit of absolute truth, however,
**[modern philosophy cannot engage in dialogic relations, but is
confined to the dialectic, and, operating upon the presumed objective
superiority of its own knowledge traditions, must contort new knowledge
so that it takes on a form comprehensible within its own ideological
framework]{.underline}**. [That framework, of course, extends far beyond
modern philosophy itself, to a larger knowledge system metaphorically
described as the Western cultural archive]{.underline} (Smith, 2012):
[cosmologies, ontologies, ethical systems, histories, symbols and their
associations, which predate Christian civilization]{.underline}
(Deloria, 2003), [and from which the Western sociological imagination
derives]{.underline}. [In the wake of global colonization, this archive
has also been overwhelmingly saturated by the imagery and ideology of
colonial cultures]{.underline} (Nandy, 1983), [including what Grande
(2015) names the "deep structures of the colonialist
consciousness]{.underline}" (p. 99): [the conflation of progress with
change, the separateness of faith and reason, the impersonal nature of
reality, individualism, and anthropocentrism]{.underline}. Knowledge
that has been extracted by the university must be sieved through this
heterogeneous composition before it becomes legitimate within the modern
paradigm. Of course, [the only knowledge able to emerge from this
processing is that which upholds the values, doctrines, and political
necessities of the West]{.underline} (Smith, 2012). In particular, that
which defines the violence of colonization as natural and/or necessary,
and affirms the colonial state as the only entity able to exercise
legitimate forms of violence (Rifkin, 2009). **[By mutilating and
eradicating contradictory knowledges in this manner, the essential
functions of the university, extracting, processing, producing, and
regulating knowledge, become an epistemic colonization, enriching,
evolving, and safeguarding the settler state.]{.underline}** As with any
colonialism however, those knowledge functions also entail a
civilizational mission (Nandy, 1983), exporting assimilatory knowledge
products in order to reproduce the colonialist consciousness.
Assimilation was the explicit mission of colonial universities, Indian
agents, and church missionaries (Grande, 2015), but, because the
university is integrated within the state, its knowledges are also
implicitly reified throughout state infrastructure. For example, such
[knowledge enters public education alongside official instructional
content as a hidden curriculum (Anyon, 1980), latent norms, values, and
beliefs which socialize students into colonialist worldviews and ways of
knowing (Grande, 2015). This circulation and naturalization of
assimilatory knowledges works to both colonize the mind of the
indigenous (Fanon, 2005) and decivilize that of the colonizer (Césaire,
1955), inhibiting decolonial action and enabling further material,
symbolic, and epistemic violences]{.underline}. While in earlier periods
the university openly embraced this colonialist purpose, democratic
social movements and anticolonial struggle of the twentieth century made
doing so antithetical to its self-professed role of social institution.
And yet, since the university first allied itself with the state, it has
suppressed the social, in order to protect the state and thereby itself.
The key, in this context, to concealing university violence while still
maintaining a facade of social consciousness, is institutional
negligence (Moten & Harney, 2004). All three authors, throughout their
time in higher education, have witnessed and experienced this negligence
firsthand. We have seen a university negligently undertake public
discussion of genocide, while intentionally and explicitly defining
their topic so as to exclude settler colonial Mayorga et al. -- Burn It
Down: The Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 94
violence. Negligently, a university has excused its failure to recruit
and support indigenous students, as well as its responsibility to
disrupt and remunerate colonial oppression, claiming that they won't
admit students who are incapable of thriving at the school. Negligently,
following a Title IX investigation for the mishandling of sexual assault
cases, a university centralized student services and activities, but
remains reticent to punish rapists. Negligently, a university publicizes
its benevolent charity and community-building projects in the Third
World, while withholding the profits of that billion-dollar industry
from the underdeveloped, Black community down the road. The epistemic
manifestation of negligence is an immobilizing skepticism within the
university: scholars - and administrators - must always be uncertain of
their own claims (Moten & Harney, 2004). To be perpetually skeptical
allows one to investigate all of reality, even one's own coloniality,
while discouraging the impetuous impulse to make conclusions and act
upon them, sustaining a cycle of uninterrupted knowledge production and
delaying decolonization indefinitely. Negligently, the university does
not dismiss its coloniality, but closes off our vision of possibility to
include nothing except itself. In summation, [colonialism is not
vestigial or superficial to the university; the university's essential
functions, producing and regulating knowledge, embody a colonization of
knowledge, complete with its own civilizational mission. Nor does this
framing of knowledge and knowing, the subjugation of knowledge to the
capacities of coloniality, take place in ivory-tower
isolation]{.underline}. The epistemic violence of the university mission
exists in order to sustain and validate the colonial state, to make it
inviolable in the minds of all, performing the intellectual labor behind
indigenous elimination. Incommensurable Agendas **[We are led to believe
that the university could be decolonized.]{.underline}** In these
appeals, the university is imagined as a force for the decolonial
project, even becoming its primary vehicle. But the goals of the two are
fundamentally incompatible, making it impossible to incorporate one into
the other. **[[Decolonization dislocates the colonial, divests its power
from indigenous life]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The university on the other
hand, birthed by colonialism, is an essential agent of extant colonial
violence, both materially, in extracting, accumulating, and withholding
resources from marginalized communities, and epistemically, in
monopolizing legitimate knowledges. It is dedicated to global
colonization, to salvaging and defining settler futurity, through the
construction of knowledge itself**[. [Indigenous self-determination is
not a possibility in either its political project or its conception of
reality]{.mark}. [To decolonize]{.mark} [the university]{.mark}
[would]{.mark}, therefore, [contradict its ideological purpose and
impede its essential practice]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, we know that
these decolonial appeals are hollow. Our own experiences and studies, as
well as the histories and struggles of our communities, make it clear
that the university could never be an agent of decolonization as long as
this essential colonialist purpose remains intact. In fact, survivance
will always be inhibited as long as an institution like the university
has the authority to control and define our existence. As such**[,
[indigenous futurity depends upon eliminating]{.mark} these [colonial
agendas, so that we might imagine ways to look, live, and strive beyond
them]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And yet, it is both fashionable and tactful
within these institutions to adopt the language of decolonization (Tuck
& Yang, 2012). Just as multiculturalism and other agendas have been
coopted by the university, these are specious attempts to salvage the
settler project through Mayorga et al. -- Burn It Down: The
Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 95
reconciliation (Coulthard, 2014); including and thereby enclosing the
colonized as subjects of the settler state (Grande, 2015). Whatever
eloquence shrouds these policies however, it cannot hide the brazen
negligence which allows one to speak of inclusivity, within an
institution sustained by exclusion and exploitation; to offer global
citizenship as consolation for the forcible domestication of indigenous
sovereignty (Simpson, 2014); to grant mobility to the private
individual, while criminalizing the communities one dislocates; and to
boast of diversity within a project of cultural, political, and
ideological homogenization. The University Cannot be Salvaged Because
the university is a fundamentally colonial institution, decolonization
would require more than these self-serving half measures and instead,
transforming its essential nature. As with all institutions, such
transformation targets the university's material dependency upon
colonial exploitation, as well as its integration within and service to
the settler state. For the university in particular however, we must
attend to the colonialist ideology animating its knowledge functions.
But without this, what remains of the university? Its research methods
and methodologies, as well as knowledge packaging, sale, and
institutionalization would have to be redirected from their current
exploitative and repressive formulas (Smith, 2012; Simpson, 2014).
Moreover, if we divest the university of its assumed authority over
knowledge, what purpose does it serve? And upon whose authority does it
act? In short, decolonization requires the university to become a
totally new entity, vested with a new mission, organization, practices,
and responsibilities. However, we realize that such comprehensive reform
is not practically viable. The university is skilled in inhibiting
structural reform. It does so not by simply dismissing or ignoring
criticism, but by becoming 'vigilant in its negligence' (Moten & Harney,
2004, p. 106), incorporating critique nominally and adopting the
appearance of sympathy, thereby circumventing a decolonial
confrontation. In its vigilance, [the university performs what Tuck and
Yang (2012) term settler moves to innocence (p. 9), stratagems which, in
the pretense of critical self-reflection, divert decolonial
transformation into salvaging settler futurity and
conscience]{.underline}. Swarthmore, for example, regularly employs
\"collections,\" convening the campus body, especially in response to an
incident, inviting all attendees to speak. These gatherings demonstrate
to a larger audience that the school is sensitive to campus concerns,
that they are willing to give students and community members the space
to express themselves, but without creating any responsibility to act
upon those sentiments. In fact, the equal privilege afforded to all
speakers, regardless of relations of power and personal benefit, makes
the supposedly democratic space of the collection a venue for university
representatives to discredit student and faculty concerns. Even when a
school does sincerely critique its own coloniality, this "dialogue" is
still undertaken for the purposes of absolvement and self-preservation
rather than the restoration of indigenous sovereignty (Byrd, 2011). And
as this nominal call for reform has become professional academic
practice, the university reaffirms the necessity of its own existence
through those who would question it (Moten & Harney, 2004). Thus the
critical academic is made complicit in the institution's negligence,
locked into the university's attempts to become amenable to those it
oppresses. To be critical of the university traps one within settler
futurity. And so, we, from our different positions, reject the desire
for inclusion, for a more critically engaged university. **[[Rather than
confront an institution that will not, indeed cannot,
recognize]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mayorga et al. -- Burn It Down: The
Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 96
[**[indigenous sovereignty, we seek self-recognition and indigenous
modes of life independent of this settler apparatus]{.underline}**
(]{.mark}Coulthard, 2014). We acknowledge that the only possible
relationship to the university is a criminal one (Moten & Harney, 2004),
that those of us who survive the institution have a responsibility to
betray it and appropriate its resources for our peoples (Fanon, 2005).
Although the university cannot be salvaged---given how thoroughly it is
defined by coloniality---it has engorged itself on the material and
intellectual resources of indigenous peoples around the world, and these
resources are worthy of preservation. Those of us with all the benefits
and privileges of a college degree, best able to access those resources,
are responsible for moving them back into the communities they came
from, in an enriching and sustaining manner. This repatriation is not a
"sharing" of university resources, which would engender relationships of
dependency. Rather, it is theft, using the university's own property to
enable communities to thrive independent of the institution. [While each
of us possesses unique skills and capacities, if you are not leveraging
your position in some manner to contribute to this theft, you are
helping to maintain the settler colonial university. That is why we say
loot the bookshelves and burn the school down.]{.underline} A Decolonial
Alternative to the University If we cannot (and will not) salvage the
university, what will we do instead? Right now, we are focused on
articulating a vision of education in a decolonial future, creating
spaces for survival, story sharing, and resource conversion. This
section outlines and deepens that vision. [The current, neoliberal model
of education is a system of dislocation: seeking a formal education is a
trajectory that requires leaving your home and community, your lands, to
exist (continually marginalized) in colonial seats of power, seldom able
to return home.]{.underline} [There is, however, nothing inherently
colonial about people organizing themselves in search of knowledge/ways
of knowing, and we agree that education is crucial to thriving
individuals and communities.]{.underline} In fact, we know that
collectivity transgresses and challenges colonial individualism. So,
what does it look like, this alternative we are calling for? We find it
difficult to argue against the notions of choice and freedom narrating
education under neoliberalism. Yet, we also recognize their function in
expanding the colonial project. We acknowledge radical/leftist
pedagogies which have arisen to combat these neoliberal logics, but they
themselves are only conditionally suited to a decolonial education,
limited by their foundation in Western ideology4 (Grande, 2015). We must
instead base our aspirations in a new (or perhaps, older) language for
notions like freedom, knowledge, sovereignty, and self-determination
(Alfred, 2006). **[The priorities of indigenous
self-determination---[land and community]{.mark}---[must]{.mark} then,
also [serve as the foundation of a decolonial
education]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[As opposed to the self-serving,
violent individualism of liberal ideology, self-determination is a
collective faculty that may only be exercised through the relations
which constitute the collective.]{.underline}**]{.mark} We therefore,
call for an education that does not produce solitary individuals within
transnational society, but members of interdependent communities,
conscious of their relations and capable of fulfilling the
responsibilities within 4 e.g. Radical Marxism offers a number of
prophetic educational models challenging the social stratification and
individualization encultured in contemporary schooling. Marxist
theories, however, often consider colonialism a necessary stage in
progressing from capitalist to socialist states (Coulthard, 2014); even
Paulo Freire reproduces anthropocentric and paternalistic ideologies in
his Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1970; 2000). Mayorga et al. -- Burn It
Down: The Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 97
those relationships. Such an education fosters intentional communities
of learning (Delpit, 2012, p. 42), where students are socialized into
relationships between individuals, families, peoples, and with their
lands, with a critical understanding of the colonial histories intruding
upon those relations. Understood not as a tool of personal social
mobility but as a pillar that articulates and sustains publics,
**[[education cannot remain a "neutral" resource; it must actively
maintain the vitality of the community.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Therefore, education cannot be available only to those with financial
and social capital, but rather, accessible to all, regardless of age,
ability, or other limiting factors, for all individuals are deserving
of, and indeed, must be prepared to fulfill their roles within the
community. We find inspiration for these endeavors in the alternative
educational systems already devised by indigenous peoples: The Rough
Rock Demonstration School on the Navajo Reservation (McCarty, 2002);
Tribal Colleges around the U.S (Tierney, 1992); The Kula Kaiapuni
schools of Hawai'i (Office of Hawaiian Education, 2015); Te Kōhanga Reo
in New Zealand (May, 2004); El Sistema Autónomo de Educación Zapatista
(Plataforma, 2013); Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižiŋ Owáyawa at Standing Rock
(Waterdefenders, 2016). We also acknowledge Sandy Grande (2015) in
outlining a pedagogical theory compatible with the indigenous project of
sovereignty, as well as the work of Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2012) and Audra
Simpson (2014) in preparing decolonial modes of research. Criminal
Practice in the University Building educational systems that can resist
and supplant the university requires pedagogy which can "disrupt the
structures of inequality" (Grande, 2015, p. 6). It at the same time
requires navigating the existing institution, its relationship to
various forms of power, and stewarding its demise. For that purpose we
identify three interconnected stances---related attitudes, strategies,
and frameworks---which we have observed and which may be used in a
decolonial approach to the university. We name these stances survival,
empowerment, and (theft by) conversion. We see them as what Melamed
(2016) describes as "forms of practice, accountability, and collectivity
within the university, behind its back, and beyond its reckoning" (p.
982). We begin each of the following subsections with a testimonio
(Acevedo, 2001; PourKhorshid, 2016) from one of our authors, in order to
elaborate and contextualize these stances within the felt theories that
manifest them. Taken together, they represent our conviction that we can
not only survive the university, but that we can (and should) be in the
process of stealing from and burning it down, and teach about its
violence, while building spaces that serve and are governed by
indigenous communities. They are how we create decolonial moments within
an institution that is intent on maintaining its colonial dominance over
peoples, lands, and knowledges. Survival Daniel: School had never been a
place of joy, or learning. So, I did not expect much from Swarthmore.
And yet, because the college offered me so many opportunities as well as
a supposedly generous amount of financial aid, it was beyond criticism.
The isolation I felt, the meaninglessness of our studies, I attributed
to my own failures and flaws. How ungrateful it Mayorga et al. -- Burn
It Down: The Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 98
would have been to blame the college, when my whole family had worked to
get me there. In fact, I had never done anything to deserve this
"once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity. They deserved it, not me. But they
never got the chance, and when I did, I didn't even appreciate it. I
wandered around that campus for four years, feeling completely foreign,
finding over and over again that the people and place I had come from
did not belong there. At the same time, the longer I stayed, the less I
belonged to my own home. What would I return to after graduating, and
who would I be by then? Would my family even recognize me, having
abandoned them for so long? I had come for a diploma; too late did I
realize that its price was everything I had before. It was only after
witnessing the stories of others, first in the student protests of the
spring of 2013, and later as an archivist for the Intercultural Center,
that I came to understand the role of the institution in my experience,
and to name that experience as one of violence. And it is only now,
looking back at that time through this study, that I find catharsis.
Although Swarthmore enacted upon us physical, personal, and epistemic
violences, none of them originate with this school. They arise
inescapably from Swarthmore's institutional nature, as a college, as a
"nonprofit," as a putative place of learning intermingling the knowledge
industry with the settler state. The civilizing mission of the
university is concentrated in the personal experience of faculty, staff,
and students, undermining physical, psychic, emotional, and spiritual
health; in order to build a future outside of this reality, we must
first survive it. In this regard, we would say that surviving means
maintaining a holistic wellbeing, emerging from the institution with an
intact sense of self in relation to place and people. Therefore,
graduation and tenure are not an indication of having survived. In fact,
some of us may need to drop out in order to survive. Enacted under the
duress of colonial violence, survival denotes a critical relationship to
the university, and resulting strategies, which preserve one's self,
attempting to protect the nonWestern ways of knowing and being targeted
for elimination. Recognizing the university as both insidious and
negligent, survival grows within the subject as a constant vigilance;
skepticism and distrust distance one from the institution. The turning
away of one's sympathies and hopes becomes an unwillingness to rely upon
the university, an unwillingness to be surprised by its failures, an
expectation of incompetence, delinquency, and maliciousness. Survival,
therefore, manifests in tenuous and flexible dealings with the
university, designed to exploit the institution for all its resources,
while attempting to limit the pressure that institution exerts on the
subject. As an active practice, survival draws upon the full range of
one's resistant capital, those oppositional knowledges, behaviors, and
skills that challenge structural inequality (Yosso, 2005, p. 80). Of
these, escape is a primary survival strategy, breaking free from
unwelcoming and damaging spaces and retreating to an indigenous one:
ditching class, secluding yourself in a private study room, taking a
leave of absence, speaking your language, moving off-campus, etc. In
addition, when confronted by assimilatory knowledges in the classroom,
some survive by notlearning (Kohl, 1993), while others in the same
situation may look for ways to take control of their education and teach
themselves. Knowing the discrimination one will face, some intentionally
build relationships around campus, creating allies for when the balloon
goes up. Others choose their relationships cautiously, dedicating
themselves only to those individuals who will help them to grow.
Critical of the university, some take on the role of a double agent,
mastering the norms and language of the institution to pass through
undetected, while others engage in creative maladjustment, refusing to
make moral or personal compromises, confronting the university in
accordance with their own sense of integrity (Kohl, 1993). We base this
description and these examples in the accounts of Native students at
Swarthmore who Mayorga et al. -- Burn It Down: The Incommensurability of
the University and Decolonization 99 contextualize their own experiences
in terms of survival, but by whatever means, we need you to survive.
Empowerment Lekey: Fulfilling the end goal of the path on which I found
myself, however unwillingly, through entering Swarthmore cost me dearly.
By our own definition, I have not survived. During and after my time at
Swarthmore, my mental health suffered and I experienced a profound sense
of alienation. After leaving Swarthmore, I often found myself paralyzed
with anxiety and disconnected from others, unable to articulate what I
was feeling, or why. I grappled with guilt from having accrued the
social (and financial) capital that Swarthmore imparts, intended to
differentiate and separate me from the communities I am part of. I
struggled along the path of "mobility" out of obligation to my community
and family members who had not received the same opportunities afforded
to me. Nowhere in Swarthmore's pedagogy was there room for students to
become anything other than agents of the university, who, upon exiting,
would perpetuate its colonial practices and knowledges. During my time
at Swarthmore, I gradually understood that the institution's disregard
for the mental and spiritual well-being of students (and others) is not
a coincidence, but a fundamental feature that exemplifies its
coloniality. My conviction grew: The colonial structure must go. I
reject the concept of my "inclusion" in the university and understand
the rhetoric of "inclusion" as assimilatory, as antithetical to
decolonization. For us who seek knowledge based in our experiences and
our communities, we become inherently "criminal" in our relationship to
the university. We have no choice but to steal. If Swarthmore did
educate us, then it did so at the price of who we once were. Upon
graduating, many of my friends and I felt torn from our communities and
faced the task of learning how to return. In being shaped into
\"individuals,\" we lost the original markers of who we are: beings in
community. What did help me get through the alienating and violent
experience of the university were the pockets of space---physical,
discursive, and otherwise---in which I felt safe, in which not only my
ideas, but my feelings and dreams would be honored. I and the other
authors fought for this space, in which we could, in community, work
towards something that affirmed, nurtured, and liberated all of us. If
we understand survival to be characterized by fugitivity and
self-preservation, then empowerment is characterized by personal and
collective enrichment, cultivation in opposition to and defiance of
settler colonial violence. Recognizing that the university cannot
provide a decolonial education, empowerment fills its place; one gathers
knowledge, skills, resources, and relationships, and re-appropriates
them in order to carry out decolonial acts and to prepare for an
independent future. Empowerment uses strategies and/or tools for
individuals to maintain or deepen their connections to their
communities. For example, Lekey and Daniel operated out of this stance
by taking control of their education at Swarthmore, redirecting it for
their own purposes. Lekey maneuvered university resources to continue
learning Tibetan, where she was able to practice spoken and written
Tibetan and develop sustaining relationships with her teacher,
classmates, and other members of the Tibetan community. Daniel created a
special-major in Native Education, allowing him to study indigenous and
decolonial scholarship despite their absence at the College. Both
examples did fulfill a university requirement imposed upon students,
allowing Mayorga et al. -- Burn It Down: The Incommensurability of the
University and Decolonization 100 them to deflect attention or
consequences, but the true purpose of these efforts surpassed and could
never be recognized as valuable in this settler colonial context. Beyond
personal benefit however, empowerment is primarily directed toward the
development of communities. Daniel attempted to co-opt his senior thesis
project and use its resources to document the survival stories of Native
students of the college. It became an opportunity to pass on the
collective knowledge Natives had gained in resisting the institution, a
resource for future students and their families. Likewise, Lekey
participated in Serenity Soular, an environmental justice partnership
with a neighborhood in nearby Philadelphia. Lekey learned and practiced
collective accountability and concrete organizing skills while also
appropriating institutional resources (grants, donations, etc.) for the
collective's work in Philly. Acts of empowerment may or may not be
legible to the university, or perhaps only partially, as something to
co-opt. They will, however, always have a purpose which extends beyond
the confines of the university's settler colonial mission. In the case
of Daniel, his personal studies became the basis of his senior thesis.
Daniel strategically chose this pathway to ensure that he would be
permitted the academic freedom and resources to fulfill this graduation
requirement while working towards a project he had deemed necessary for
the wellbeing of future Native students at Swarthmore. The above
strategic approaches and actions activate a person or community's
position within the university to enable the building of spaces,
relationships, practices, and more that will undermine, outlast, or
supplant the university. Empowerment moves the actor within the
university from the critical to the criminal, and requires careful and
ongoing assessment of the colonial machinations of the university. In
the empowerment stance, we can strategically position ourselves to
exploit when necessary and to undermine where possible, all with an eye
toward securing our communities' decolonial future in which the
university, along with all remaining settler colonial structures and
institutions, have been dismantled. (Theft by) Conversion Edwin: As I
began working at the College, I had mixed emotions. "This is my
opportunity," I said to myself, "my opportunity to be an
educator-scholar-activist who could, potentially, have an impact on
something, on someone." I was excited, I was grateful. Still, having
navigated U.S. education as an arrivant of Color for over three decades,
I had grown increasingly wary of the purposes of higher education. When
I began to work with Lekey and Daniel, their experiences echoed this
concern. From our positions as students, educators, and survivors, we
were asking ourselves how the university functioned as settler
colonialism, and what were the effects of being caught up in this
project for us and our loved ones? Through this process of more deeply
understanding the settler coloniality of the university I have witnessed
the manifestations of imperial violence in the lives of students, my
colleagues, and myself. We are taught to desire financial/occupational
security and shareholdership in the educational enterprise, and to
believe that productivity and civility (not of our own design) are the
means to attain those desires. What goes unaddressed is that those
desires are a fiction that are only necessary to the sustainability of
settler coloniality. In attempting to fulfill these fictitious desires,
we have had to endure physical, mental, spiritual and economic
challenges that have made our lives ever more precarious---increasing
our vulnerability to premature death. Survive? Some of us have.
Empowered? Some of us have made ourselves. But this must end. Mayorga et
al. -- Burn It Down: The Incommensurability of the University and
Decolonization 101 While survival and empowerment, in their many forms,
are essential, the complexities of existing as an arrivant of Color
employed by the settler university requires me to also think about what
it means to stay in this place. We can walk out on the system
(Andreotti, Stein, Ahenakew, & Hunt, 2015) by graduating or leaving the
university (being pushed out/quitting/withdrawing), and developing
alternatives separate from the system. What I am beginning to realize
though, is that while decolonization is global, its particularities and
enactments are local and intimate. Decolonization requires us to attend
to both the systemic and the intimate, and walking out is but one
approach. I think some must walk out, while others must stay in the
intimacies of coloniality to keep the embers burning. My commitment to
being an accomplice to decolonization, my desire to teach about imperial
violence and practices of survivance, and most importantly the
nourishment I feel being in solidarity with students and colleagues,
compels me to want to stay. Being moved to stay, I ask myself, what does
it mean for me to stay? What are the goals of staying? What are its
practices? The practice of staying is not a process of salvaging the
university, but rather a process of facilitating the slow burning of a
violent, unsustainable system. One of the practices we can, and have
been engaging in, is conversion, or (theft by) conversion. (Theft by)
conversion is a legal term that describes when a person lawfully obtains
possession of another person's property, but then converts that property
into funds for their own use, interfering with the rights of the owner
(Davis, 2016). If someone, for example, loses their wallet, and you find
it and decide to keep it instead of returning it to its rightful owner,
you are converting that wallet to your use (Davis, 2016). In the context
of the university, whose underlying premise is ownership of knowledge
and monetized resources, those of us who stay can 'lawfully' access the
exclusive privileges of academia but then convert it into resources for
use of the public/our communities, against the wishes, and independent,
of the university. Increasingly, universities have articulated a renewed
interest in the notion of public or engaged scholarship, an approach
that often employs practices similar to what we are calling conversion.
Barker (2004), argues that engaged scholarship is a response to the
increased specialization of knowledge, the dominance of positivist
epistemology, and the corporatization of the university. A common thread
is the linking of the university and its resources to external
communities in order to focus action to benefit the public (Barker,
2004). While seemingly well intentioned, the history of objectification
and exploitation that indigenous, Black, and other communities of Color
experience when interfacing with the university (Smith, 2012), signals
that ultimately engaged scholarship is an attempt to salvage the
university and settler futurity. Acts of (theft by) conversion however,
are distinguished by their criminal intent; they are undertaken in order
to engage the public in the university's knowledge functions, to teach
about its violent ways, to divest the university of exclusive ownership
of knowledge (property), and repatriate material resources to
dispossessed communities, contributing to the slow and steady
obsolescence of the university. Moreover, these collective acts of
conversion create potential spaces, or collectives of sovereignty, which
aim to "not only refuse forms of knowledge and knowledge-making
contingent upon settler imperatives but also to conscientiously enact
others founded in Indigenous specificity and wellbeing" (Grande, 2015,
p. 12). (Theft by) conversion is thus not only about the redirection of
materials but also about "constructing the conditions for a different
kind of encounter," one "that both opposes ongoing colonization and that
seeks to heal the social, cultural, and spiritual ravages of colonial
history" (Gaztambide-Fernández 2012, p. 42). Mayorga et al. -- Burn It
Down: The Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 102
Two of Edwin's emerging conversion projects, BarrioEdProject and his
Critical Racial/ Ethnic Studies course, exemplify these practices. The
Education in our Barrios, or BarrioEdProject, is a youth participatory
action research collaborative with Swarthmore students and Philadelphia
high school students that focuses on healing, youth leadership
development, critical racial/ethnic studies, and co-designing and
conducting a research project to address the living conditions of their
communities. Rather than the academic, colonial imperative of making
minoritized youth and communities objects of study, we use our
curriculum of conocimiento \[knowing ourselves, knowing our
communities\] (Mayorga & Rosales, in press) to look upon ourselves, our
communities and our histories as the basis of how to be in, and
transform, the world. The resources of the university are converted to
facilitate work that ultimately decenters and turns away from the
university, in order to broaden participants' capacities to enact
knowledge-making for resistance and wellbeing (Mayorga & Rosales, in
press). Where BarrioEdProject works primarily outside the university,
Edwin's course, The Undercommons: Critical Racial/Ethnic Studies and
Education, is a primary tool for igniting collectives of sovereignty
within and across institutions. Starting with Grande's (2015) Red
Pedagogy and Harney and Moten's (2013) The Undercommons, students trace
the history, and teaching, of Racial/Ethnic Studies as a means to
decenter coloniality and better understand abolition, while also
studying critical pedagogies to imagine alternative relationships
between knowledge, history, people, and the land. Indeed, a key aspect
of our shared inquiry is an analysis of the coloniality of K-16
education itself. Upon this theoretical basis, students in the course
collaborate with local K-12 community educators in working on
racial/ethnic studiesfocused curricula that will become part of a
curricular database, #EthnicStudiesPHL. More recently, Edwin is in the
planning stages of reworking this course so that it compliments the
emergence of the CREATE coalition. Critical Racial/Ethnic Studies
Action, Transformation & Education (CREATE) (2019), "is a group of
Swarthmore students and faculty committed to raising visibility of
oppressed voices, perspectives, and histories in our curriculum through
Critical Racial and Ethnic Studies" (Who We Are section, para. 6). The
goal of CREATE is continually evolving, but the efforts are not to
institutionalize critical racial/ethnic studies at the campus, but to
create a robust space for collectives of sovereignty. The Undercommons
course, it is hoped, will signal to students and faculty a location
where this transformative work can be taught, examined and taken in
scholarly and political directions. As such, Edwin's intention across
these conversion projects is to expand our collective capacity to
interrogate colonial education and to begin working toward the
deflagration of these institutions as they exist today. These stances as
we have defined them are not discrete or linear, progressing from one to
the next; rather, they overlap and are often enacted simultaneously in
ongoing resistance. For instance, creating conversion spaces will most
likely take on the work of empowering its participants, being in itself
both a decolonial act and one which prepares for collective action. And
yet, these spaces may also serve as a refuge from otherwise hostile
environments, and thereby be an important component of one's survival
and our shared capacity to heal. Thus it is that we see the
decolonization of education naturally invoking all three of these
stances. Conclusion From its inception, the university has been yoked to
imperialism. The extraction and commodification of non-Western
knowledges and goods provided the material conditions for its Mayorga et
al. -- Burn It Down: The Incommensurability of the University and
Decolonization 103 development, while also evolving its intellectual
traditions. It was able to claim an exclusive authority over knowledge
by lending its support to imperial states, which subsequently began to
refine its structure, organization, methods, disciplines, and knowledge
paradigm to facilitate their own agendas. The final adoption of modern
epistemological principles, reflecting this imperial narration,
transformed the university's essential functions - generating and
curating knowledge - into a colonization of knowledge, an epistemic
violence that justifies and perpetuates the colonial state. Coloniality
is not historic or superficial to the university, but a fundamentally
defining feature and motivating force. [The university cannot be a
vehicle for decolonization as long as it is defined by this coloniality,
because the agendas of the two are incommensurable]{.underline}. To
attempt to salvage the university would, therefore, require the
institution to become an entirely new entity, including even its
essential knowledge functions. But, the university conceals its violence
through negligence, and employs settler moves to innocence, diverting
decolonial transformation towards self-preservation and the
reconciliation of the oppressed. Thus, we argue, that [the university
cannot be decolonized. It cannot be salvaged. It must be incinerated. In
place of the university, we offer a decolonial vision of education,
based in the principles of self-determination, as articulated by
indigenous educators around the world.]{.underline} [To reach that
vision, we must both steal from the university while it still stands,
and begin building educational communities that can supplant
it]{.underline}. We identify three stances that can be employed from
within the university for this purpose. Survival is a critical
relationship to the university, drawing upon one's resistant capital, in
order to protect non-Western ways of knowing and being and emerge from
the institution intact. Empowerment strengthens one's connections to
place and people, while cultivating the skills and resources necessary
for decolonial work. Lastly, (theft by) conversion repatriates
university property to the communities it was stolen from and fosters
spaces of sovereignty that will enable us to live independent of the
institution once it is in ashes. Epilogue We have been told the
university is our only option now, and that it is truly a good for all.
But [we are asking for all of us to abandon the university. We see that
as our only option now.]{.underline} [Because as an inherently colonial
institution, it cannot be reformed, and we will not allow ourselves to
be reconciled]{.underline}. It is the exact work of hegemony that
narrows our view to exclude all but the university. But we cannot accept
recognition from the very system that both (a) denies that anything was
ever broken and (b) assumes that we are the broken part; so [we refuse
to ask to be acknowledged, and instead we want to take apart, dismantle,
tear down the structure that, right now, limits our ability to find each
other, to see beyond it, and to access the places that we know lie
outside its walls]{.underline} (Halberstam, 2013, p. 6). **[[We cannot
say what new structures will replace the ones we live with yet, because
once we have torn them down, we will inevitably see more and see
differently and feel a new sense of wanting and being and
becoming]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What we want after "the break" will be
different from what we think we want before the break, and both are
necessarily different from the desire that issues from being in the
break. But it is possible to live otherwise. Yes, we must survive, and
gain power and knowledge and money to make any of our revolutionary
imaginings a reality. But that work will only help to evolve the
colonial state as long as we continue to operate within and rely upon
its institutions. So we ask that everyone become a teacher and a
student; that we move education into our own Mayorga et al. -- Burn It
Down: The Incommensurability of the University and Decolonization 104
hands. **[[Because the state depends upon our labor and loyalty, which
we can dedicate to other endeavors.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Although the United Nations' Working Group on Indigenous Peoples and the
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples have resisted defining
"indigenous peoples" in order to prevent nation-states from policing the
category as a site of exception, Jeff Corntassel (Cherokee) and Taiaiake
Alfred (Kahnawake Mohawk) provide a useful provisional definition in
their essay "Being Indigenous": Indigenousness is an identity
constructed, shaped, and lived in the politicized context of
contemporary colonialism. The communities, clans, nations and tribes we
call Indigenous peoples are just that: Indigenous to the lands they
inhabit, in contrast to and in contention with the colonial societies
and states that have spread out from Europe and other centres of empire.
[It is this oppositional, placebased existence, along with the
consciousness of being in struggle against the dispossessing and
demeaning fact of colonization by foreign peoples, that fundamentally
distinguishes Indigenous peoples from other peoples of the
world]{.underline}.³² [In their definition there emerges a contentious,
oppositional identity and existence to confront imperialism and
colonialism.]{.underline} Indigenousness also hinges, in Alfred and
Corntassel, on certain Manichean allegories of foreign/native and
colonizer/colonized within reclamations of "placebased existence," and
these can, at times, tip into a formulation that does not challenge
neoliberalism as much as it mirrors it. But despite these potential
pitfalls, indigenous critical theory could be said to exist in its best
form when it centers itself within indigenous epistemologies and the
specificities of the communities and cultures from which it emerges and
then looks outward to engage European philosophical, legal, and cultural
traditions in order to build upon all the allied tools available.
[[Steeped in]{.mark} anticolonial [consciousness that]{.mark}
deconstructs and [confronts]{.mark} the [colonial logics]{.mark} of
settler states carved out of and on top of indigenous usual and
accustomed lands, [indigenous critical theory has the potential]{.mark}
in this mode [to offer a **transformative
accountability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [From this vantage, indigenous
critical theory might, [then]{.mark}, [provide a diagnostic way of
reading and interpreting the colonial logics]{.mark} that underpin
cultural, intellectual, and political discourses.]{.underline} But [[it
asks that]{.mark} [settler, native, and arrivant each **acknowledge
their own positions** within empire and then **reconceptualize space**
and history to make visible what imperialism and its resultant settler
colonialisms and diasporas have sought to obscure]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Within the continental United States[, [it means imagining an **entirely
different map** and understanding of territory and space: a map
constituted by over sovereign indigenous nations, with their own borders
and boundaries, that transgress what has been naturalized as contiguous
territory divided into states]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}³³
"[[There is always]{.underline}]{.mark}," Aileen Moreton-Robinson writes
of indigenous peoples' [[**incommensurablity** within the postcolonizing
settler society]{.underline}]{.mark}, "[a subject position that can be
thought of as fixed in its inalienable relation to land]{.underline}.

### Mnemonic Reading 

#### The alternative is a mnemonic reading of the crimes of settler society which denaturalizes the logic of Manifest Destiny.

**Byrd 11**

(Jodi A., Associate Professor of English and American Indian Studies at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, *The Transit of Empire:
Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism*, 2011, p. xii-xiv DH)

[This book]{.underline}, then, is a journey of sorts, its method
mnemonic as it [places]{.underline} seemingly [[disparate
histories]{.mark}, temporalities, [and geographies]{.mark} into
conversation in the hopes that, [through enjambment]{.mark}, it
[might]{.mark} be possible to [perceive how Indianness functions as a
transit within empire]{.mark}. My method]{.underline} here [suggests a
reading praxis]{.underline} inspired by Blackfeet novelist Stephen
Graham Jones\'s Demon Theory, in which he delineates genre as mnemonic
device in order to retell the Medea story through horror narrative.1
[**[The story of the new world is horror, the story of America a
crime]{.mark}**. [To read mnemonically is to connect the
violences]{.mark} and genocides [of colonization to cultural
productions]{.mark} and political movements in order [to disrupt]{.mark}
the elisions of [multicultural]{.mark} liberal [democracy]{.mark} that
seek to rationalize the originary historical traumas that birthed
settler colonialism]{.underline} through inclusion. Such a reading
Indianness becomes a site through which [[U.S. empire]{.mark} orients
and [replicates itself by transforming those to be colonized into
"Indians" through]{.mark} continual [reiterations of pioneer
logics]{.mark}, whether [in the Pacific]{.mark}, the [Caribbean]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} the [Middle East]{.mark}. The familiarity of "Indianness" is
salve for]{.underline} the liberal [multicultural democracy within the
settler societies that serve as empire\'s constituency]{.underline}. In
the wake of this transit, and indeed as its quality as colonialist
practice, one finds discordant and [[competing
representations]{.underline}]{.mark} of diasporic arrivals and native
lived experiences---what I call cacophony throughout this book---that
[[vie for hegemony within the discursive]{.underline}]{.mark}, cultural,
[and political [processes of representation]{.mark}]{.underline} and
identity [[that form the basis for]{.underline}]{.mark} what Wendy Brown
has identified as the states of injury and Foucault and others have
termed [[biopolitics. Bringing indigeneity]{.underline}]{.mark} and
Indians [[front and center]{.mark} to discussions of U.S.
empire]{.underline} as it has traversed across Atlantic and Pacific
worlds [[is a necessary intervention]{.mark} at this historical
moment]{.underline}, precisely [[because it is through]{.mark}
the]{.underline} elisions, [erasures]{.underline}, enjambments, [and
[repetitions of Indianness that one might see the stakes in
decolonial]{.mark}]{.underline}, restorative
[[justice]{.underline}]{.mark} tied to land, life, and grievability. As
Willow Rosenberg in Joss Whedon's television series Buffy the Vampire
Slayer once said, "A vague disclaimer is nobody\'s friend."3 The Transit
of Empire is built upon a number of foundational premises that may or
may not be givens within critical theory but that are rapidly emerging
as foundational to the disciplining of American Indian and indigenous
studies. First, that colonization matters. [For indigenous peoples,
[place]{.mark}]{.underline}, land, sovereignty [[and memory
matter]{.mark}. In a world]{.underline} growing increasingly enamored
with faster, flatter, smooth, [where positionality doesn\'t matter so
much as how it is that we travel there, indigeneity
matters]{.underline}. Second, [[this book temporalizes U.S. empire to
the birth of the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, and [within its assumption of European
colonialist agendas [that sought to appropriate indigenous lands,
knowledges, presences, and identities for its own
use]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, that despite cautions against original
and originary within post- structuralist theory, this book asserts that
[there must be the possibility of [the originary in the new
world]{.mark}, and]{.underline} that [it [is located within the
historical experiences of new world colonizations]{.mark}, genocides,
and violences. [There is a]{.mark} long line of [continuity between the
past and the present that has not been disrupted]{.mark}]{.underline}
despite the fact that the stories we tell may or may not acknowledge
that continuity. And fourth, that [[indigenous peoples must be central
to]{.mark} any [theorizations of]{.mark} the conditions of]{.underline}
postcoloniality, [empire]{.underline}, [and [death-dealing regimes that
arise out of indigenous lands]{.mark}. We are long-memoried peoples, and
we remember what happened the last time the world was
flat]{.underline}.4

#### **Debate is first and foremost a site of subject formation -- thus, we must center the centuries long genocidal structure that forms how we think and exist. The kritik's affective intervention is essential to destabilize the settler psyche that otherwise coheres itself by pushing this violence out of the picture. Anything else is to sustain the ongoing violence of dispossession -- land must come first**

(Phil, 'Imagoed communities: the psychosocial space of settler
colonialism,' Settler Colonial Studies, Special Issue on Globalizing
Unsettlement)/// Kian

Facing assertive indigenous presences within settler colonial spaces,
[[settlers must answer the]{.mark} legitimate [charge that **their daily
life** ]{.mark}**-- in all its banality -- [is predicated
upon]{.mark}**]{.underline} the privileges produced by **[[ongoing
genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The jarring nature of [such charges
offer]{.mark}s [an irreconcilable challenge]{.mark} to
settlers]{.underline} [qua settlers.]{.underline}64 [Should [these
charges]{.mark} become impossible to ignore, they [threaten to
explode]{.mark}]{.underline} the imago of settler colonialism, which had
hitherto operated within [[the settler psyche]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
relatively smooth and benign manner. [This]{.underline} explosion [is
potentiated [by the **revelation of**]{.mark}]{.underline} even a
portion of [**the [violence]{.mark}** that is [required to make settler
life possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. If, for example, settlers are forced
to see 'their' beach as a site of murder and ongoing colonization, it
becomes more difficult to sustain it within the imaginary as a site of
frivolity.65 As Brown writes, in the 'loss of horizons, order, and
identity' [[the subject experiences]{.mark} a sense of [enormous
**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.66 Threatened with this 'loss of
containment\', the settler subject embarks down the road to psychosis.67
Thus, to parlay Brown\'s thesis to the settler colonial context, the
uncontrollable rage that indigenous presences induce within the settler
is not evidence of the strength of settlers, but rather of a subject
lashing out on the brink of its own dissolution. [This
panic]{.underline} -- this rabid and insatiable anger -- [is always
already at the core of the settler]{.underline} as a
[subject]{.underline}. As Lorenzo Veracini observes, the settler
necessarily remains in a disposition of aggression 'even after
indigenous alterities have ceased to be threatening\'.68 [This
disposition results from the **precarity** inherent in the maintenance
of]{.underline} settler colonialism\'s imago, wherein any and all
indigenous presences threaten subjective dissolution of [the settler as
such]{.underline}. Trapped in a Gordian Knot, the very thing that
provides a balm to the settler subject -- further development and
entrenchment of the settler colonial imago -- is also what panics the
subject when it is inevitably contravened.69 We might think of this as a
process of hardening that leaves the imago brittle and more susceptible
to breakage. Their desire to produce a firm imago means that [[settlers
are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[always already]{.mark} in a [psychically
defensive]{.mark} position -- that is, the settler\'s offensive position
on occupied land is sustained through a defensive posture]{.underline}.
For [while settlers desire the total erasure of indigenous populations,
[the]{.mark} attendant [desire to disappear their own identity as
settlers necessitates]{.mark} the **[suppression]{.mark} of both
desires**]{.underline}, [[if the subject\'s reliance on settler]{.mark}
colonial [power]{.mark} structure [is to be **psychically
naturalized**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Settlers' reactions to indigenous
peoples fit, almost universally, with the two ego defense responses that
Sigmund Freud observed. The first of these defenses is to attempt a
complete conversion of the suppressed desire into a new idea. In settler
colonial contexts, [[this requires **averting attention from the
violence of dispossession**]{.mark}; as such, [settlers]{.mark} often
[suggest that they]{.mark} aim to **[create a 'city on the
hill']{.mark}.**]{.underline}70 Freud noted that the conversion defense
mechanism does suppress the anxiety-inducing desire, but it also leads
to 'periodic hysterical outbursts\'. Such is the case when settlers'
utopic visions are forced to confront the reality that the gentile
community they imagine is founded in and perpetuates irredeemable
suffering. A second type of defense is to channel the original desire\'s
energy into an obsession or a phobia. The effects of this defense are
seen in the preoccupation that settler colonialism has with purity of
blood or of community.71 As we have already seen, [[this]{.mark}
obsession at once [solidifies the power of the]{.mark} settler [state,
thereby naturalizing the settler and]{.mark}]{.underline} simultaneously
perpetuating the processes of [[erasing indigenous
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. Psychic defenses are intended to secure
the subject from pain, and whether that pain originates inside or
outside the psyche is inconsequential. [Because of the threat that
indigeneity presents to the phantasmatic wholeness of settler
colonialism, settlers must always remain]{.underline} suspended in a
state of arrested development between these [defensive]{.underline}
positions. Despite any pretensions to the contrary, the settler is
necessarily a parochial subject who continuously coils, reacts,
disavows, and lashes out, when confronted with his dependency on
indigenous peoples and their territory. This psychic precarity exists at
the core of the settler subject because of the unending fear of its own
dissolution, should indigenous sovereignty be recognized.72 Goeman
writes as an explicit challenge to other indigenous peoples, but this
holds true to settler-allies as well, that **[[decolonization must
include an analysis of the]{.mark} dominant 'self-disciplining [colonial
subject]{.mark}']{.underline}**.73 However, as [[this
discussion]{.underline}]{.mark} of subjective precarity demonstrates,
the degree of to which these disciplinary or phenomenological processes
are complete should not be overstated. For settler-allies [[must]{.mark}
also examine and [cultivate the]{.mark} ways in which settler subjects
**fail to be totally disciplined**. Evidence of this **incompletion** is
apparent in the]{.underline} subject\'s arrested state of development.
Discovering the **[[instability at the core of the settler
subject]{.underline}]{.mark}**, indeed of all subjects, is the central
conceit of psychoanalysis. This exception of at least partial failure to
fully subjectivize the settler is also what sets my account apart from
[Rifkin\'s]{.underline}. His [phenomenology falls into the
trap]{.underline} that Jacqueline Rose observes within many sociological
accounts of the subject: that [of assuming a successful internalization
of norms]{.underline}. From [the psychoanalytical
perspective]{.underline}, the 'unconscious constantly [reveals the
"failure"' of internalization.]{.underline}74 As we have seen, within
settler subjects this can be expressed as an irrational anxiety that
expresses itself whenever a settler is confronted with the facts
regarding their colonizing status. Under conditions of total
subjectification, such charges ought to be unintelligible to the
settler. [Thus, [the process of **subject formation is always in
slippage and never totalized**]{.mark}]{.underline} as others might
suggest.75 Because of [[this precarity]{.underline}]{.mark}, the settler
subject is prone to violence and lashing out; but the subject in
slippage also [[provides an avenue by which]{.mark} the process of
[settler colonialism can be **subverted** -- creating cracks in a
phantasmatic wholeness which can be opened wider]{.mark}. Breakages of
this sort offer an opportunity to]{.underline} pursue what Paulette
Regan calls a 'restorying' of settler colonial history and culture, to
[**decenter settler mythologies** built upon and within the
dispossession of indigenous peoples]{.underline}.76 [[The cultivation of
these cracks is a **necessary part of decolonizing work**, as it
continues to **panic and**]{.mark} **thus to [destabilize settler
subjects.]{.mark}** [Resistance to settler colonialism does not occur
only in highly visible moments]{.mark}]{.underline} like the famous
conflict at Kanesatake and Kahnawake,77 [[it also occurs in reiterative
and disruptive practices]{.underline}]{.mark}, presences, [[and **speech
acts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Goeman correctly observes that [[the
'repetitive practices of everyday life']{.mark} are what **[give settler
spaces their meaning]{.mark}**, as they provide a degree of naturalness
to the settler]{.underline} imago and its [psychic
investments]{.underline}.78 As such, [[to **disrupt the ease of these
repetitions** is]{.mark} at once to **striate radically the otherwise
smooth spaces of settler colonialism** and also [to **disrupt the easy
(re)production of the settler subject**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Goeman
calls these subversive acts the 'micro-politics of
resistance\',]{.underline} which historically took the form of 'moving
fences, not cooperating with census enumerators, sometimes disrupting
survey parties' amongst other process.79 These acts [panic]{.underline}
the subject that is disciplined as a product of settler colonial power,
by forcing encounters with the sovereign indigenous peoples that were
imagined to be gone. This [reveals to the settler]{.underline}, if only
fleetingly, [the violence that founds and sustains the settler colonial
relationship. [While such practices may not overthrow the]{.mark}
settler colonial [system, they do **subvert its logics by insistently
drawing attention to the ongoing presence of indigenous
peoples**]{.mark} **who refuse erasure.**]{.underline}

#### The alternative is an act of micro-political resistance which reveals the violence that sustains the settler colonial relationship, disrupting settler spaces and strengthening indigenous subjects spatialities.

[Not only does [the concept of the spatial imago]{.mark} allow us to
interrogate the formation of the settler as a subject, it also [provides
a powerful analytical tool to explain the extreme vitriolic reactions
that indigenous peoples constantly face froxm
settlers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many point to racism as the source of
such reactions, and this is not without cause, as [settlers have long
imbibed a sense of racial and cultural superiority -- particularly
toward indigenous peoples.]{.underline} Despite these prejudices,
[however]{.underline}, Wolfe notes that [the 'primary motive' of settler
colonialism's domination 'is not race' but 'access to
territory'.]{.underline} 63 Thus, [inasmuch as the settler colonial
imago validates access to territory by occluding indigenous sovereignty,
the ongoing presences on and claims to the land by indigenous peoples
trouble the settler imago and induce panic in settler subjects. Facing
assertive indigenous presences within settler colonial spaces, settlers
must answer the legitimate charge that their daily life -- in all its
banality -- is predicated upon the privileges produced by ongoing
genocide. The jarring nature of such charges offers an irreconcilable
challenge to settlers qua settlers]{.underline}.64 [Should these charges

'periodic hysterical outbursts'. Such is the case when settlers' utopic
visions are forced to confront the reality that the gentile community
they imagine is founded in and perpetuates irredeemable suffering. [A
second type]{.underline} of defense [is to channel the original desire's
energy into an obsession or a phobia. The effects of this]{.underline}
defense [are seen in the preoccupation that settler colonialism has with
purity of blood or of community]{.underline}.71 As we have already seen,
[this obsession at once solidifies the power of the settler state,
thereby naturalizing the settler and simultaneously perpetuating the
processes of erasing indigenous peoples. Psychic defenses are intended
to secure the subject from pain, and whether that pain originates inside
or outside the psyche is inconsequential. Because of the threat that
indigeneity presents to the phantasmatic wholeness of settler
colonialism, settlers must always remain suspended in a state of
arrested development between these defensive positions.]{.underline}
Despite any pretensions to the contrary, [the settler is necessarily a
parochial subject who continuously coils, reacts, disavows, and lashes
out, when confronted with his dependency on indigenous peoples and their
territory. This psychic precarity exists at the core of the settler
subject because of the unending fear of its own dissolution, should
indigenous sovereignty be recognized.]{.underline} Goeman writes as an
explicit challenge to other indigenous peoples, but this holds true to
settler-allies as well, that [decolonization must include an analysis of
the dominant 'self-disciplining colonial subject']{.underline}. 73
However, as this discussion of subjective precarity demonstrates, the
degree of to which these disciplinary or phenomenological processes are
complete should not be overstated. For settler-allies must also examine
and cultivate the ways in which settler subjects fail to be totally
disciplined. Evidence of this incompletion is apparent in the subject's
arrested state of development. [Discovering the instability at the core
of the settler subject, indeed of all subjects, is the central conceit
of psychoanalysis]{.underline}. This exception of at least partial
failure to fully subjectivize the settler is also what sets my account
apart from Rifkin's. His phenomenology falls into the trap that
Jacqueline Rose observes within many sociological accounts of the
subject: that of assuming a successful internalization of norms. From
the psychoanalytical perspective, the 'unconscious constantly reveals
the "failure"' of internalization.74 As we have seen, within settler
subjects this can be expressed as an irrational anxiety that expresses
itself whenever a settler is confronted with the facts regarding their
colonizing status. Under conditions of total subjectification, such
charges ought to be unintelligible to the settler. Thus, [the process of
subject formation is always in slippage and never totalized as others
might suggest]{.underline}.75 Because of this precarity, [the settler
subject is prone to violence and lashing out; but the subject in
slippage also provides an avenue by which the process of settler
colonialism can be subverted -- creating cracks in a phantasmatic
wholeness which can be opened wider. Breakages of this sort offer an
opportunity to pursue]{.underline} what Paulette Regan calls [a
'restorying' of settler colonial history and culture, to decanter
settler mythologies built upon and within the dispossession of
indigenous peoples.]{.underline}76 [The cultivation of these cracks is a
necessary part of decolonizing work, as it continues to panic and thus
to destabilize settler subjects. [Resistance to]{.mark} [set]{.mark}tler
[col]{.mark}onialism does not occur only in highly visible
moments]{.underline} like the famous conflict at Kanesatake and
Kahnawake,77 [it also [occurs in reiterative and disruptive practices,
presences, and speech acts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Goeman correctly
observes that the '[[repetitive practices of everyday life']{.mark} are
what [give settler spaces their meaning]{.mark}, as they provide a
degree of naturalness to the settler imago and its psychic
investments.78 As such, [to disrupt the ease of these repetitions
is]{.mark} at once [to striate radically the otherwise smooth spaces
of]{.mark} [set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism [and]{.mark} also [to
disrupt the easy (re)production of the settler
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}. Goeman calls [these subversive acts [the
'micro-politics of resistance']{.mark}, which historically took the form
of 'moving fences, not cooperating with census enumerators, sometimes
disrupting survey parties' amongst other process.]{.underline}79 [These
acts [panic the subject that is disciplined as a product of settler
colonial power]{.mark}, by forcing encounters with the sovereign
indigenous peoples that were imagined to be gone. [This reveals to the
settler]{.mark}]{.underline}, if only fleetingly, the [[violence that
founds and sustains the settler colonial
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}. While such practices may not
overthrow the settler colonial system, [[they]{.mark} do [subvert its
logics by insistently drawing attention to the ongoing presence of
indigenous peoples who refuse erasure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, we
can draw similar inspiration from the variety of tactics used in
movements like Idle No More. [From flash mobs in major malls, to round
dances that block city streets, and even projects to rename Toronto
locations, Idle No More is engaged in a series of micro-political
projects across Turtle Island]{.underline}.80 [[The micro-politics of
the movement strengthen indigenous subjects and their spatialities,
while leaving an indelible imprint in the settler
psyche]{.underline}]{.mark}. Predictably, rage and resentment were
provoked in some settlers;81 however, Idle No More also drew thousands
of settler-allies into the streets and renewed conversations about the
necessity of nation-to-nation relationships. With settler colonial
spaces disrupted and a relationship of domination made impossible to
ignore, in the tradition of centuries of indigenous resistance, Idle No
More put the settler subject into serious flux once more.

[The notion of spatialization as an operation of power relations offers
a fruitful way in which to think about settler coloniality.]{.underline}
In this section, I interrogate the logic of spatiality that is at the
core of settler colonization; to achieve this, I take three approaches.
First, I situate Edward Soja's account of spatiality as both socially
produced and socially productive. After this, I move toward Mishuana
Goeman's (re)appropriation of Soja, wherein she reads his work through
the settler colonial context. Finally, I extract some observations on
the ways in which indigenous peoples interact with and in settler
colonial spaces. Soja's Postmodern Geographies is widely regarded as a
foundational text in spatial theory. [The central observation of the
text, and the consensus which Soja strives to overcome, is the
inter-generational tendency amongst theorists and social scientists
alike to treat space as 'fixed, dead, \[and\]
undialectical']{.underline}. 18 That is to say that [space is generally
conceptualized as an inert zone in which subjects interact with one
another, but the space itself is inconsequential beyond its passive
hospitality. Against this, Soja suggests that space must be understood
as 'a substantiated and recognizable social product' which becomes part
of a subject's 'second nature' as they incorporate both physical and
psychological imprints of the space they occupy.19 As such, the spaces
that we inhabit 'both reflect and configure' our 'being in the
world'.]{.underline} 20 While Soja leaves this statement somewhat
undertheorized, [the phenomenon he describes is common to our experience
of spaces constructed for social purposes that require modifications of
our usual behavior: reverence in a sanctuary that houses the sacred,
joviality in a bar where revelers gather, or somberness in a cemetery
where the dead sleep.]{.underline} Yet, it is usually the case that no
institutional authority enforces our compliance with these norms;
judicial punishment is rarely received for profanities muttered in a
church, misanthropic pub-dwelling, or graveside snickers. Instead, we
police ourselves, or are policed by others, to show these spaces their
'proper' respect. Thus, [far from being inert zones, spaces actively
shape daily life: on the relatively banal level of conducting movement,
but also in the extraordinary sense of informing sociable
behavior.]{.underline} So, it might be noted that [while spatiality is
unquestionably constructed, it is also constructing. That is, building
within communities and subjects a naturalized sense of how things 'are'
and ought to be]{.underline}. Soja's analysis has further relevance to
the discussion here as he provides several markers by which we can begin
to think through the spatialization of mass society. In a lengthy
excerpt from an interview of Michel Foucault's, Soja extracts an
observation that is striking in its simplicity: [communal life,
regardless of its particularities, is impossible without adequate and
appropriate space]{.underline}.21 Not only does power exist when a
multiplicity of subjects commune together, but, as we have seen, power
must also arise from the space of communing itself -- as it molds the
subjects' sense of the possible. Thus, Foucault sounds the charge that a
'whole history remains to be written of spaces -- which would at the
same time be the history of powers'. 22 In the contemporary world, one
need not look far to find evidence of this fact. As Soja observes,
[states are territorial institutions explicitly 'engaged in the
reproduction of a particular social spatialization', often merely as an
exogenous effect of the exercise of state power]{.underline}.23
Moreover, [states are themselves given shape and character by the
spatial order over which they claim jurisdiction]{.underline}. As with
all power, however, [spatiality is neither pure nor innocent; this is
especially true, as we have SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES]{.underline} 43
[already begun to see, in the case of settler states and
spaces]{.underline}. While Soja offers a serious reflection on
spatiality, reviving it from the untimely conceptual grave to which it
had been consigned by many settler scholars, his work fails to deeply
story the spaces he studies. For this reason, I turn to Goeman's work
which engages in a rich spatial discourse, while keeping the history of
settler colonization at the center of her analysis. In Mark My Words,
Goeman adopts Soja's theorization of spatiality, but reads it into the
space of settler colonialism which was previously unaddressed. As we
have seen, Soja observes that, [for most thinkers, space is assumed to
be an inert zone and, pursuant to this, that the discipline of geography
should be treated as a purely descriptive study]{.underline}.24 While
Soja makes a somewhat convincing case, Goeman rejects a crucial elision
that is near to the core of his position. In his rush to decry the
marginality of geography, Soja's analysis leaves unacknowledged the
domineering dichotomy inherent to settler colonialism. This silence
allows for the unproblematic (re)production of knowledges that do not
require the settler geographer to recognize their own position as being
embedded within the power structures of settler coloniality. [Encounters
between indigenous peoples and settler geographers produce an
understanding within the former party that descriptive geography is
embedded deeply within, and is integral to, the project of settlement
and dispossession. Indeed]{.underline}, as Goeman notes, [indigenous
peoples have long known that settler colonies depend on mapmakers as a
'tool to ... enable the assertion of political force'.]{.underline} 25
As has been noted, [settler colonialism necessitates the erasure of
alternative ways of being, and this drive is abetted in part by the
purportedly objective knowledges produced within disciplines like
geography]{.underline}.26 Perpetuation of the myth that
[geographers]{.underline} have ever acted as merely descriptive agents
further naturalizes settler geographic discourses, which are at once
discourses fully implicated in histories of dispossession. As Goeman
states so clearly, in their [tendency to be taken as true
representations of what 'is' '\[m\]aps are preeminently a language of
power']{.underline}. 27 The power that inheres in a map is readily
apparent when we consider how educational maps continue to perform a
nearly total erasure of indigenous peoples from history. Many of the
standard maps used in Canadian history texts -- and hosted on Library
and Archives Canada's website -- demarcate the borders of the British
colonies that went on to become Canada without any acknowledgment of the
presence of sovereign indigenous peoples.28 [While thumbnails of
ambiguously 'First Nations' or unnamed territory peak onto the western-
or northern-most edges, these maps almost uniformly occlude the
ubiquitous presence of indigenous peoples, much less their sovereign
authority throughout Turtle Island.]{.underline}29 Such maps also elide
the treaties between indigenous nations and settlers as they imply the
territorial supremacy of European powers. [The formalization of this
type of representation into a disciplined knowledge produces a sense
within settlers that the territory is objectively theirs by
right.]{.underline} [Claims made to the contrary by indigenous peoples
seem random, irrational, and fleeting to settlers.]{.underline} Goeman
reveals that Soja's genealogy of spatial thinking glosses a critical
truth: that [within settler colonial contexts, the deadening of space --
that is, supporting a view of space as fixed, dead, and undialectical --
is the project of socially producing spatiality. Settler colonialism
requires, at least initially, that spatiality be addressed in purely
descriptive terms: producing 'closed, categorized, and defined spaces'
in order to naturalize the settler and erase the claims of indigenous
peoples.]{.underline}30 [The claim by settler geographers to study space
with objective detachment is meant to place their work within the realm
of rationality and simultaneously to code indigenous space as
mystification.]{.underline} Thus, we see again the conceit of the
settlers' inevitable ascendance over indigenous peoples, as it is
expected that what is 'rational' is sure to declare victory in a final
calculus. While he calls for a social understanding of spatiality,
Soja's work recapitulates the myth that settler geography has ever been,
or could ever be, purely descriptive work. [From the perspective of
indigenous peoples resisting settler colonization, the more purely
descriptive the study of space purports to be, the more subtly it props
up settler knowledges about the land as the only possible way of
understanding a space.]{.underline} Rather than reiterating Soja's call
for a new social spatial theory, Goeman takes seriously the social
production of space by descriptive geography, and demands 'decolonized
spatial knowledges' instead.31 [A new social spatial theory that
purports to re-enliven understandings of space will recuperate the
settler colonial project if it does not attend to the role that the
discourse of 'fixed, dead, \[and\] undialectical' spaces has in
producing the knowledges of social spaces that facilitate settler
colonial occupation and hegemony.]{.underline} Soja asserts that 'an
integral part of the instrumentality of political power' is an
experience of spatiality as coherent and homogenous.32 However, this
depiction of spatiality as ontologically smooth is rooted inexorably in
the experiences of subjects that are embedded within and wedded to
dominant power structures. In truth, [the further a subject is removed
from centers of power and the more capable they are of turning away from
said power, the more likely they are to experience the dissonances of a
given spatial order. This seems especially true in the case of
indigenous peoples, as they are always the implicit targets of the full
violence and discord produced by settler spaces. Settler colonialism
produces a 'spatial schema' wherein the bodies, speech acts, and
cultural milieu of indigenous people are marked as not
belonging]{.underline}.33 As Goeman writes, [within the logic of settler
colonialism, indigenous peoples might exist in space, but never in
place. 34]{.underline} That is to say, that [although indigenous peoples
occasionally rise into visibility for settlers, this occurs with the
assurance that they remain unrooted and spectral -- a quaint reminder of
what is no more]{.underline}.35 Thus, [the indigenous experience of
settler spaces is not one of coherence at all, rather it is at once a
cacophony of oppressive powers that serve to mark indigenous peoples as
always already out of place and of productive powers that infuse the
actions of settlers with intelligible meaning. These two operations of
power naturalize the violence of settler colonization, (re)producing its
spaces and its subjects.]{.underline}

### Forensic ecology

**Forensic ecology is an analysis of state violence through a lens of
slow violence that situates itself between the dead and the living, the
visual and the linguistic---a "chain of custody" that materializes
assemblages of sites, actors, and agents, human and non-human, that
coalesce as forensic evidence.**

Forensic Ecologies of Slow Violence In an essay written a number of
years ago, '"Super Visum Corporis": Visuality, Race, Narrativity and the
Body of Forensic Pathology', [I examined the intersection of law,
visuality and narrativity in the field of forensic pathology. Citing a
legally canonical directive to Coroners, that 'a casual glance at the
face of the dead body \[is\] not sufficient \[for a postmortem\]. The
\[body\] has to be "examined for marks of violence or evidence of the
occasion of death"']{.underline}, [I worked to delineate the techniques
of visuality that bring the dead body into visibility and the series of
mediations that make it intelligible in terms of forensic
evidence]{.underline} (Pugliese 2002, p. 367). [[In the face of the dead
body, and in the absence of its living voice]{.mark} and testimony, [the
forensic pathologist is compelled to act as an intermediary between the
dead and]{.mark} the [living]{.mark}. [The forensic pathologist proceeds
to mediate between the visual]{.mark}---what is visible---[and the
linguistic]{.mark}---the telling of the visible--- [labouring to
transmute the 'wordless']{.mark} corporeal signs of traumata [into the
evidentiary narrative of the written autopsy
report]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this essay, [[I transpose this]{.mark}
analytical [model of forensics to sites marked by]{.mark} the operations
of Israeli [state violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, let me stress,
even as I transpose the model of forensics to the context of the
Israeli-occupied Palestinian Territories, I refuse to reproduce the
discipline's insistence on deploying a scientistic and objectifying lens
in the analysis of its 'objects' of inquiry. Rather, [[I inscribe my
forensic analyses with the]{.mark} very elements and [techniques that
the discipline outlaws]{.mark} and disavows: [the]{.mark} structuring
and inescapable [influence of]{.mark} embodied [affect, tropology and
narrativity.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[My analysis]{.mark} of forensic
ecologies [can be seen]{.mark}, for example, [as]{.mark} enacting the
forensic pathologist's equivalent of [attempting to constitute a 'chain
of custody]{.mark}' precisely [by materialising]{.mark} the discipline's
disavowed [narratological assemblage]{.mark} of trace
evidence;]{.underline} simultaneously, [[my forensic analysis]{.mark}
also [works to bring to the fore the disavowed]{.mark}, because
embodied, affects that ineluctably 'contaminate' the production of this
same trace evidence; [these embodied affects]{.mark}, I contend, [cannot
be]{.mark} wholly [eliminated from the operations of any]{.mark}
rational or objective [analysis.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[A chain of
custody is]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [narratologically [constituted by
a narrator,]{.mark} spatio-temporal markers, effaced yet constitutive
rhetorical elements [and the]{.mark} complex [interplay between sites,
actors and agents that enable an entity]{.mark}]{.underline} (for
example, as I discuss below, a deflated child's football, remnant of a
drone strike) [[to become intelligible]{.mark} precisely [as a form of
forensic evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pugliese 2002, p. 371). The
concept of forensic ecologies builds on Eyal Weizman's (2011, p. 10)
work on Forensic Architecture. In his theorisation of Forensic
Architecture, Weizman brings into focus 'the work of expert witnesses
who present structural analysis in a legal context. Their practice
combines the principles of property surveying, structural engineering,
the physics of blast forces, and the chemistry of composite materials.
In that sense, Forensic Architecture is the archaeology of the very
recent past, but it must also be a form of assembling the future'.
Forensic Architecture is now playing a critical role in uncovering and
evidencing the secretive yet devastating role of drone strikes
(Garkavenko 2014). [[I want to expand]{.mark} Weizman's concept beyond
architecture, and the attendant borderlands that continues to inform
[his analytical model, in order to encompass the larger
ecologies]{.mark} within which buildings (or their ruins) are situated,
and [to move the discussion to the larger assemblage of non-human
entities]{.mark} [that]{.mark} at any time [constitute a]{.mark}
particular [forensic ecology that has been subjected to]{.mark} the
exercise of [state violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Forensic ecologies
are what emerge after the]{.mark} traumatic [impact of explosive
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}---for example, a drone missile strike in
an agricultural field[. [In the wake of this blast]{.mark} of explosive
violence, [the]{.mark} field and its [larger ecology begin to
seep]{.mark}]{.underline} what Rob Nixon (2011, p. 199) terms '[[slow
violence']{.mark}. Slow violence]{.underline}, writes Nixon (2011, p.
199), [is [what inscribes 'ecologies of the Aftermath']{.mark}: it is
'[a violence that is dispersed across time and space]{.mark}, [an
attritional violence]{.mark} that is typically not viewed as violence at
all.]{.underline} [[Violence is]{.mark} customarily [conceived as an
event]{.mark} or action [that is immediate in time, explosive and
spectacular]{.mark} in space, and as [erupting into]{.mark} instant
[sensational visibility']{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is]{.mark} explosive
or [fast violence that grabs our attention]{.mark} and that works to
signify as violence as such]{.underline}. Nixon (2011, p. 2) calls for a
focus on precisely what escapes these doxic understandings of violence:
'[[We need]{.mark} ... [to engage a different kind of violence]{.mark},
[a violence that is]{.mark} neither spectacular nor instantaneous, but
rather [incremental]{.mark} and accretive, [its]{.mark} calamitous
[repercussions playing out across]{.mark} a range of [temporal
scales]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}. In what follows, I work to track
the unfolding of slow violence as it continues to ramify across the
forensic ecologies of Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem.

**A Forensic ecology allow us to search for forensic ruins that are
elliptical blueprints for decolonization**

Elliptical Blueprints for the Future In the wake of the geographies of
dispossession that this essay has chronicled, I want to end on a note of
tenuous hope. [The forensic ecologies]{.underline} that I have
documented evidence the enormity of the loss that Palestinians [have
endured in the face of the colonising and expropriative
violence]{.underline} of the Israeli state. [Yet these ecologies of loss
also signify otherwise: their forensic remainders]{.underline}---rubble,
a child's punctured football, a lemon tree---[emerge from the context of
ruins as elliptical blueprints that memorialise, materially and
affectively, what must be restituted and made whole again in the time to
come]{.underline}. I qualify [these forensic remainders as elliptical
blueprints]{.underline} [for the future because their wholeness has been
shattered by the violence]{.underline} of Israeli military, police and
settler assault. [Their fragile presence is figured by gaps and
absence]{.underline}. Their lacunae are what must be filled by the
Palestinian survivor's memory. Hala retraces the elisions of her
enforced dispossession and displacement through her keening memory and
its rootedness in her beloved lemon tree. She reconstructs a history and
an inheritance otherwise denied her. Her patrimony takes the shape of a
lemon tree laden with an abundance of golden fruit. It beckons from her
past and it projects her into a future that is enabled by the very
presence of her tree: 'You see', she says, '\[we\] visit the lemon tree
a lot, and even apologize that we are not close to her, and ask her to
take care of the house' (quoted in Shalhoub-Kevorkian 2014, p. 15)---*in
anticipation of their return*. Even in their fractured and broken state,
[these forensic remainders enunciate a material refusal]{.underline} to
sanction the Israeli state's politics of Palestinian obliteration. [The
materiality of this refusal articulates a cultural politics of obdurate
survivance and immanence-as-resistance]{.underline}: rubble, a child's
football or a lemon tree signify perduration that outlives all attempts
at eradication. In the face of the Israeli state's violent practices of
occupation, erasure and colonial resignification of Palestinian land,
homes and places, these [forensic remainders stand as disconsolate but
enduring mnemonic signs that gesture toward]{.underline} a projected
Palestinian future of [emancipation and reclamation]{.underline}.
[Emerging from an archaeology of ruins, they adumbrate what is otherwise
negated by the colonising apparatus]{.underline} of the Israeli state:
[they are evidentiary traces of what has been, what survives and what
must be restituted]{.underline} to the Palestinian people.

[[In attempting to theorise a communal and ecological understanding
of]{.mark} the experience of [suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} that
challenges anthropocentric circumscriptions, [I want to underscore [the
critical necessity to articulate a different order of entities]{.mark}
that evidences not a binarised subject/object world, but [a world
of]{.mark} differentially but still [mutually constitutive
actors]{.mark}.]{.underline} I use 'actor' here in Bruno Latour's (2004,
p. 226) extended sense: 'things might authorize, allow, afford,
encourage, permit, suggest, influence, block, render possible, forbid
and so on, in addition to "determining" and serving as a backdrop to
human action'. [Complicating and attenuating reductive
conceptualisations of cause and effect, Latour (2004, p. 226) advocates
agency in non-human objects and things: '[anything that modifies a state
of affairs]{.mark} by making a difference [is an
actor']{.mark}]{.underline}. Latour here can be seen to be part of that
larger theoretical formation that has come to be known as '[thing
theory', a theory that, in a nutshell, acknowledges and valorises the
agency of non-human entities in the world and argues 'that things too
are vital players in the world']{.underline} (Bennett 2004, p. 349).
Even as I affirm the importance of 'thing theory' in marking humans'
acknowledgement of the agency of non-human entities in the world, [I am
troubled by the very title of the theory as, precisely, oriented by the
thing. The use of the problematic term 'thing' brings into critical
focus the hegemonic hold of Euro-anthropocentric language-thought and
the manner in which it works insistently to undermine, through its
objectifying lexicon, the very possibility of speaking and thinking
otherwise about the world.]{.underline} I mark this hegemonic hold
precisely because it continues to inscribe my own language-thought even
as I attempt to unsettle its grip: as will be seen in what follows, my
essay is marked by the very inadequation of my language to an aspired
deanthroprocentrising thought. [And I qualify this linguistic-conceptual
regime of anthropocentrism as Eurocentric precisely because other
nonEuropean peoples mobilise different cosmologies that do not reproduce
this dichotomous subject/object, human/non-human understanding of the
world. Even as she fails to interrogate the problematic term 'thing',
that names her reconceptualisation of the relation between different
entities, Jane Bennett proceeds to offer an evocative way of thinking
through this relation.]{.underline} She writes of [[the 'autopoetic
flow' that enables]{.mark} a 'wide variety of [mobile configurations':
This is]{.mark} not [a world]{.mark}, in the first instance, of subjects
and objects, but [of various materialities]{.mark} constantly [engaged
in a network of relations.]{.mark} It is a world populated less by
individuals than by groupings or compositions that shift over
time.]{.underline} (Bennett 2004, p. 354) In the course of this essay,
[I attempt to materialise the complex autopoetic flow between various
entities in order to bring into focus affective relations that challenge
the circumscriptions of anthropocentric thought]{.underline}. I draw on
the term 'entity', in contradistinction to 'thing', as, by definition,
it works to encompass the plenitude of materialities that exist in the
world without reproducing the subject/object position of the term
'thing'. In the term 'entity', the subject that is being referred to
remains indeterminate in its specificity and it cannot be immediately
categorised in the hierarchical taxonomies of anthropocentric thought
that position human, animal, vegetable, mineral and so on in a
categorical descending order. In my conceptualisation of the panoply of
nonhuman entities in the world as also, in Latour's sense, actors in the
world, I no doubt will be charged with indulging in flagrant acts of
anthropomorphism. I am not sure what it means to write outside the
inescapable frames of rhetoric and its constitutive repertoire of
tropes---metaphor, prosopopoeia or personification and so on---except,
of course, by lapsing into catachrestic forms that found their very
facticity and literality on the denegated bodies of dead metaphors.
Standing at the juncture of tropology and catachresis, I can only avow
one thing: that outside the frames of anthropocentric and
anthropomorphising language there still reside entities which are not
reducible to the same. I do not come to this knowledge through an act of
faith. It is what is conveyed to me experientially through my daily
engagement with the entities that comprise my world. Even as they are
rendered intelligible through my assimilating language, my discursive
configurations and repertoire of tropes, they persist in remaining other
to my epistemologies and ontologies and, in Levinasian terms, they
continue to signify otherwise---even as we stand in relations of
proximity. [[The]{.mark} ethical [reorienting of human-nonhuman
relations]{.mark} that Bennett and others call for is not predicated on
collapsing the difference between the two. Rather, 'It [emphasizes the
shared material basis, the kinship]{.mark}, of all things, [regardless
of]{.mark} their [status]{.mark} as human, animal, vegetable, or
mineral' (Bennett 2004, p. 359). [This is the sort of worldview
that]{.mark}, as I mentioned above, [has been so clearly articulated by
a number of the world's Indigenous cultures]{.mark}, including

We observe that another component of a desire to play Indian is [**[a
settler desire to be made innocent]{.underline}**, **[to find some mercy
or relief in face of the relentlessness of settler guilt and
haunting]{.underline}**]{.mark} (see Tuck and Ree, forthcoming, on mercy
and haunting). **[[Directly]{.underline}]{.mark}** and indirectly
**[[benefitting from the erasure and assimilation of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a difficult reality for settlers to
accept. **[The]{.underline}** weight of this **[reality is
uncomfortable]{.underline}**; the misery of guilt makes one hurry toward
any reprieve. In her 1998 Master's thesis, Janet Mawhinney analyzed the
ways in which **[white people maintained]{.underline}** and (re)produced
**[white privilege in self-defined anti-racist settings and
organizations]{.underline}**.8 She examined the role of storytelling and
self-confession - **[which serves to equate stories of personal
exclusion with stories of structural racism and
exclusion]{.underline}** - and what she terms 'moves to innocence,' or
"strategies to remove involvement in and culpability for systems of
domination" (p. 17). Mawhinney builds upon Mary Louise Fellows and
Sherene Razack's (1998) conceptualization of, 'the race to innocence',
"the process through which a woman comes to believe her own claim of
subordination is the most urgent, and that she is unimplicated in the
subordination of other women" (p. 335). Mawhinney's thesis theorizes
**[the self-positioning of white people]{.underline}** as
**[simultaneously]{.underline}** **[the oppressed and never an
oppressor]{.underline}**, and as having an absence of experience of
oppressive power relations (p. 100). This simultaneous self-positioning
afforded white people in various purportedly anti-racist settings to say
to people of color, "**[I don't experience the problems you do, so I
don't think about it]{.underline}**," and "**[tell me what to do, you're

follows, we will do some work to identify and argue against a series of
what we call 'settler moves to innocence'. **[[Settler moves to

that **[[attempt to relieve the settler of feelings of guilt or

**[[settler scholars may gain professional kudos or a boost in their

discomfort in our settler readers, may embarrass you/us or make us/you
feel implicated. Because of the racialized flights and flows of settler
colonial empire described above, settlers are diverse - there are white
settlers and brown settlers, and peoples in both groups make moves to
innocence that attempt to deny and deflect their own complicity in
settler colonialism. **[When it makes sense to do so, we attend to moves

people. []{.mark}In describing settler moves to innocence, our goal is
to provide a framework of excuses, distractions, and diversions from

length than others, mostly because some require less explanation and
because others are more central to our initial argument for the
demetaphorization of decolonization. [We provide this framework so that
we can be more impatient with each other, less likely to accept gestures

### A2: Essentialism

#### Criticisms of essentialism proliferate authoritarian practices and sanction the inequality they seek to mitigate. 

**Coulthard '14** - Glen Coulthard is a member of the Yellowknives Dene
First Nation and is an assistant professor in the First Nations Studies
Program and the Department of Political Science at the University of
British Columbia. (Coulthard, Glen Sean, 1974-. Red Skin, White Masks :
Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition. Minneapolis :University
of Minnesota Press, 2014.)//Kian

I n this chapter I explore in detail the second cluster of concerns
often associated with the politics of recognition briefly identified in
my introductory chapter. **[These [criticisms]{.mark} have tended to
focus [on the empirically problematic and normatively suspect character
of recognition claims based on "essentialist" articulations of
collective identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to social
constructivist proponents of this line of critique, [when claims for
cultural accommodation are grounded on essentialist expressions of group
identity they can too easily be deployed to justify repressive and
authoritarian demands]{.underline} for group compliance on the one hand,
or sanction unjust practices of exclusion and marginalization on the
other. [[Without certain guaranteed rights and state institutional
mechanisms in place to ensure that problematic cultural norms and
practices remain open to democratic deliberation and group contestation,
it has been argued that the self-determining status of subaltern
individuals within minority groups]{.mark}---especially women and
children---will remain at risk.]{.underline} Recognizing that social
constructivist critiques of the politics of culture and identity
encompass a vast range of theoretical and disciplinary perspectives, in
this chapter I will focus more narrowly on the work of political
theorist Seyla Benhabib, whose contribution represents what I see as an
important yet problematic attempt to bridge the gap between the insights
afforded by social constructivist theory and what she views as the
deliberative norms and processes that ought to guide and frame
democratic practice. 1 In doing so, I argue that **[Benhabib's
anti-essentialist critique works in concert with a statist feature of
her deliberative democratic theory, which functions to inadvertently
sanction colonial hierarchies.]{.underline}** This argument can be
broken into the following two claims. First, I contend that when
examined through the lens of Indigenous peoples' struggles, Benhabib's
[[social constructivist critique]{.underline}]{.mark} of the politics of
recognition tends to [[not only overestimate the emancipatory potential
of anti-essentialist criticism, but]{.underline}]{.mark} more
importantly it [also [fails to address the full breadth of power
relations]{.mark} that often serve to proliferate exclusionary and
authoritarian community practices]{.underline} and articulations of
identity to begin with. In this regard, I align my work with the growing
number of scholars who have begun to critically interrogate
anti-essentialist criticism when uniformly applied to a range of
conceptually distinct and power-laden contexts.2 My second claim is
directed more squarely at the statist character of Benhabib's
deliberative democratic critique of the politics of recognition. Here I
contend that when anti-essentialist theories of cultural identity are
projected as a universal feature of social life and then employed as a
justificatory measure for evaluating the legitimacy of claims for
recognition within and against the uncontested authority of the colonial
state, they can inadvertently sanction the very types of domination and
inequality that both social constructivist and deliberative democratic
projects ought to mitigate. This is especially the case with respect to
Indigenous claims for recognition, which often throw into question,
either implicitly or explicitly, the legitimacy of the state's assumed
role as arbiter in contestations over recognition. This chapter is
organized into four sections. The first section provides a brief sketch
of the constructivist critique of the politics of recognition Benhabib
offers in The Claims of Culture: Equality and Diversity in the Global
Era. As with my previous engagement with Charles Taylor in chapter 1,
[although I focus largely on Benhabib's work here, many of the
conclusions reached in this section are by no means limited to her
contribution alone]{.underline}. In the second section, I provide a
history of Indigenous women's struggle against sexist provisions of the
Indian Act and an examination of the ways in which this history of
struggle informed an Indigenous feminist critique of the gendered
dynamics underwriting the decade-long (1982--92) effort of mainstream
Aboriginal organizations to secure a constitutional right to the
self-government in Canada. In the next section, I argue that, although
Benhabib is correct to highlight the ways in which preservationist
claims to cultural recognition can and have been used by male segments
of colonized societies to justify oppressive gender practices, her
critique fails to adequately address the colonial context within which
these practices have come to flourish. And finally, in the last section,
I argue that insofar as Benhabib's theory uncritically positions the
colonial state as a legitimate adjudicator of Indigenous recognition
claims[, [her argument is itself ironically premised on
the]{.mark}]{.underline} racist/[[essentialist assumption that
Indigenous peoples were so uncivilized at the time of European
contact]{.underline}]{.mark} that they did not constitute
self-determining subjects in relation to the states that eventually
asserted sovereignty over them

### A2: "It's Good For Indigenous People"

- A2: plan good for native

[SCT is most usefully understood as providing non-Indigenous people in
settler states with a better account of ourselves -- rather than as an
account of the entire settler--Indigenous relationship.]{.underline} It
explains more of who we are than previous approaches, but it is not
coincident with all that we are, and is not able to explain the entire
encounter between Indigenous and settler peoples. [Most clearly of all,
it does not account for Indigenous lives -- the assertion that it could
do so is itself allied to the settler colonial impulse to erase
Indigenous life and assert settler control of this discursive
space.]{.underline} Settler logics, political priorities and processes
have structured much of the settler-Indigenous relationship in the past
and present. [For this reason, settler colonialism must be studied as an
historical and empirical phenomenon as well as a conceptual
framework]{.underline}. [However, settler processes do not constitute
these relationships in their entirety, and more importantly, they do not
necessarily determine the range of possibilities available in our
futures]{.underline}. It is [crucial that we continue to challenge the
politically convenient conflation of settler desires and reality and of
the political present and the future, asking always whose interests are
served by this new and more sophisticated settler colonial
fantasy.]{.underline} Veracini rightly observes that 'the decolonization
of settler colonialism needs to be imagined before it is practised, and
this has proved especially challenging.' 89 However, we do not need to
imagine this process on our own. SCT can show us our own frames of
reference -- and this by implication assists us to understand and engage
with what lies outside them. [Settler colonialism posits that two
political societies cannot exist in one place through time, and that one
must necessarily replace the other --]{.underline} either by settlers
extinguishing Aboriginal difference or by Aboriginal people expelling
settlers (an option rarely countenanced). [It imagines that two
societies remaining together must always be an inherently problematic
state, leading those within it to seek an end. Settler colonialism
assumes the inevitability of its own colonizing actions in such a
circumstance. But even within Western traditions, it is possible to
imagine other ways that two societies might behave and be in one
place.]{.underline} If we decide [to look outside our own frameworks,
and engage with Indigenous people and ideas, we might find even richer
political possibilities.]{.underline} SCT provides us with a number of
insights and resources that enable us to use it well. [It reveals our
own partiality and investments, and traces connections between our
individual identities as scholars and broader colonial
processes]{.underline}. SCT cannot substitute for an engagement with
Indigenous people or for an awareness of our own complicities, but it
can help us towards these goals. [It explains and exposes the operation
of colonial dynamics and processes where these are routinely obscured or
denied]{.underline}. In identifying and naming these systems, [SCT
provides us with a range of important opportunities -- including the
capacity to name and contest settler interests, challenge the
problematization of Indigenous peoples, and identify prospects for
different kinds of resistance.]{.underline} The moment that SCT reveals
colonization as ongoing is not necessarily the moment we must give up
hope of change. It could, in fact, be the moment that settler
colonialism is revealed as one, very limited, way of understanding and
organizing our reality.

### A2: land grab

#### Land-grabbing is the status quo -- fear that it "could get worse" is a ruse of recognition to legitimate continuity

As mentioned previously, [many Native studies scholars]{.underline} have
refused engagement with ethnic studies or critical race theory because
they think such engagement relegates Native peoples to the status of
racial minorities rather than as members of sovereign nations. Yet, even
as Native studies articulates its intellectual framework around
sovereignty, some strands within it also [presume the continuance of
settler colonialism]{.underline}. Glen Coulthard sheds light on this
contradiction in noting that in the name of sovereignty, Native nations
[have shifted their aspirations from decolonization to recognition from
the settler state]{.underline} (Coulthard 2007). [That is, they
primarily articulate their political goals in terms of having political,
economic, or cultural claims recognized or funded by the settler state
within which they reside. In doing so, they unwittingly relegate
themselves to the status of "racial minority," seeking recognition in
competition with other minorities]{.underline} seeking the same thing.
[One example can be found in the work of Ward Churchill]{.underline}.
Churchill offers searing critiques of the United States' genocidal
policies toward Native peoples and calls for "decolonizing the Indian
nations" (Churchill 1983, 202). Nevertheless, [he contends that we must
support the continued existence of the U.S. federal government because
there is no other way "to continue guarantees to the various Native
American tribes \[so\] that their landbase and other treaty rights will
be continued"]{.underline} (Churchill 1983, 1). [Thus, in the name of
decolonization, his politics are unwittingly grounded in a framework of
liberal recognition whereby the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[will continue to exist as the arbiter and guarantor of indigenous
claims. In such a framework, Native peoples compete with other groups
for recognition]{.underline}. For instance, in some of his work
Churchill opposes a politics that would address racism directed against
nonindigenous peoples, arguing that Native peoples have a special status
that should take primacy over other oppressed groups (Churchill 1983,
419). Such analyses do not take into account how the logics of settler
colonialism are enabled through the intersecting logics of white
supremacy, imperialism, heteropatriarchy, and capitalism. [Consequently,
when Native struggles become isolated from other social justice
struggles, indigenous peoples are not in a position to build the
necessary political power to actually end decolonization and
capitalism]{.underline}. Instead, they are set up to be in competition
rather than in solidarity with other groups seeking recognition. This
politics of recognition then presumes the continuance of the settler
state that will arbitrate claims from competing groups. When one seeks
recognition, one defines indigenous struggle as exclusively as possible
so that claims to the state can be based on unique and special status.
In contrast, if one seeks to actually dismantle settler colonialism, one
defines indigenous struggle broadly in order to build a movement of
sufficient power to challenge the system. (As I discuss later,
indigenous peoples' struggles in Latin America that are based on a
politics of decolonization have articulated indigeneity as an expansive
rather than an exclusive category.)

### A2: "Canada is different"

#### The attempt to separate the different settler colonial nations makes it impossible to fully analyze it as a structure- Goeman 13

(Mishuana Goeman, Tonawanda Band of Seneca, assistant professor of
gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mark My
Words: Native Women Mapping Our Nations. University of Minnesota Press,
2013. pg(s). 21 DH)

I start this book shortly after the signing of the 1870s Medicine
Treaties and the corralling of Native people onto reservations as if
they were wild animals needing containment. Not coincidently, it was
also in 1876 that Canada became a confederation, severing its ruling
ties to the metropole of Britain. [Academics have too often separated
the Native policies of Canada and the United States and not explored
junctures of power that support ongoing spatial violence]{.underline}. I
contend that, [while we must scrutinize the particularities around how
each nation-state has incorporated and expunged Natives, and must do so
at the local scale as well, it is also important to examine how
inflicted violence supported suppression and Colonization throughout the
Americas.]{.underline} In this instance, the brutal physical violence
inflicted by the U.S. Army led to signing of treaties and brutally
forcing Native people onto reservations. Many of these Native nations
traditional homelands spread into what is now known as Canada and
Mexico. The restrictions placed and enforced by the U.S. Army helped to
settle the southern borderlands of Canada and the northern boundary
lands of Mexico, Cities grew, white immigration flourished, and the
colony no longer needed to rely on Britain for military protection. [The
settler nation-states of the Americas, in recognizing one another\'s
boundaries and overlooking colonial violence, legitimate the settler
state as an entity while overlooking the injustices toward Native people
under its guise of the affairs of a sovereign nation. While mapping was
indispensable to brute colonization of Native land in North America
through genocide, it is at this point colonial logics took a spatial
turn that changed the everyday practices of Native people. Colonial
governmentality articulated and implemented structures that would
regulate Native spaces and Native bodies through a variety of state
practices. Family, clan, and intra- and intertribal relationships were
reformulated in ways readable to the state.]{.underline} The authors
with whom I work address the severing of these relationships by the
pounding discipline of state force. Once territories and land were
claimed by Western empires turned settler states, violent state
practices were read as internal affairs. It is in this era I begin my
project.

#### Re-centers the whiteness Simpson 16

(Leanne Betasamosake, Mississauga Nishnaabeg, \"Indigenous resurgence

I get [**[that]{.underline}**]{.mark} first type of
[**[question]{.underline}**]{.mark} about **[[what settlers can
do]{.underline}]{.mark}** a lot and [**[I hate it because it erases
everything I\'ve said]{.underline}**]{.mark} in my talk and **[[tries to
recenter the talk on whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark}**; we need to stop
providing the space for that. [We have to create material bases for the
nationhoods we want. We can\'t rely on the culture that capitalism
creates.]{.underline} We just can\'t. [We can\'t achieve Indigenous
nationhoods while replicating antiblackness. We can\'t have resurgence
without centering gender and queerness, and creating alternative systems
of accountability for sexual and gender violence. Therefore, We need to
create constellations of connections with other radical thinkers and
doers and makers. We need to build mass movements]{.underline} with
radical labor, with Black communities, with radical communities of
color. We need to stop providing space for the \"What can white allies
do\' questions and set up spaces where we can connect with other social
movements and create constellations of mutual support and co-resistance.
My experience as an Indigenous Woman is With colonialism, settler
colonialism, occupation and gender violence, and connecting with radical
Black feminists, for instance, is rich ground for me because we have
different but intimately related experiences with white supremacy. I
watched the recent Black Radical Tradition conference online and I
thought, WoW, these comrades are thinking and Writing similar things to
me and my Indigenous comrades and maybe there is something in that. Not
that I Want to take and exploit their intellectual Work, but more of a,
hey-they have their shit together, they have public intellectuals, they
have movements on the ground. They aren\'t afraid to talk about the root
of things. [That\'s why resurgence is so important]{.underline}. I am
not particularly interested in holding states accountable because the
structure, history, and nature of states is exploitative by nature. I\'m
interested in alternatives, I\'m interested in building new Worlds.
That\'s not to say that movements that are Working to hold states
accountable should do something differently only they would know that.
It\'s not my place to critique that. I\'m saying on a very personal
level, this is not where my skills and thinking lie. [I Work exclusively
with Indigenous peoples and theoretically my thinking and Work is based
in Indigenous resurgence. Indigenous peoples standing up on our lands in
a principled, strategic, and articulate Way, embodying change, is a
fundamentally different approach than begging the colonizer for their
pity, or centering whiteness in solidarity or in allyship. We are not
relying on victim narratives. We need to come at this from a place of
principled strength having done the Work, and We need to have the backs
of other communities and movements, instead of continuing to dance for
whiteness. There are other movements doing a better job of this right
now than we are. Grounded normativity has no space for exploitation,
heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, or antiblackness.]{.underline}

### A2: SCT wrong

#### Our binary theorization is empirically and experientially proven -- their denial is itself complicit

**Wolfe 13** (Patrick Wolfe, writer and historian, held appointments at
various universities, including La Trobe University, Harvard University,
Stanford University and the Universities of Melbourne and New Orleans,
"Recuperating Binarism: a heretical introduction," Settler Colonial
Studies, 3(3-4), 2013, DOI 10.1080/2201473X.2013.830587, p.257-264)KMM

[In the]{.underline} contemporary Western [academy]{.underline},
especially [in the USA, the repudiation of binarism partakes of a
certain sacredness]{.underline}. Not only are its premises
unquestionable, though they certainly are. More strictly, and in keeping
with Durkheimian fundamentals, the repudiation of binarism expresses
membership of a collectivity that constitutes the source and origin of
righteousness. Hence the heat that typically accompanies its enactment.
An identification is at stake. In notable contrast to the customary
wordiness of scholarly interchange, the repudiation in question is
[typically expressed with emphatic brevity, the charge of binarism
constituting one of the more conversation-stopping items in academic
theory's inventory of reprimands]{.underline}. Despite the semblance of
consensus, however, a dissenting positionality persists. [As one who
argues that **settler colonialism** is premised on a **zero-sum logic**
whereby settler societies, for all their internal **complexities**,
**uniformly require the elimination of Native alternatives**, I have
regularly been accused of binarism -- though not once by a
Native]{.underline}. Why should it be that the spectre of binarism, so
disturbing to nonNative sensibilities, should be less troubling to
Natives? More provocatively, could it be that [the **repudiation of
binarism represents a settler perspective**]{.underline}? To the extent
that this may be the case, [the heat that the issue generates is
revealing. It takes us directly to the **affective dimensions of settler
subjecthood**]{.underline}, a conflictual realm that many of the essays
in the first volume of this special collection opened up.1 To situate
settler subjecthood historically, we can start with the frontier. For
all its empirical inadequacy, the concept of the frontier has the virtue
of expressing the protean fact of a historical coming together of
societies that had previously been mutually discrete. Prior to a certain
point or points, their separateness had been unqualified. In our
theoretical enthusiasm at the complexities, hybridities and
transgressions that the study of frontiers opens up, therefore, we
should not lose sight of the fact that, [for all the holes and
inconsistencies in the concept, its primary **referent is stable
enough**. Behind all the indeterminacy]{.underline}, the frontier is [a
way of talking about the **historical process of territorial invasion**
-- a cumulative depredation through which outsiders recurrently advance
on Natives in order to take their place. Go back far
enough]{.underline}, in other words, [and there can be **no disputing
the existence of an unqualified empirical binarism**]{.underline}. [The
question is not, therefore, one of the ground for binarism, but one of
where and when -- if at all -- the originary binarism became dissolved
or transcended]{.underline}. Significantly, scholars of the doctrine of
discovery have not questioned the polarity of Natives and Europeans, so
we can take it that the requisite historical rupture -- assuming it
occurred -- was postponed for some centuries in the wake of Columbus.2 A
breakthrough, if such it can be called, came in the USA in the form of
the Marshall court's concept of domestic dependent nationhood, which
decisively compromised the inconvenient binarism hitherto presupposed in
the formalities of separate national sovereignties. In failing to
distinguish adequately between Indian sovereignty and that assigned to
European nations, the embryonic republican legal system had set US and
Indian sovereignties in counterpoint to each other. Cherokee v. Georgia
downgraded that theoretical symmetry, encompassing Indian sovereignty
within and below that of the USA without jettisoning the language of
statecraft.3 In so doing, the judgement adapted the horizontal
vocabulary of international relations to the vertical reality of
domination.4 As such, Marshall's pluralist innovation was emphatically
unilateral. It expressed conquest, which hardly undoes opposition.
Despite the rhetoric of coexistence, in other words, the judgements in
no way undid the binary reality. Rather, the rhetoric of coexistence
served as an instrument of conquest, as the Jacksonian removals that
coincided with the judgements so brutally demonstrated. Accordingly, far
from a historical rupture, the Marshall episode suggests that the denial
of binarism may itself constitute an instrument of conquest. Moreover,
in the contemporary US academy, Marshall does not lack apologists.5
Where, then, is the rupture? [The primal binarism that is maximally
visible during the era of the frontier subsequently **becomes less and
less visible** in settler-colonial discourse -- which]{.underline}, as
Lorenzo Veracini has pointed out, **[persistently seeks its own
transcendence through declaring itself a thing of the
past]{.underline}**.6 [In the wake of the frontier]{.underline} -- and
here at least I agree with Frederick Jackson Turner -- something very
important happens. The end of the frontier marks the end of the
centuries-long process whereby [Natives have been being transformed,
spatially at least, from outsiders into insiders. They have become
surrounded by, and contained within, settler society]{.underline}.
Typically, this is a drawn-out process. Removal only postpones it.
[Sooner or later, the land hungry, the diggers of gold, the extractors
of oil]{.underline}, the scalpers, the doggers, the sex workers, the
pastoralists, the railroad men and the farmers -- Turner's [whole litany
of types -- arrive at the boundaries of the substitute homelands to
which Natives have been removed and the process starts all over
again]{.underline}, aggravated by the fact that, the second or third
time around, Natives' ties to their land are that much less robust.7 In
the wake of this protracted historical containment, with no external
threat to necessitate maintaining the formalities of international
diplomacy, settler discourse seeks to shift Native Affairs out of the
realm of international relations and reconstitute it internally as a
depoliticised branch of the welfare bureaucracy.8 To this end,
post-frontier settler policy typically favours assimilation, a range of
strategies intended to separate individual Natives from their collective
sovereignties and merge them irrecoverably into the settler mainstream.
[Without minimising the catastrophic long-term death rates that settler
colonialism has brought about, therefore, we should **not view the logic
of elimination as solely a drive to exterminate** Native human
beings]{.underline}. [Rather]{.underline}, as Colonel Richard Pratt was
well aware, [the irreconcilable Native difference that settler polities
seek to eliminate can be detached from the individual, whose bare life
can be reassigned within the set of settler social categories, a
**social death of Nativeness**]{.underline}.9 Hence the demonisation of
Indigenous collectivity in the immediately post-frontier Dawes-era USA,
which persisted until John Collier devised a scheme, incorporated in the
1934 Indian Reorganisation Act, whereby tribal organisation might itself
be domesticated.10 As in the case of Marshall, this strategy sought to
neutralise Natives' irreducible externality to the settler social
contract. In both cases (Marshall and Collier), tribal autonomy would be
diminished through incorporation rather than opposition. This situation
prompts me to register an appreciative disagreement with Veracini, who
has aptly pointed out -- my disagreement being with his inference rather
than with the point itself -- that settlers bring their sovereignty with
them.11 This enables Veracini [**to distinguish between settlers and
immigrants**, the latter being those who do not bring a sovereignty with
them. On its own terms, this distinction seems **questionable** (where,
for instance, does it leave White settlers of Irish
descent?)]{.underline}. **[Even assuming]{.underline}** Veracini's
[triadic scheme, however (settlers, immigrants and Natives), **Natives
remain distinct as the only bearers of sovereignties that exceed the
monistic version that settlers imported with them**, immigrants having
abandoned or been made to forfeit their own. This awkward fact has
**prompted settler authorities' repeated attempts to represent the
unilateral as consensual**. **In the USA**, from the treaty era onwards,
Natives have been subjected to a **recurrent cycle of inducements** --
allotment (held out as personal endowment), citizenship, tribal
enrolment, termination (held out as individual freedom), and
self-determination -- each of which has sought to present domination as
empowerment and thereby **assert Natives' consent to their own
dispossession**. Not only is this situation **inherently binary** but a
**preoccupation common to these policy alternations**, which have all
sought to incorporate Natives either individually or collectively, has
been the **suppression of that very binarism**]{.underline}. [To this
extent, the post-structuralist **indictment of binarism endorses
colonial policy-making**]{.underline}. Thus [it is naïve, if not
consciously **complicit, for academic discourse to recapitulate
multiculturalism's claim to have subverted a binarism** of White vs. the
rest. Rather, multiculturalism maintains settler authorities' historical
suppression of Indigenous specificity into the so-called 'post-racist'
era]{.underline}. As we have seen, [frontier history raises the question
of when, if at all, the colonial binarism became diluted or
pluralised]{.underline}. Assimilationists do not doubt its persistence.
Rather than when the original binarism became diluted, they want to know
how it can be diluted in the present. [Thus the matter goes to the core
of the politics of **academic representations**]{.underline}. In
deploying its administrative resources to suppress Native difference,
settler discourse concedes institutional life to the very problem it
seeks to eliminate. For something to be suppressed, it must first exist.
By its very charter, an Office of Indian Affairs or an Aborigines
Department attests to the persistence of the Native problem. During the
era of the frontier, this is only to be expected. Territory, together
with its Native population, remains to be conquered, so there remains an
acknowledged external threat that requires institutional management. In
the wake of the frontier, however, the continued need for institutional
management becomes anomalous, attesting as it does to the persistence of
a refractory externality that proclaims conquest not to be complete
after all. [To the extent that **conquest remains
incomplete**]{.underline}, as Alissa Macoun and Elizabeth Strakosch
suggest in their chapter below, the settler state rests -- or, more to
the point, fails to rest -- on incomplete foundations. Here, [then, is
an **affective ground for the settler anxiety that binarism provokes**:
it signals incompleteness. In seeking to internalise the Native problem,
the settler state seeks to complete itself. This requirement is
independent of simple demographic numbers. It **persists so long as
uncontained alternative sovereignties**, areas of incompleteness,
**persist within the bounds of the settler polity**. To **contain these
alternatives** -- to complete its polity -- settler discourse seeks to
**depoliticise them**. To this end, a key strategy is to **conflate the
Native problem with internal disorders** such as crime, insanity and
cognate forms of delinquency or neglect. For the external to be rendered
internal, in other words, the **political is rendered
technical**]{.underline}. A well-known, if premature, example of this
device was the transfer of the US Office of Indian Affairs from the War
Department to the newly created Department of the Interior, which took
place in 1849, when the US Cavalry had barely set hoof on the Great
Plains.12 The transfer's prematurity was consistent with settler
expansion. It expressed a desire for completion. As such, it prefigured
the rash of anti-tribal initiatives, mopping-up for operations for
civilisation, which rapidly complexified US Indian affairs
administration in the Dawes years following the end of the frontier.
[The more the Native question is problematised, however, the less it
goes away. In mobilising against Native specificity, settler discourse
inadvertently supplements Native agency, chronically reinscribing the
frontier in domestic discourses ostensibly addressed to technical means
rather than political ends. Thus abetted, the Native repressed
insistently returns to haunt post-frontier settler
culture]{.underline}.13 [This **confounding of attempts to negate the
Native/settler binary is a phenomenon of considerable
generality**]{.underline}. [I have more than once cited a striking
example of assimilationist propaganda to illustrate the extension of
eliminationist logic into Australian domestic discourse]{.underline}.14
I return to the example here for two reasons: [first, for comparative
purposes, to connect my earlier analysis to the **cross-cultural
observation** (between **Australia** and the **USA**)]{.underline} that,
[in the post-frontier era, **settler authorities characteristically seek
to depoliticise Indigenous externality through rendering it a technical
problem for civic administration** and, second, for analytical purposes,
to illustrate]{.underline} the new point [that settler **attempts to
suppress the Indigenous binary** are **inherently contradictory** and,
as such, are **more likely to sustain their object than to suppress
it**]{.underline}. In 1947, A.O. Neville, who for the preceding quarter
century had served as Protector of Aborigines for the state of Western
Australia, published an exculpatory memoir entitled Australia's Coloured
Minority: Its Place in The Community. In Australian parlance of the
time, 'coloured' referred to people whose biological ancestry
encompassed both Native and settler components. The proposition that
such people should be in 'the' (i.e. White people's) community
distinguished them from 'full-blood' Aboriginal people, who were
classified as external to settler society. On the basis of this
elementary assimilationism, Neville had presided over an official
campaign of child abduction, whereby countless Indigenous children,
generally of relatively light complexion, had been taken from their
families without warning or pretence of consent, typically by force or
by stealth, the express intention being their merger into White society.
Though the post-war context in which his book appeared was dominated by
news of the Nuremberg trials, with negotiations over the terms of
Raphaël Lemkin's proposed genocide convention in full swing at the newly
established United Nations, the principal problem that Neville
acknowledged for his policy was not its genocidal nature. Rather, he was
concerned that candidates for adopting the stolen children could be
deterred by the prospect of atavistic throwbacks, whereby subsequent
generations of their putatively White families might produce Black
offspring. To allay this concern, Neville presented the following
illustration. Duly buttressed by anthropological technicalities, this
image was intended to show that, given successive admixtures of
Whiteness, Aboriginal genes could be expected to recede evenly through
the generations (Figure 1). 15 \[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\] For the purposes of
my present argument, the key factor in this picture is its numerical
limit. Aboriginality ends with the boy. To the left of him (his right),
all is Whiteness. Thus the racial arithmetic ('full', 'half', etc.) is
not an expression of static degrees. Rather, it is a three-generational
lap count to extinction. This, then, is the settler-colonial logic of
elimination in one of its discreetly technocratic post-frontier
modalities. [Despite the **semblance of plurality** in the hierarchical
arrangement of the depicted subjects, their internal variety serves to
maintain the fundamental cut-off separating them from]{.underline} the
[Whiteness]{.underline} that extends, invisible and unqualified, from
the left-hand edge of the picture. Neville's illustration was intended
to vouchsafe an elementary binarism that claimed intermediate anomalies
for the dominant pole. On its surface, Neville's fractional mathematical
idiom directly parallels blood quantum discourse in the USA. [Moreover,
as various scholars and activists have pointed out, the outcome -- the
**attrition of Indigenous numbers -- is also consistent**]{.underline}.
While this consequence of blood quantum has been well critiqued,16 the
idiom's operative terminology remains largely unexamined. Why, in
particular, mathematics, and why its particular combination with blood?
Posing the question thus highlights the simple fact that blood, being
liquid, readily lends itself to quantification. It would be impossible
to calibrate, say, culture or politics with comparable precision. As
such, blood is well adapted to sustain the technical vocabulary that, as
observed, supplants the political language of international relations in
post-frontier settler discourse. As in the case of skull measurement,
the politics are overwhelmed by the objective technicalities of
numerical reasoning.17 Thus blood quantum perfectly satisfies the
requirements of a political ideology. As classically formulated by Marx
and Engels, ideologies have two primary characteristics: they legitimate
the hegemony of a particular social group, and they do so by
assimilating that hegemony to nature, which places it beyond human
intervention.18 As a measurable liquid, blood straightforwardly
constitutes an object of natural science, a quality that powerfully
legitimates blood-quantum discourse's furtherance of the
settler-colonial logic of elimination. [A related consequence of blood
quantum's mathematical phrasing is more specific to the **suppression of
binarism**]{.underline}. As we saw in the Neville illustration, [the
**proliferation of fractions** can **obscure the priority of the
division separating Natives from settler society**. In the USA, this
effect is hyperelaborated in the Bureau of Indian Affairs's
blood-quantum reckonings]{.underline}, which reflect the exigencies of
tribal enrolment and titular succession from the allotment rolls that
were instituted at the dawn of the twentieth century. Though terms such
as 'full-blood', 'mixed-blood' and 'half-breed' had been common enough
for most of the nineteenth century, it was not until Dawes commissioners
confronted the problem of determining which Indians should be entitled
to individual allotments of reservation land, and of what extent, that
these casual designations came to acquire mathematical refinement. This
development can be dated, with some precision, from the year before
Turner published his seminal essay on the frontier.19 Writing in 1892,
Indian Affairs Commissioner T.J. Morgan distinguished the rigorous
quantifications that the administrative requirements of tribal allotment
had necessitated from the looser usage of earlier eras.20 Back in 1856,
Morgan declared, it had been enough for AttorneyGeneral Caleb Cushing
simply to recommend that: 'half-breeds (and in his opinion he seems to
use the expressions half-breeds and mixed-bloods interchangeably),
should be treated by the executive as Indians in all respects so long as
they retain their tribal relations'. 21 So unfamiliar was his
refinement, however, that Morgan proceeded immediately to ignore it,
going on to refer to Chief John Ross, whose detractors never tired of
pointing to his seven white great-grandparents, as 'a Cherokee chief,
who was a half-breed'. 22 In the event, [Morgan's innovation was to have
disastrous consequences for the thousands of Indians who found
themselves excluded (or, with political misjudgement, excluded
themselves) from the Dawes rolls]{.underline},23 [an eliminatory effect
that was subsequently compounded by the additional blood-quantum
provisions that would accompany tribal enrolment under the Indian New
Deal of the 1930s]{.underline}.24 Blood quantum furnished a
post-frontier analogue to the Vanishing Indian. Thus it was not only on
the surface that the BIA's mathematical idiom resembled Neville's
Australian formula, for which it constitutes a precedent. In either
case, [racial arithmetic **provided for the social death of
Nativeness**]{.underline}. It would be hard to find a more extreme
example of numerical fractions obscuring a governing binarism than the
obsessively elaborated sanguinary catalogue that was still being
included in a fieldworkers' manual put out by the Phoenix, Arizona,
office of the BIA in 1984 (Figure 2): \[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\] [This
**morbid excess of reason** -- which would surely stretch the point
beyond credibility had it not actually been issued for official use --
exemplifies the **statistical overwhelming of binarism with manic
clarity**]{.underline}. While the chart conspicuously specifies, in the
box outlined in bold in the bottom left-hand corner, that 'N.I. means
Non-Indian', only one of its 593 classifications (the one at top left)
is actually occupied by the designation 'N.I.'. 25 The other 592
classifications all denote descending degrees of Indianness. The
governing discrimination, in relation to which all the others are
hierarchically organised, is that designating the monolithic
self-sufficiency of the Non-Indian category, a classificatory black (or
White) hole that systematically draws the smaller fractions of
Indianness into itself. Beneath the bamboozling variety of its surface,
this chart actually provides for two cardinal categories, Indian and
Non-Indian. Unqualified and self-sufficient, the lone monolith in the
top left-hand corner, like the Whiteness extending invisibly beyond the
left-hand edge of Neville's illustration, is a cut-off that reinscribes
the frontier in contemporary bureaucratic procedure. In comparison to
the Australian example, however, the category 'Non-Indian' is notable
for its ethnic versatility. To establish themselves, the Australian
colonies did not import enslaved people.26 Rather, the coerced labour
put to work in Australia was initially provided by convicts, an almost
exclusively White group who did not transmit their condition to
succeeding generations. As a result, the racial politics of Australian
settler society have developed very differently from the situation in
the USA. In keeping with the aims of the White Australia Policy,
Aboriginal assimilation provided for a departure from Aboriginality that
was simultaneously an entry into Whiteness. The two were synonymous.
Whiteness was the only destination. In the USA, by contrast, there were
other destinations. In particular, the post-slavery 'one-drop' rule
provided for Indigeneity to be overwhelmed by Blackness as well as by
Whiteness -- a situation that has not only been exploited by settler
society but, of late, by some Native groups as well.27 Thus comparison
with the US example enables us to clarify an ambiguity in settler
discourse that is left unresolved in the Australian case. Native
assimilation is not primarily a recruitment into Whiteness. If that were
so, it would be hard to see its purpose, as supplementary White people
can be acquired more easily through immigration. Rather, Native
assimilation is primarily an elimination of Indigeneity. In the case of
Indians being made Black under the provisions of the one-drop rule, two
ethnocratic goals are achieved simultaneously: Indian elimination and
White racial purity. Those who promote racist exclusions within Indian
tribes might do well to reflect on this consideration. [The **semblance
of plurality** that emerges from assimilation's extravagant mathematics
is **not**, of course, **without foundation**. As groups of
**immigrants** who have arrived under widely varying dispensations, from
bondage to subsidised passage, settler societies typically evince a high
degree of **internal heterogeneity**]{.underline}. Indeed, this was the
focus of the first volume of this collection. [**But the existence of
major differentiations within settler (and**, for that matter, within
**Native) societies does not alter the binary nature of the
Native/settler divide**. The respective differentiations are of
different orders]{.underline}. [In this connection, it is important not
to be misled by voluntarism. The **opposition between Native and settler
is a structural relationship rather than an effect of the will**. The
fact that I, for example, am an Australian settler is **not** a product
of **my individual consciousness**. Rather, it is a **historical
condition** that **preceded me**. Neither I **nor other settlers can
will our way out of it, whether we want to or not**. No doubt our
respective individual consciousnesses affect how each of us responds to
this shared historical positionality, but they did not create it and
they cannot undo it. The fact that enslaved people immigrated against
their will -- to cite the most compelling case for voluntarism -- **does
not alter the structural fact** that their **presence, however
involuntary, was part of the process of Native
dispossession**]{.underline}. White convicts also came against their
will. Does this mean that their descendants are not settlers? There
could hardly be a better illustration of the determinate nature of
structural relations than the recent report that the Jewish Agency has
been recruiting Native Peruvians from Iquitos, in the Amazonian
rainforest, to bolster the population of Israeli colonies in occupied
Palestine. Allegedly, the recruits in question trace their descent from
a group of Mizrahi Jews from the Maghreb who migrated to the Amazon
region in the nineteenth century to work in the rubber industry. More
than 250 are reported to have arrived in the 1990s, with a further 100
currently having their applications considered by the Israeli Interior
Ministry.28 Regardless of the outcome of the Israeli Interior Ministry's
deliberations (the Jewish Agency has reportedly been asked to supply
'complementary' evidence in relation to the group), the mere possibility
of Natives from one country being enlisted as settlers in a different
people's country demonstrates the supra-individual, structural
contingency of the designations 'Native' and 'settler'. It also
highlights the error of essentialising Nativeness. The state of being
Native is not an inherent quality that individuals carry anywhere with
them. In addition to its cultural and political dimensions, it is
structural and site-specific. Circumstances permitting, there is nothing
to prevent colonised Natives from one region becoming settlers in a
different region (think, for instance, of Native American soldiers
stationed in Hawai'i). It is very important to note that this does not
entail a statement about either the historical fortunes or the moral
worth of (in this case) putatively Jewish-Amerindian individuals.
Regardless of the conditions that motivated their dealings with the
Jewish Agency, their presence in occupied Palestine would take space and
resources away from Native people, a consequence that would not be
affected by the conditions they encountered on arrival. From the 1950s
on, when recently arrived Arab-Jews (Mizrahim) were relegated to
marginal transit camps (ma'abarot), Israel made a practice of populating
frontier areas with low-status immigrant groups.29 Such divisions are,
however, internal to Israeli settler society. They do not affect the
subordinate groups' participation, willing or otherwise, in the colonial
process. Whatever differences may distinguish the individual motivations
of stigmatised Mizrahim (or, for that matter, Peruvians) from the
eliminationist fanaticism of army-backed religious settlers, they share
the historical situatedness of being part of the process of Palestinian
dispossession.

### 2AC -- Perm

#### Imagining a repurpose of geopolitical power is good -- only the permutation solves

In this section, we are going to discuss, on the basis of study results,
why this thesis matters. So far, this introductory chapter has sought to
illustrate, among other things, [that [the relationships between power
and geography are]{.mark} both constitutive and
[practical]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[The recognition of the ontological
bond between geography and power means that [there cannot be]{.mark}
such a thing as [geography-free policy-making]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Since all policies are set up by human subjects, they reproduce
spatially constituted social reality, even if it is
unintended]{.underline} (Lefebvre 1991; Thrift 1983; Zieleniec 2007).
However, the ontological link between power and geography does not speak
much about the efficiency of reproduction that this thesis studies
(study I--IV). [The efficiency normally requires more or less
rationalised intervention. This means that geographical knowledge is
systematised, reasoned, and conceptualised considering certain
(political) purposes]{.underline}. In this thesis this process is
defined as spatial imagination (study I). [The practices through which
imagined geography]{.underline} \[spatial imaginations\] [can enhance
the efficiency of targeted actions such as policies include not only
(re- )organising of a geographical knowledge according to some rational
grounds and/or ideological perspectives, but also planning and
coordination as well as considering the interdependence between
policies.]{.underline} In all of this, the challenge that policy makers
face regarding the use of geography is definitely complex, and this is
where the collaboration with geographers could be welcomed both in forms
of policy-relevant research and the participation of well-trained
specialists (Harvey 1974; Massey 2001). David Harvey (1984, 7) has once
declared that [**[ʻGeography is too important to be left to
geographers]{.underline}**. [But it is far too important to be left
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [generals, [politicians]{.mark}, and corporate
chiefs̕]{.underline}. Still, it is often lamented by academic geographers
that expected collaboration between geographers and policy makers has
been woefully limited (Murphy 2006; Peck 1999; Ward 2007). [In
particular, it has been claimed that geographers tend to provide policy
studies that ʻgenerate knowledge about the policy process but are of
limited relevance in terms of contributing knowledge to the policy
processʼ]{.underline} (Rydin 2005, 74--75). It seems that the [[spatial
analyses regarding policy processes often tend to be rejected by power
centres]{.mark} as types of stories that could have some value as
interesting intellectual exercises but lack the coherence with
prearranged models of policy performance.]{.underline} There are
different reasons why policy makers tend to look at spatial knowledge as
other than needful for feeding technologies of spatial governance with
persistent suspicion. Firstly[, [spatial analyses offer]{.mark}
[knowledge and expertise that]{.mark} often [push for radical
change]{.mark} in the ways in which policies should reproduce a social
reality. These claims are not necessary ideological or structural, as is
the case with,]{.underline} for example, the [works of radical Marxist
geography, but rather categorical.]{.underline} [The mantra that [space
matters in policy-making can be true but it cannot be
absolute]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Geographical research regarding policy
processes is]{.mark} just [one]{.mark} possible [way to reveal
shortcomings in policy-making]{.mark}, but there are always others, and
more commonplace ways also in the market.]{.underline} The second
problem is related to poor communication. [Some scholars have complained
that spatial analyses of policy processes have a tendency to be
theoretically saturated and ambiguous with regard to methods and
conceptual apparatus]{.underline} (Martin 2001). **[The lack of
theoretical transparency and misunderstandings regarding basic concepts
can make it difficult to convince an audience that considering the
spatial knowledge could add some extra quality for policy
formation.]{.underline}** As a result, spatial factors are often seen by
policy makers as secondary compared to, for example, economic or
ethnocultural ones, if enhancing of the efficiency of policy-making is
at stake (Peck 1999). The third and no less important problem is
translation. The majority of geographical analyses which have the
ambition to provide practical knowledge for policy processes tend to be
highly context-sensitive. This is so because spatial factors are never
universal in the sense that they ʻ(re-)actʼ differently in different
places. As such, the knowledge that the studies provide is not always
easily adaptable and applicable for other political formations, even if
the policy performance takes place on a comparable scale of governance
(cf. Banks & MacKian 2000; Martin 2001). In addition to the sp[ecific
character of geographical knowledge and occasionally confusing
approaches used for policy analyses, the deficit of policy-relevant
geographical research is due to academic standards, which makes it
unattractive for geographers to politicise their research and establish
an open dialogue with policy makers (]{.underline}Dorling & Shaw 2002;
Murphy 2006; cf. Beaumont et al. 2005). Contrary to the prevalent
attitude, however, some authors have suggested that the proper way to
enhance the attractiveness of geography studies regarding policy
formation is to integrate them with policyrelevant agendas. For example,
Jakob & Marques (2014, 28) have emphasised that ʻresearch without a
political project (why) and applicable ideas (how) will continue to
trail behind in its practical relevanceʼ. [[This plea is partly based on
the view that social scientists,]{.mark} including human geographers,
[cannot just distance themselves from policy cycles]{.mark} and policy
formation by avoiding ideologically sensitive themes and ignoring the
dialogue with society]{.underline} (Woods & Gardner 2011). [Hanging on
the belief that academic immunity guarantees the reliability of social
research is illusory because social research, even if it is conducted at
a very abstract level, can never be politically neutral.]{.underline} In
the end, [whether the knowledge can be declared politically innocent
depends on the contexts in which it is used]{.underline} -- for whom,
when and what the produced knowledge applies. Furthermore, the changing
power relationships between academic and governance spheres occurring
during the last decades in many Western countries undermine the myth of
academic neutrality even more clearly. As a result, scholars are
witnessing academic and social pressure to do contract works for
governance institutions and participate in shaping policy through
various expert groups and consulting. It is also worth mentioning that
we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that much of academic studies is
still directly financed from governmental funds and, as such, is
monitored and evaluated by politically responsible officials and
experts. Considering this, some authors have suggested that geographers
could take more responsibility and control over their research outcomes.
This means, for example, that geographical studies about policy
processes could be politically positioned and targeted by framing them
with ʻdiscussion of the political and practical goals that the
researchers are trying to achieveʼ (Jakob & Marques 2014, 26).

### 2AC---flattening

#### Their framing argument ontologizes settlerism, which reifies settler political control and is used to justify evading political action -- settler violence is not inevitable and not all actions are settlerist, so judge our DAs based on their relative truth

\*SCT=Settler Colonialism Theory

Despite these powerful contributions, we also identify some important
issues associated with SCT in Australian academic debates about the NT
intervention. The first is **[a direct consequence]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [one of]{.underline} **[SCT's vital
contributions]{.underline}**, [arising from the theory's present tense
**iteration of settler colonialism.**]{.underline} [By [emphasizing
**continuities** in **colonial relationships**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[between the past and the present]{.underline}, **[SCT [can depict
colonization as structurally inevitable]{.mark},]{.underline}**
[[and]{.mark} can be deployed in ways that **[re‐inscribe]{.mark}
settler [colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We suggest that [SCT's
struggle to narrate its own ending can be countered by approaching the
theory as an account of settler desires which makes visible our own
frames of reference]{.underline}. This in turn exposes a range of
possibilities and political visions outside these frames. **[Such an
approach is significant in countering potentially problematic misuses of
SCT that erase its location as a settler discourse]{.underline}**. Such
erasures problematically empower academics to speak with neutral
descriptive authority over both settler and Indigenous realities.
Firstly, by disturbing settler colonialism's narratives of progress, SCT
attributes a peculiar suspended temporality to the settler project. This
can portray settler colonialism as an inevitable structure likely to
exist across time -- the fact that the past persists in the present
implies that this past will also persist in the future. Foundational
scholar Patrick Wolfe has been labelled 'very much a structuralist stuck
in a poststructuralist world'.63 As we have outlined, this structuralism
is particularly useful in identifying the operation of political
hierarchies. However, [[it can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[excuse
us]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[human political
[action]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in the present [by presenting
this]{.mark} action [as futile]{.mark} or already
determined]{.underline}**.64 [The role of political activists is to wait
for **the structurally determined future**]{.underline}, [and at most to
prepare **others for its arrival**. The particular challenge of SCT's
[analysis]{.mark} is that it [does not give an account of such a]{.mark}
**transformed [future]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} of [the
conditions for]{.mark} **settler [colonialism's
demise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This can lead to a]{.mark}
**theoretical** and **[political impasse]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
result in a kind of **colonial fatalism**]{.underline}. **[Such
[fatalism can be deployed to imply]{.mark} a [moral equivalence between
different]{.mark} forms of [settler political interaction with
Indigenous people]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[at its worst]{.underline}**, **[to [deny the legitimacy of Indigenous
resistance]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. [Structuralist narratives are able
to posit radical change]{.underline}, [but only if this change is built
into the structures they describe]{.underline} -- for example [because
these structures are subject to internal contradictions or are
inherently unstable]{.underline}. Settler colonial structures, however,
appear as highly stable and 'relatively impervious to regime change'.65
Therefore, at the same moment settler scholars finally see the depth and
reach of settler colonialism in the present they feel unable to find
'postsettler colonial passages'.66 [This tendency is reinforced by SCT's
capacity to identify significant commonalities in the objectives of
conservative and progressive policy approaches]{.underline}, as
discussed above. It shows that traditional 'decolonizing' pathways such
as treaty making, reconciliation and formal apologies may also serve
colonial ends by absorbing and extinguishing Aboriginal political
difference without disturbing the foundational structures of settler
dominance. As Australian anthropologist Deborah Bird Rose notes, this
makes it 'difficult to offer a critique of the colonizing features
without calling into question the whole decolonizing project'.67 [[If
every settler action **is framed as always already
colonizing**]{.underline}, [then **individuals are excused from
anti‐colonial action**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the present and
Indigenous people are **destined to be victims of an unstoppable
colonizing state**]{.underline}.68 [As bell hooks argues]{.underline} in
relation to US race relations, **[[this is useful to those in a position
of dominance]{.mark}:]{.underline}** 'so many White people are eager to
believe racism cannot be changed because internalizing that assumption
downplays the issue of accountability. **[No responsibility need be
taken for not changing something if it is perceived as
immutable]{.underline}**.['69 Is it possible that [settlers are]{.mark}
particularly **[attracted to SCT]{.mark}** precisely [because it
gives]{.mark} us **[a sense of being intellectually committed to the end
of colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[while]{.mark} simultaneously
**[unable to act against our own privilege]{.mark}?**]{.underline} As a
recent article concluded about the prospects for decolonization: I can
only assess this with a degree of gloom. I am yet to be convinced that
we can prevent indigenous disadvantage remaining structurally embedded
in society and through the state even after any kind of 'transition' or
'transformation'. At the same time, I fear decolonization. I am myself a
settler, like several of my ancestors before me, and I have nowhere else
to belong.70 [SCT's structuralism may serve these conflicted
interests]{.underline}, in [allowing us to feel we have done all we can
while facing the 'reality' of an inevitable settler colonial
future]{.underline}. [This structuralism gives many within settler
colonial studies a particular orientation towards Indigenous resistance
and scholarship]{.underline}. Australian scholar Tim Rowse argues that
critical settler perspectives on colonialism can 'reproduce that
sorrowing form of attention in which defeat and marginality are
highlighted at the expense of understanding the nature and limits of the
Indigenous agency that circumstances afforded'.71 **[He and others
suggest that [this]{.mark} sort of [analysis caricatures Indigenous
responses, presenting a false binary between resistance/sovereignty and
co-optation]{.mark} in the colonizing process]{.underline}**.72 This,
[they suggest, leads scholars to position one sort of Indigenous
response as more valid and authentic than others, re‐performing the
authority settlers have always claimed over definitions of Indigenous
reality]{.underline}. Joanne [Barker identifies a 'troubled focus within
settler colonial studies on structure to the erasure of Indigenous
experiences and perspectives about colonialism even within analyses of
the "logic of elimination" that fuels colonial processes of social
formation.]{.underline}'73 SCT may be revelatory to many settler
scholars, but Indigenous people have been speaking for a long time about
colonial continuities based on their lived experiences.74 Some SCTs have
sought to connect with these discussions and to foreground Indigenous
resistance, survival and agency.75 Others, however, seem to use SCT as a
pathway to explain the colonial encounter without engaging with
Indigenous people and experiences -- either on the grounds that this
structural analysis already conceptually explains Indigenous experience,
or because Indigenous resistance is rendered invisible. In these cases,
[the structuralism of SCT theory can be mobilized to **actively
reinforce** settler colonial authority and to participate in the
**attempted erasure of Indigenous independence**]{.underline}. We argue
that Australian scholar Dirk Moses76 deploys SCT in his analysis of the
NT intervention in ways that clearly demonstrate this potential
re‐inscription of colonial authority.77 Moses, perhaps more than some
others, recognizes the radical implications of settler colonial
analysis. He acknowledges that because 'Australia remains a settler
colonial entity,' the Indigenous 'experience of disintegration is
intense ... in the face of a White settler colony determined to
assimilate the "Native" other. Cultural survival is, then, a pressing
issue for Indigenous leaders and intellectuals'.78 In his recent pieces
on contemporary Australian Indigenous policy, Moses deploys postcolonial
and SCT to evaluate the responses of Indigenous intellectuals and
political leaders, leveraging theory and his status as a settler
intellectual to provide an account of Indigeneity. He seeks to both
encompass Indigenous experiences of colonization and offer an assessment
of appropriate Indigenous survival strategies. Ultimately, Moses uses
SCT to argue that, for their own good, Indigenous people must give up
the struggle for survival in order to release themselves from violence
and find freedom and policy agency. In what Moreton‐Robinson has
labelled a form of 'racial ventriloquism',79 Moses uses the work of
African postcolonial theorist Achille Mbembe to suggest that Aboriginal
people should 'inculcate an ethics of responsibility by recalling,
mourning, accepting and transcending the trauma of colonialism'.80 Moses
acknowledges Mbembe is speaking in a formally decolonized context while
Australian Indigenous people are subject to ongoing colonialism, yet
argues that the 'much discussed crisis of remote communities has led
some Indigenous leaders to abandon the liberation narrative' and
therefore the Indigenous

3\. Towards Foucault Instead of side-stepping or seeking to remove the
traces of power from planning, an alternative approach accepts power as
unavoidable, recognising its all pervasive nature, and emphasising its
productive as well as destructive potential. Here, [theory]{.underline}
engages squarely with policy made on a field of power struggles between
different interests, where knowledge and truth are contested, and the
rationality of planning is exposed as a focus of conflict. This is what
Flyvbjerg has called realrationalität, or 'real-life' rationality
(Flyvbjerg 1996), where the focus [shifts from what **should be done**
to what **is actually done.**]{.underline} This analysis embraces the
idea that 'rationality is penetrated by power', and the dynamic between
the two is critical in understanding what policy is about.
[It]{.underline} therefore [becomes meaningless, or misleading - for
politicians]{.underline}, administrators [and researchers alike - to
operate with a concept of rationality in which power is
absent]{.underline} (Flyvbjerg 1998, 164-65). Both Foucault and Habermas
are political thinkers. Habermas's thinking is well developed as
concerns political ideals, but weak in its understanding of actual
political processes. Foucault's thinking, conversely, is weak with
reference to generalised ideals\--[Foucault is a declared opponent
of]{.underline} ideals, understood as [**definitive answers** to Kant's
question, **'What ought I to do?'** or Lenin's **'What is to be
done?'**]{.underline}\--but his work reflects a sophisticated
understanding of Realpolitik. Both Foucault and Habermas agree that in
politics one must 'side with reason.' Referring to Habermas and similar
thinkers, however, Foucault (1980b) warns that 'to respect rationalism
as an ideal should never constitute a blackmail to prevent the analysis
of the rationalities really at work' (Rajchman 1988, 170). Habermas's
main complaint about Foucault is what Habermas sees as Foucault's
relativism. Thus Habermas (1987, 276) harshly dismisses Foucault's
genealogical historiographies as 'relativistic, cryptonormative illusory
science'. Such critique for relativism is correct, if by relativistic we
mean unfounded in norms that can be rationally and universally grounded.
[Foucault's norms are]{.underline} not foundationalist like Habermas's:
they are expressed in a desire [to challenge **'every abuse of power,
whoever the author, whoever the victims'**]{.underline} (Miller 1993,
316) [and in this way 'to give new impetus]{.underline}, as far and wide
as possible, [to the undefined work of freedom']{.underline} (Foucault
1984a, 46). [Foucault]{.underline} here [is the Nietzschean democrat,
for whom any form of government - liberal or totalitarian - **must be
subjected to analysis and critique**]{.underline} based on a will not to
be dominated, voicing concerns in public and withholding consent about
anything that appears to be unacceptable. [Such norms cannot be given a
universal grounding]{.underline} independent of those people and that
context, according to Foucault. [Nor would such grounding be desirable,
since it would entail an ethical uniformity with]{.underline} the kind
of utopian-[totalitarian implications]{.underline} that Foucault would
warn against in any context, be it that of Marx, Rousseau or Habermas:
'The search for a form of morality acceptable by everyone in the sense
that everyone would have to submit to it, seems catastrophic to me'
(Foucault 1984c, 37 quoted in Dreyfus and Rabinow 1986, 119). In a
Foucauldian interpretation, such a morality would endanger freedom, not
empower it. Instead, Foucault focuses on the analysis of evils and shows
restraint in matters of commitment to ideas and systems of thought about
what is good for man, given the historical experience that few things
have produced more suffering among humans than strong commitments to
implementing utopian visions of the good. For Foucault the socially and
historically conditioned context, and not fictive universals,
constitutes the most effective bulwark against relativism and nihilism,
and the best basis for action. Our sociality and history, according to
Foucault, is the only foundation we have, the only solid ground under
our feet. And this socio-historical foundation is fully adequate.
Foucault, perhaps more than any recent philosopher, reminded us of the
crucial importance of power in the shaping and control of discourses,
the production of knowledge, and the social construction of spaces. His
analysis of modern power has often been read by planning theorists as
negative institutionalised oppression, expressed most chillingly in his
analysis of the disciplinary regime of the prison in Discipline and
Punish (Foucault 1979). However, it is [Foucault's explanation of power
as productive and local]{.underline}, rather than oppressive and
hierarchical, that [suggests real opportunities for agency and
change]{.underline} (McNay 1994). Whilst Foucault saw discourse as a
medium which transmits and produces power, he points out that it is also
'a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of resistance and a starting
point for an opposing strategy'. So, at the same time as discourse
reinforces power, it also 'undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile
and makes it possible to thwart it' (Foucault 1990, 101). Foucault
rarely separated knowledge from power, and the idea of 'power/knowledge'
was of crucial importance: ' we should abandon a whole tradition that
allows us to imagine that knowledge can exist only where the power
relations are suspended and that knowledge can develop only outside its
injunctions, its demands and its interests \... we should abandon the
belief that power makes mad and that, by the same token, the
renunciation of power is one of the conditions of knowledge. We should
admit rather that power produced knowledge .. that power and knowledge
directly imply one another; that there is no power relation without the
correlative constitution of a field of knowledge \...' (Foucault 1979,
27). For Foucault, then, rationality was contingent, shaped by power
relations, rather than context-free and objective. According to
Foucault, Habermas's (undated, 8) 'authorisation of power by law' is
inadequate (emphasis deleted). ['\[The juridical system\] is **utterly
incongruous** with the new methods of power,']{.underline} says Foucault
(1980a, 89), 'methods that are employed on all levels and in forms that
go beyond the state and its apparatus\... Our historical gradient
carries us further and further away from a reign of law.' [The law,
institutions - or policies and plans - provide no guarantee of freedom,
equality or democracy. Not even entire institutional
systems]{.underline}, according to Foucault, [can ensure
freedom]{.underline}, even though they are established with that
purpose. Nor is freedom likely to be achieved by imposing abstract
theoretical systems or 'correct' thinking. On the contrary, history has
demonstrated\--says Foucault\--horrifying examples that it is precisely
those social systems which have turned freedom into theoretical formulas
and treated practice as social engineering, i.e., as an epistemically
derived techne, that become most repressive. ['\[People\] reproach me
for not presenting an overall theory,' says Foucault]{.underline}
(1984b, 375-6), ['I am attempting, to the contrary]{.underline}, apart
from any totalisation - which would be at once abstract and limiting -
[to open up problems that are as concrete and general as possible'. What
Foucault calls his ['political task' is 'to
criticise]{.mark}]{.underline} the working of [[institutions which
appear to be]{.mark} both **[neutral and independent]{.mark}**; to
criticise them in [such]{.mark} a manner [that]{.mark} the [political
violence]{.mark} which has always exercised itself]{.underline}
obscurely [through them [will be unmasked]{.mark}, so that one can fight
them']{.underline} (Chomsky and Foucault 1974, 171). [This is what, in a
Foucauldian interpretation, would be seen as an effective **approach to
institutional change**, including change in the institutions of civil
society.]{.underline} With direct reference to Habermas, Foucault (1988,
18) adds: 'The problem is not of trying to dissolve \[relations of
power\] in the utopia of a perfectly transparent communication, but to
give\...the rules of law, the techniques of management, and also the
ethics\...which would allow these games of power to be played with a
minimum of domination.' Here Foucault overestimates his differences with
Habermas, for Habermas also believes that the ideal speech situation
cannot be established as a conventional reality in actual communication.
Both thinkers see the regulation of actual relations of dominance as
crucial, but whereas Habermas approaches regulation from a
universalistic theory of discourse, [Foucault seeks out a genealogical
understanding of actual power relations]{.underline} in specific
contexts. Foucault is thus oriented towards phronesis, whereas
Habermas's orientation is towards episteme. [For Foucault]{.underline}
praxis and [freedom are derived not from universals or theories.
**Freedom is a practice**]{.underline}, and its ideal is not a utopian
absence of power. Resistance and struggle, in contrast to consensus, is
for Foucault the most solid basis for the practice of freedom. [Whereas
Habermas emphasises]{.underline} procedural [macro politics, Foucault
stresses substantive micro politics]{.underline}, though with the
important shared feature that neither Foucault nor Habermas venture to
define the actual content of political action. This is defined by the
participants. Thus, both Habermas and Foucault are 'bottom-up' thinkers
as concerns the content of politics, but where Habermas thinks in a
'top-down' moralist fashion as regards procedural rationality - having
sketched out the procedures to be followed - Foucault is a 'bottom-up'
thinker as regards both process and content. In this interpretation,
Habermas would want to tell individuals and groups how to go about their
affairs as regards procedure for discourse. He would not want, however,
to say anything about the outcome of this procedure. [[Foucault would
**prescribe neither process nor outcome**; he would only recommend **a
focus on**]{.mark} **conflict and [power relations]{.mark}** as the most
effective point]{.underline} of departure [for the fight against
domination.]{.underline} It is because of his double 'bottom-up'
thinking that [[Foucault has been described as **non-action
oriented.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [Foucault]{.underline} (1981)
[says]{.underline} about such criticism, in a manner that would be
pertinent to those who work in the institutional setting of planning:
[It's true that]{.underline} certain [people]{.underline}, such as those
[who work in the]{.underline} institutional setting of the
[prison\...are not likely to find]{.underline} advice or [instructions
in my books to tell them 'what is to be done.' But [my project is
precisely to bring it about that **they 'no longer know what to do,' so
that the acts, gestures, discourses**]{.mark} **that up until then had
seemed to go without saying [become problematic, difficult,
dangerous]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Miller 1993, 235). The depiction of
Foucault as non-action oriented is correct to the extent that [[Foucault
hesitates to give directives for action, and]{.underline}]{.mark} he
**[[directly distances himself from the]{.underline}]{.mark}** kinds of
**[[universal 'What is to be done?' formulas]{.underline}]{.mark}**
which characterise procedure in Habermas's communicative rationality.
[[Foucault believes that 'solutions' of this type
are]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves [**[part of the
problem.]{.underline}** [Seeing Foucault as non-action oriented would be
misleading, however, insofar as Foucault's genealogical
studies]{.underline}]{.mark} [are carried out]{.underline} only in order
[to [show how things **can** be done differently]{.mark} to 'separate
out]{.underline}, from the contingency that has made us what we are, the
possibility of no longer being, doing, or thinking what we are, do, or
think' (Foucault 1984a, 45-7). Thus Foucault was openly pleased when
during a revolt in some of the French prisons the prisoners in their
cells read his Discipline and Punish. 'They shouted the text to other
prisoners', Foucault told an interviewer. 'I know it's pretentious to
say', Foucault said, 'but that's a proof of a truth\--a political and
actual truth\--which started after the book was written' (Dillon 1980,
5). This is the type of situated action Foucault would endorse, and as a
genealogist, Foucault saw himself as highly action oriented, as 'a
dealer in instruments, a recipe maker, an indicator of objectives, a
cartographer, a sketcher of plans, a gunsmith' (Ezine 1985, 14). [The
establishment of]{.underline} a concrete [[genealogy opens
**possibilities** for action by describing the genesis of a given
situation and showing that this]{.underline}]{.mark} particular genesis
[[is not connected to absolute historical necessity.]{.mark} Foucault's
genealogical studies of prisons, hospitals and sexuality demonstrate
that social practices may always take an alternative form]{.underline},
even where there is no basis for voluntarism or idealism. Combined with
Foucault's focus on domination, it is easy to understand why this
insight has been embraced by feminists and minority groups. Elaborating
genealogies of, for instance, gender and race leads to an understanding
of how relations of domination between women and men, and between
different peoples, can be changed (McNay 1992, Bordo and Jaggar 1990,
Fraser 1989, Benhabib and Cornell 1987). The value of Foucault's
approach is his emphasis on the dynamics of power. Understanding how
power works is the first prerequisite for action, because action is the
exercise of power. And such an understanding can best be achieved by
focusing on the concrete. Foucault can help us with a materialist
understanding of Realpolitik and Realrationalität, and how these might
be changed in a specific context. The problem with Foucault is that
because understanding and action have their points of departure in the
particular and the local, we may come to overlook more generalised
conditions concerning, for example, institutions, constitutions and
structural issues. In sum, Foucault and Habermas agree that
rationalisation and the misuse of power are among the most important
problems of our time. They disagree as to how one can best understand
and act in relation to these problems. From the perspective of the
history of philosophy and political theory, the difference between
Foucault and Habermas lies in the fact that Foucault works within a
particularistic and contextualist tradition, with roots in Thucydides
via Machiavelli to Nietzsche. Foucault is one of the more important
twentieth century exponents of this tradition. Habermas is the most
prominent living exponent of a universalistic and theorising tradition
derived from Socrates and Plato, proceeding \]over Kant. In power terms,
we are speaking of 'strategic' versus 'constitution' thinking, about
struggle versus control, conflict versus consensus.

### 2AC -- Util

#### Preventing extinction is the most ethical outcome 

**Bostrom 13** (Nick, Professor at Oxford University, Faculty of
Philosophy & Oxford Martin School, Director, Future of Humanity
Institute, Director, Oxford Martin Programme on the Impacts of Future
Technology University of Oxford, "Existential Risk Prevention as Global
Priority", Global Policy Volume 4, Issue 1, February 2013 // AKONG)

[[Some other ethical perspectives We have thus far considered
existential risk from the perspective of
utilitarianism]{.underline}]{.mark} (combined with several simplify- ing
assumptions). We may briefly consider how the issue might appear when
viewed through the lenses of some other ethical outlooks. For example,
the philosopher Robert Adams outlines a different view on these matters:
I believe [a [better basis for ethical theory in this area can be found
in quite a different directio]{.mark}n---in [a commitment to the future
of human- ity as a vast projec]{.mark}t, or network of overlapping
projects, that is generally shared by the human race. The aspiration for
a better society---more just, more rewarding, and more peaceful---is a
part of this project. So are the potentially end- less quests for
scientific knowledge and philo- sophical understanding, and the
development of artistic and other cultural traditions.]{.underline} This
includes the particular cultural traditions to which we belong, in all
their accidental historic and ethnic diversity. [[It also includes our
interest in the lives of our children and grandchildren, and the hope
that they will be able, in turn, to have the lives of their children and
grandchil- dren as projects.]{.underline}]{.mark} To the extent that a
policy or practice seems likely to be favorable or unfavor- able to the
carrying out of this complex of pro- jects in the nearer or further
future, we have reason to pursue or avoid it. \... Continuity is as
important to our commitment to the project of the future of humanity as
it is to our commit- ment to the projects of our own personal futures.
Just as the shape of my whole life, and its connection with my present
and past, have an interest that goes beyond that of any iso- lated
experience, so too [the shape of human history over an extended period
of the future, and its connection with the human present and past, have
an interest that goes beyond that of the (total or average) quality of
life of a popula- tion-at-a-time, considered in isolation from how it
got that way. We owe, I think, some loyalty to this project of the human
future. We also owe it a respect]{.underline} that we would owe it even
if we were not of the human race ourselves, but beings from another
planet who had some understanding of it (Adams, 1989, pp. 472--473).
[[Since an existential catastrophe would either put an end to the
project of the future of humanity]{.mark} or drasti- cally curtail its
scope for development, [we would seem to have a strong prima facie
reason to avoid it]{.mark}]{.underline}, in Adams' view. We also note
that [an existential catastrophe would entail the frustration of many
strong preferences, sug- gesting that from a preference-satisfactionist
perspective it would be a bad thing. In a similar vein, an ethical view
emphasising that public policy should be determined through informed
democratic deliberation by all stake- holders would favour
existential-risk mitigation]{.underline} if we suppose, as is plausible,
that a majority of the world's population would come to favour such
policies upon reasonable deliberation (even if hypothetical future peo-
ple are not included as stakeholders). [[We might also have custodial
duties to preserve the inheritance of humanity passed on to us by our
ancestors and convey it safely to our descendants]{.mark}.23 We do not
want to be the failing link in the chain of generations, and we ought
not to delete or abandon the great epic of human civili- sation that
humankind has been working on for thou- sands of years]{.underline},
when it is clear that the narrative is far from having reached a natural
terminus. Further, many theological perspectives deplore naturalistic
existential catastrophes, especially ones induced by human activi- ties:
If God created the world and the human species, one would imagine that
He might be displeased if we took it upon ourselves to smash His
masterpiece (or if, through our negligence or hubris, we allowed it to
come to irreparable harm).24 We might also consider the issue from a
less theoreti- cal standpoint and try to form an evaluation instead by
considering analogous cases about which we have defi- nite moral
intuitions. Thus, for example, [[if we feel confident that committing a
**small genocide is wrong**, and that committing a large genocide is no
less wrong, we might conjecture that **committing omnicide is also
wrong**]{.mark}**.**25 And if we believe we have some moral reason to
prevent natural catastrophes that would kill a small number of people,
and a stronger moral reason to pre- vent natural catastrophes that would
kill a larger number of people, [we might conjecture that we have an
**even stronger moral reason** to prevent catastrophes that would kill
the entire human population.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Too Totalizing

#### Settler Colonialism is too broad of a theory -- prefer specificity of each scenario

**Greenstein 16** \[Ran, associate professor of sociology at the
University of the Witwatersrand, "Settler Colonialism: A Useful Category
of Historical Analysis?", Jadaliyya, June 6, 2016,
<http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/24603/settler-colonialism_a-useful-category-of-historica>,
July 10, 2017\]

Increasingly in the last decade, [settler colonialism has gained
currency as a new field of study]{.underline}. As a descriptive and
political term, its utility seems obvious. [It identifies a cluster of
countries in which colonial rule was combined historically with the
large-scale immigration of European settlers.]{.underline} It allows us
to focus on particularly resilient forms of domination that serve the
interests and concerns of settler populations that made a new home for
themselves in overseas territories. [Almost invariably facing resistance
from indigenous people, settler colonial societies were shaped by
ongoing political conflict.]{.underline} This provided them with common
features and a sense of shared destiny, understandable given the similar
challenges they face. Solidarity among those at the losing end --
indigenous people, the enslaved, and others marginalized through this
model of colonial rule -- is the counter-part of the process. At the
same time, [the extent to which the term serves a useful purpose in
historical and theoretical analysis is less obvious.]{.underline} I
argue [here that its utility in these respects is limited and it may be
misleading at times.]{.underline} For this reason, we might be better
off with other, more precise, concepts and models. I draw on examples
from Israel/Palestine and South Africa to illustrate the point. **[[What
is the problem with settler colonialism as a historical
concep]{.mark}t]{.underline}**? In a sense[, [its strongest point is
also its weakest]{.mark}]{.underline}: it is applicable to many cases
that exhibit a great diversity of conditions. [It has been applied to
countries that saw settlers overwhelm the indigenous population to such
a degree that it became demographically and economically
marginal.]{.underline} For example, [indigenous people are no more than
three percent of the population in the USA, Canada and
Australia]{.underline}. In other countries, such as Kenya, Rhodesia,
Algeria, Mozambique and South Africa, indigenous people remained the
bulk of the population, as well as the main source of labor. Slavery
featured prominently in some cases (USA, early colonial South Africa)
but not in others. Settlers of European origins retained strong legal
and political links to the mother country in Algeria, Kenya, Rhodesia,
and Portuguese African colonies. They became independent in the USA,
South Africa and other British offshoots, at times as a result of a
violent intra-colonial conflict. [In some places most settlers left the
territory after independence from colonial rule]{.underline} -- as in
Algeria, Mozambique, Angola, and Rhodesia. [Large numbers stayed put in
other countries, such as Namibia and South Africa. And, of course, where
they became numerically dominant, settlers used their political
independence to consolidate their rule, marginalizing "natives"
further.]{.underline} But [they also incorporated them into the new
polity when the demographic ratio was sufficiently favorable so as not
to pose a threat to settler domination.]{.underline} This contrasts with
the maintenance of legal-racial divisions in places where indigenous
people remained a majority of the population. [Indigenous strategies
have differed as well.]{.underline} They have consisted of attempts to
integrate as individuals on an equal basis in some countries. In others,
indigenous people sought to maintain pre-colonial identities and modes
of organization. Still others have formed nationalist movements on the
new ground created by colonial settlement, or focused on race as a basis
for resistance[. Most of these strategies acknowledge, to varying
degrees, settlers as legitimate members of the envisaged future
liberated society. It is not only the broad contours of history that
vary greatly in settler colonial societies but also patterns of social
change over time.]{.underline} Constant geographical expansion while
driving out indigenous people has occurred in the USA and Australia.
Elsewhere there has been constant expansion while incorporating
indigenous people as labor power, in South Africa most notably. In other
cases there has been an initial takeover of the entire territory with
more-or-less fixed relations of subordination throughout the period --
for example in Algeria, Kenya, Rhodesia, and Namibia. There have been
different degrees of incorporation of "urban natives" in a relatively
privileged position compared to rural populations, and different
combinations of direct and indirect despotism, to use Mahmood Mamdani's
notions of colonial rule in late colonial Africa. In other words, [the
category of settler colonialism is compatible with different demographic
ratios and different trajectories of indigenous-settler
relations]{.underline}. It can go along with different relations between
settlers and metropolitan centers and different destinies of settlers in
the post-colonial period. It is compatible with different social
structures, relying variously on free white labor, and indentured
immigrant labor, from Europe, India or other places. Or it can rely on
African slavery, indigenous labor subordination, and combinations of the
above. In all these respects, settler colonial societies do not share a
single historical dynamic nor do they exhibit a tendency to move in
similar directions. They may end up with the consolidation of settler
rule or its demise through indigenous resistance and victory. [[None of
the possible]{.mark} [outcomes serves to mark the historical trajectory
of settler colonialism]{.mark} apart from other types of colonial
societies. In the absence of a unique trajectory, does settler
colonialism display perhaps specific conceptual feature]{.underline}s?
That is to say, does it work as a theoretical model? A model offers a
relationship between a limited number of concepts or variables. It aims
to make sense of large number of observations. It reduces the infinite
variety of empirical reality into discrete units with distinct dynamics
or laws of motion. [Do models of colonial societies]{.underline}
(settler, exploitation, plantation, and so on), [show us how some cases
differ from others in theoretical terms]{.underline}? Do they outline
distinct ways in which concepts such as class, race, ethnicity,
identity, state, gender, power, sexuality, ideology, space, time, and
discourse, manifest themselves concretely or intersect with one another?
If we pose the question in this way, the conclusion seems unavoidable.
[**[Settler colonialism as a category of historical analysis does not
establish any specific social-theoretical dynamics]{.mark} unique to it.
[We cannot use its historical features to distinguish it
analytically]{.mark} -- not just descriptively -- [from other types of
societies, be they colonial or not.]{.mark}** If settler colonialism has
no specific historical or theoretical dynamics then, how do we deal
analytically with societies that fall within its
definition]{.underline}? As an alternative method of investigation, I
suggest a strategy of addressing the multiplicity of colonial and
post-colonial societies with a three-track approach: · Studying them in
their full historical specificity without imposing artificial boundaries
between classes of cases; · Deploying general analytical concepts
instead of developing idiosyncratic models. Such models abound:
"colonialism of a special type," "ethnic democracy combined with
protracted military occupation," "exclusionary colonialism," or "regimes
of separation." They may serve as useful political labels but are
theoretically without predictive value. · Engaging in selected
comparisons in order to highlight general and unique features by
examining them against each other. This should allow us to enhance the
complexity of good empirical description as well as the generality of
social theory. But it would not compromise either one of these
imperatives. To illustrate this approach, I apply it to two
settler-colonial societies, Israel/Palestine and South Africa. In what
ways does such a study offer a better prospect for historical analysis?
Is the concept of apartheid, originating in one of them and increasingly
applied to the other, a useful analytical substitute? In brief, these
two have in common an ongoing conflict between indigenous people and
settlers. It has stretched over centuries and involved conquest of
territory, massive land dispossession, and a constant quest for
innovative modes of political domination well beyond the period of
global colonial expansion and subsequent decolonization. This continued
all the way to the last decade of the twentieth century, in South
Africa, and into the twenty-first in Israel/Palestine. At the same time,
there are important differences between them. They include the
centrality of indigenous labor in enhancing settler prosperity, the
religious symbolism of the land, the prevailing mode of collective
organization (nationalism as opposed to race), and the degree of
international legitimacy. These differences shape both power and
resistance, the nature of the state and society, as well as the
possibilities of indigenous social and political mobilization. [Neither
settler colonialism nor apartheid as analytical concepts can help
us]{.underline} predict the trajectories of these societies. For that,
**[[we have to study them in concrete historical detail and outline the
precise configurations of forces at work in each
case]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The approach proposed here though, directs
our attention to key historical processes seen from a comparative angle.
For example, [[it can point out the impact of indigenous modes of
political organization on conquest and resistance]{.mark}.]{.underline}
It can also highlight the greater capacity of pre-1948 Palestinians to
shape the terms of the evolving conflict. And, it can point out the more
fragile modes of social organization of indigenous people in South
Africa. These, in turn, facilitated their conquest and incorporation
into settler-dominated economic structures. It raises questions about
the ways in which parties to the conflict in Israel/Palestine made use
of their links to global Arab, Islamic and Jewish identities and
resources. In contrast, actors in South Africa were reliant for long
periods -- before the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth
century -- on local affiliations and resources. In a contemporary vein,
[this approach leads us to examine strategies of resistance by focusing
on the centrality of the labor movement in South African struggles as
compared to its marginal role in Israel/Palestine.]{.underline} This can
be linked to patterns of settlement and conquest as well as to
affiliations with extra-territorial populations -- creating jobs for
Jewish immigrants as a crucial imperative, for example. The implications
of this difference for mobilization and change are important as well --
indigenous race/class synergy in South Africa compared to a split
between these factors in Israel/Palestine. Additionally, we could look
at culture and discourse. [We could discuss the prevalence of
demographic considerations in the one case, and its relative absence in
the other. The concern of Jewish settlers with becoming a majority had
to do with the prior historical consolidation of ethno-national
identities in Israel/Palestine.]{.underline} It was also linked to the
absence of the technological advantage that was central to relations of
domination between settlers and indigenous people in South Africa,
making a settler majority less of an imperative there. This, in turn,
affected political strategies of demographic exclusion, leading to
ethnic cleansing in Israel/Palestine. It contrasts with the
incorporation/exploitation of indigenous people as providers of labor
power and, later on, as citizens, in South Africa.

### 2AC -- Essentialism

#### The K creates a false dichotomy between the indigenous and colonizer -- that's the worst form of essentialism

**Andersen 9** \[Chris, Associate Professor of Native Studies at
Alberta, "critical indigenous studies From Difference to Density",
Cultural Studies Review, Vol. 15 No 2 2009, pg. 80-100\]

Champagne's abstraction, [imprecision and internal contradictions make
it difficult to produce definitive conclusions about his
work.]{.underline} However, [Indigeneity-as-different constitutes a
major staple of his argument and even a sympathetic reading requires
some agility to avoid the essentialism which grounds it.]{.underline} My
point is this: Champagne's argument that the '[continued emphasis on how
race and ethnic identity in mainstream institutions tends to overshadow
the less well understood perspectives of an Indigenous paradigm grounded
in the cultures, sovereignty, identities, land, and nation building of
indigenous peoples'42 loses its relevance if it fails to include a
precise explanation of what the latter terms mean and how they differ
from 'race' and 'ethnic identity'.]{.underline} His repeated failure to
delineate them [leaves little analytical purchase to deal with the
complexities of being Indigenous in modern, Western societies, either
with respect to how we identify ourselves, how we critique dominant,
whitestream representations or how we employ Western discursive
authorities in our daily struggles.]{.underline} For example, Champagne
proposes that '\[i\]mproving existing theories or categorizations \[of
Western disciplines\] will involve significant revision, and it is
doubtful that existing theories can conceptualize or explain the
cultural, land, self-government, and colonial histories of Indigenous
nations';43 and further, that 'most current theories do not provide
powerful enough tools for explaining the Indigenous experience'.44 One
of many questions which arise from such statements, of course, is the
extent to which Indigenous studies---which must necessarily place itself
within the same academic relations of power that shape 'Western'
disciplines---can under any circumstances cash the kind of cheque
Champagne is writing on its behalf (more on this in part three). Of more
immediate concern: [[given that Native studies must operate within the
forms of power and associated conditions of possibility that
characterise other academic disciplines, what allows it to step
outside]{.mark} in ways the other disciplines cannot? [For Champagne, it
is]{.mark} our [valorisation of Indigenous
epistemologies.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Given the centrality of his
criticism of Western concepts, his positioning of their central terms
deserves to be quoted in their full length, precisely because they
explicate the conceptual bases from which he launches his critique of
Western disciplines:]{.underline} race: 'Race and critical race theories
focus on marginalization of socially conceived racial groups and provide
critiques of dominant group methods of oppression and control ... [the
focus of race and critical race theories tends to assume achievement of
equality and inclusion into US society as a primary goal]{.underline}.
Such goals of social equality are taken up by some American Indians, but
race and critical race theories do not conceptualize or center
collective American Indian goals such as preservation of land,
self-government, and reclaiming culture';45 class: 'while helpful, class
theory provides little conceptual or explanatory power for understanding
American Indian emphases on reclaiming culture and collective tribal
forms of economic organization';46 ethnicity: '[Theories of ethnicity
focus on group organization and culture but do not include issues such
as collective land retention and institutions of self-government';47
nation: ' "Nation" is a term often used in Indian country today partly
because the expression makes sense in English and in American culture
for a political grouping, but its meaning may have powerful cultural
meanings for many American Indian communities that are not implied in
the English expression';48 post-modernism/post-colonialism: 'are imbued
with the deep social epistemologies of Western society]{.underline}.
There is much emphasis on marginalization, generally in materialistic
forms, and on emancipation and liberation from oppression. Such
arguments make sense given the economic and colonial conditions under
which indigenous peoples often live, but the goals of the theories
should not be imputed to be the goals and values of many indigenous
peoples and communities'.49 Given the apparent inadequacy of these
concepts in Champagne's argument and his stated focus on Indigenous
communities and nations, what is he left with in his pursuit of an
academic basis for Indigenous studies? [[His]{.mark} looming but largely
unacknowledged [essentialism leaves him]{.mark}---as essentialism
usually does---[with an emphasis on Indigenous
difference]{.mark}.]{.underline} Champagne repeatedly stresses elements
which supposedly render Indigenous communities and cultures different
from settler society and its communities: for example, our collective
forms of governance, collective land retention and institutions of self
government, the centrality of non-human powers and the importance of
balance between human and nonhuman powers, all sit outside the ability
of Western disciplines to analyse.50 Thus, [the epistemological (and,
one assumes, ontological) commitment of concepts of race, class,
ethnicity, nation and culture to Western society---to assimilation or
renationalisation---precludes the 'deep cultural or institutional
perspective of American Indians or center American Indian history or
individual, group, or cultural experiences'.]{.underline}51 They fail,
for example, to 'emphasize ways of life that seek spiritual or moral
balance with the human and nonhuman forces of the world'.52 Perhaps
equally importantly, (Champagne's) American Indian communities are, he
tells us, likely to find such concepts troubling insofar as they rely on
'epistemological assumptions usually alien to those made in American
Indian communities and traditions'.53 Few Native studies practitioners
would quarrel with Champagne's argument that Indigenous communities
differ in fundamental ways from dominant, whitestream society. This
acknowledgement, however, is accompanied by two rubs. First, [in the
specific context of the academy, in [his failure to explain specifically
why Indigenous studies as a discipline should hold a privileged
place]{.mark} in the academy to render pronouncements regarding the
authenticity of this difference. Second and relatedly, [Champagne
unproblematically conflates community Indigeneity with its academic
manifestation and]{.mark} in doing so [reproduces the very same
epistemological power of whiteness]{.mark}]{.underline} (at the heart of
all academic disciplines) he critiques in his original formulation. What
epistemological distances exist between academic and community
knowledge? Where can we place Native studies in this continuum?
Champagne doesn't answer these questions because for him, the latter
question is, in an ideal world, a solution to the former: [[Native
studies is Indigenous knowledge in the academy]{.mark}. [Champagne's
failure to account for the constitutive character of power]{.mark} which
shapes 'academic Indigeneity' [pushes his argument]{.mark} unnecessarily
and uncomfortably close to [an 'Aboriginalist' logic which locates
Indigeneity]{.mark} by precisely [what]{.mark}, apparently, [it is not:
white/ capitalist/secular/modern]{.mark}.]{.underline} Certainly, his
intentions differ from those of colonial administrators who sought to
destroy our distinctiveness, disregard our complexity and produce
representations which apparently reaffirm(ed) their superiority over us.
Non[etheless, [his essentialism effectively marginalises 'dynamic,
kinetic, and unfolding \[Indigenous\] voice\[s\]]{.mark}'54 at a time
when many (including Champagne himself) have laboured so intensively to
interrogate and denaturalise such static representations.]{.underline}
Perhaps equally importantly, his analytical lens remains focused solely
in the direction of Indigenous communities and in so doing handcuffs our
ability to undertake an immanent deconstruction of Indigenous
representations produced in and by white society. [Champagne's argument
is clearly dedicated to clearing intellectual space for an Indigenous
studies willing to do the heavy lifting involved in exploring and
analysing what 'the Western gaze rarely acknowledges']{.underline} (see
below) [by using distinctive theoretical and methodological tools
apparently unavailable to Western disciplines.]{.underline} We might,
then, merely (if generously) read Champagne's argument as advocating
that a proper study of contemporary Indigeneity requires both Indigenous
and Western epistemologies. This strand of his argument, though abruptly
anti-essentialist and almost wholly at odds with his earlier discussion,
appears reasonably to suggest that Indigenous communities are not so
different after all, and certainly allows him to avoid his articles'
more essentialist moments. However, this move paints Champagne into
another, equally tricky corner. If Indigenous communities are not
essentially different, on what epistemological basis can Indigenous
studies stake a theoretical or methodological claim separate from those
of other disciplines? With all due respect to Champagne, we can no
longer base such a claim around an ability to ask questions about
Indigeneity in ways Western disciplines cannot, since that ship sailed
when he cracked open his positioning of Indigeneity to all
epistemological comers. Likewise, he has a larger problem which, perhaps
ironically, stems from this same stated centring of Indigenous
communities. Though in placing our communities front and centre he
rightfully positions us as knowledgeable, agentic subjects, his argument
narrows this knowledge to what we know about ourselves and presents no
sustained analysis of our equally important knowledge about whiteness.
This latter task requires expertise in the very 'Western' disciplinary
concepts he dismisses. In doing so, Champagne places us outside of the
regimes of power which accord these concepts their currency. In a
phrase, Champagne has valorised our difference at the expense of our
density. The third and final part of the paper will address these
issues.

### 2AC -- Futurity Good (AT: Dalley)

#### Futurity is key to challenge oppressive structures -- focus on reproductive futurism allows us to be reflexive of the past and present

**Unger 7** (Robert Mangabeira, Professor of Law Harvard, "The Self
Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound,"
<http://www.law.harvard.edu/unger/english/docs/pragmatism.doc>)

**[The third theme is [Futurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Whether or not
time is for real in the vast world of nature, of which our knowledge
always remains at once remote and contradictory, is a subject that will
always continue to arouse controversy[. **That time is for real in human
existence is not, however, a speculative thesis; it [is a pressure we
face with mounting force,]{.mark} so long as we remain conscious and not
deluded, in our passage from birth to death. [The temporal character of
our existence is]{.mark} the consequence of our embodiment, [the stigma
of our finitude,]{.mark} and the condition that gives transcendence its
point. We are not exhausted by the social and cultural worlds we inhabit
and build. They are finite. We, in comparison to them, are not. We can
see, think, feel, build, and connect in more ways than they can
allow**]{.underline}. That is why we are required to rebel against them:
to advance our interests and ideals as we now understand them, but also
to become ourselves, affirming the polarity that constitutes the
law-breaking law of our being**[[.       To seek what goes beyond the
established structure]{.mark} and [represents,]{.mark} for that very
reason, [the possible beginning of another
structure]{.mark},]{.underline}** even of a structure that organizes its
own remaking**[, is [to live for the future.]{.mark} Living for the
future [is a way of living in the present as a being not wholly
determined by the present conditions of its
existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} We never completely
surrender. We go about our business of passive submission, of voiceless
despair, as if we knew that the established order were not for keeps,
and had no final claim to our allegiance. Orientation to the future
**[\-- futurity \-- is a defining condition of
personality]{.underline}**.       So fundamental is this feature of our
existence that it also shapes the experience of thinking, even when our
thoughts are directed away from ourselves to nature. Ceaselessly
reorganizing our experience of particulars under general headings,
constantly breaking up and remaking the headings to master the
experience, intuiting in one set of known relations the existence of
another, next to it or hidden under it, finding out one thing when we
had set out to find out another, and discovering indeed what our
assumptions and methods may have ruled out as paradoxical,
contradictory, or impossible, we come to see the next steps of thought
\-- its possibilities, its future \-- as the point of the whole past of
thought. [      **[Futurity should]{.mark} cease to be a predicament and
should [become a program: we should radicalize it to empower
ourselves]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} That is the reason to take an
interest in ways of organizing thought and society that diminish the
influence of what happened before on what can happen next. Such
intellectual and institutional innovations make change in thought less
dependent on the pressure of unmastered anomalies and change in society
less dependent on the blows of unexpected trauma. In any given
historical situation, the effort to live for the future has consequences
for how we order our ideas and for how we order our societies. There is
a structure to the organized revision of structures. Its constituents,
however, are not timeless. We paste them together with the time-soaked
materials at hand.

### 2AC -- Scenario Analysis Good (AT: Dalley) 

#### Scenario analysis is pedagogically valuable -- enhances creativity and self-reflexivity, deconstructs cognitive biases and flawed ontological assumptions, and enables the imagination and creation of alternative futures.

[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[[Scenario analysis is]{.mark} thus **typically [seen as serving]{.mark}
the purposes of [corporate planning or]{.mark} as a [policy]{.mark}
tool**]{.underline} to be used in combination with simulations of
decision making. **[Yet scenario analysis [is not]{.mark} inherently
[limited to these uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This
section]{.underline} provides a brief overview of the practice of
scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses. It then
[makes a case for the utility of the technique for political science
scholarship]{.underline} and describes how the scenarios deployed at
NEFPC were created. The Art of Scenario Analysis [[We characterize
scenario analysis as]{.mark} the art of [juxtaposing]{.mark} current
[trends in]{.mark} unexpected [combinations]{.mark} in order [to
**articulate** ]{.mark}**surprising and yet [plausible
futures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, often **[referred to as "alternative
worlds."]{.underline}** [[Scenarios are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
**[explicitly [not forecasts]{.mark} or projections [based on linear
extrapolations]{.mark} of contemporary patterns]{.underline}**, [and
they are **not hypothesis-based expert predictions**]{.underline}.
[**[Nor should they be equated with simulations]{.mark}**, [which
are]{.mark}]{.underline} best characterized as [functional
[representations of **real** ]{.mark}**institutions** or
[decision-making processes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[Instead,
[they are]{.mark} depictions of [possible future states of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, offered **[together [with]{.mark} a
narrative of the driving [causal forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
potential exogenous shocks **[[that could lead to those
futures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Good scenarios thus rely on explicit
causal propositions that, independent of one another, are
plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way. While
scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic planning
during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary practice
are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s
(Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at
Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the usual
forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector. Building on
its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013). [Several features make
scenario analysis particularly useful for policymaking]{.underline}.5
[Long-term global trends across a number of different
realms]{.underline}---social, technological, environmental, economic,
and political---[combine in often-unexpected ways to produce unforeseen
challenges]{.underline}. [Yet [the ability of decision makers to
imagine,]{.mark} let alone prepare for,
[discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} in the policy realm [[is
constrained by]{.mark} their [existing mental models]{.mark} and
maps]{.underline}. [This limitation is [exacerbated by]{.mark}
**well-known [cognitive bias]{.mark} tendencies [such as groupthink and
confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jervis 1976; Janis 1982;
Tetlock 2005). [The [power of scenarios lies in]{.mark} their [ability
to help individuals **break out of conventional** ]{.mark}**modes of
[thinking]{.mark}** and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of
trends and deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the
future]{.underline}. **[Imagining [alternative future worlds through a
structured analytical process enables policymakers to envision
and]{.mark} thereby [adapt to something]{.mark} altogether [different
from the known present]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Designing Scenarios for
Political Science Inquiry The characteristics of scenario analysis that
commend its use to policymakers also make it well suited to helping
political scientists generate and develop policy-relevant research
programs. [Scenarios are essentially textured, plausible, and relevant
stories that help us imagine how the future]{.underline}
political-economic world [could be different from the past]{.underline}
in a manner that highlights policy challenges and opportunities. For
example, terrorist organizations are a known threat that have captured
the attention of the policy community, yet our responses to them tend to
be linear and reactive. Scenarios that explore how seemingly unrelated
vectors of change---the rise of a new peer competitor in the East that
diverts strategic attention, volatile commodity prices that empower and
disempower various state and nonstate actors in surprising ways, and the
destabilizing effects of climate change or infectious disease
pandemics---can be useful for illuminating the nature and limits of the
terrorist threat in ways that may be missed by a narrower focus on
recognized states and groups. By illuminating the potential strategic
significance of specific and yet poorly understood opportunities and
threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial gaps in our
collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends and
dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social science
scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality itself. [Very
simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief often-overlooked
yet pressing questions in international affairs that demand focused
investigation]{.underline}. [Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in
principle, [an innovative tool for developing a political science
research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, [achieving this objective
requires careful tailoring of the approach]{.underline}. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario
discussions themselves, as described below, lay bare these especially
implausible claims and systematic biases.8 An explicit methodological
approach underlies the written scenarios themselves as well as the
analytical process around them---that of case-centered, structured,
focused comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal
mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use of scenarios is similar
to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies certain variables in a
given situation in order to analyze the resulting effects]{.underline}
(Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are traditionally
retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events that did not
actually occur in the context of known history, our **[scenarios are
deliberately forward-looking]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} are
[designed to **explore potential futures**]{.underline} that could
unfold. As such, counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to
identifying how individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of
choices" available to political actors and thus lead to different
historical outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while forward-looking scenario
analysis can better illuminate surprising intersections and
sociopolitical dynamics without the perceptual constraints imposed by
fine-grained historical knowledge. [We see scenarios as a complementary
resource for exploring these dynamics in international affairs, rather
than as a replacement]{.underline} for counterfactual analysis,
historical case studies, or other methodological tools. In the scenario
process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios are employed,
acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario, as detailed
below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which represent
hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving
international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself employs
templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas. [The
scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance. [The scenario
approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the belief that
these traditional approaches can be complemented by identifying
questions likely to be of great empirical importance in the real world,
even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles [**in existing
research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [scenarios]{.underline} analyzed at NEFPC
[envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium (five to
seven year) term and are designed to **tease out issues scholars and
policymakers may encounter in the relatively near future**]{.underline}
[so that they can **begin thinking critically about them
now**]{.underline}. [This timeframe offers a period distant enough from
the present as to avoid falling into current events analysis, but not so
far into the future as to seem like science fiction]{.underline}. In
imagining the worlds in which these scenarios might come to pass,
[participants **learn strategies for avoiding failures of creativity**
and for **overturning the assumptions that prevent scholars and analysts
from anticipating and understanding** the pivotal junctures that arise
in international affairs]{.underline}.

Apprehending this history as what Jodi Byrd has called the "transit"
over which the international "postwestern" cityscape of Las Vegas is
realized leads us into a reading of a very different type of frontier
than the one memorialized on Fremont Street (Transit xv). Read this way,
as a site of Indigenous dispossession, [the West cannot be seen as a
dynamic site of **pure** possibility]{.underline}, as Gilles Deleuze and
Félix Guattari have represented it, [as "a rhizomatic West]{.underline},
with its Indians without ancestry, its ever- receding limit, its
shifting and displaced frontiers" (19). [The [repetitive]{.mark}
[revisitation of frontier tropes recalls what]{.mark}]{.underline}
critic Hamish [**[Dalley]{.underline}** [calls "the]{.underline}
**[frozen temporality]{.underline}** [of settler- colonial
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}," which, "fixated on the moment of the
frontier, recalls nothing so much as Freud's description of the
'repetition compulsion' attending trauma" (Dalley). The "hyperreal West"
in this context emerges as a fantasy (Lewis 194), in the sense that

"westness.]{.underline}" As the postwestern critics argue, "westness" is
neither contained by geography (as the popularity of the Western genre
internationally attests), nor necessarily representative of cultural
production being produced within the western United States (Kollin x--
xi). When we speak of a cultural production as "Western," we are
speaking of a work that addresses the process and consequences of
settler conquest, whether we are discussing a California memoir, an
Australian novel, or an Italian fi lm.7 [This is [not to say]{.mark}
that [Western cultural production is **always a result of settler
colonial ideology,**]{.mark}]{.underline} [but rather that it is engaged
with questions **pertaining** to it]{.underline}. Th e problem of the
West is, in a crucial sense, the problem of settler colonialism.
[[Imagining postwestern futures]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[requires]{.mark} a [critical outlook]{.mark} that is **[more than just
inclusive in]{.mark} its [politics]{.mark}**, transnational in its
scope, and poststructuralist in its methodology. [Our movement]{.mark}
toward the "post" in the conceptual space of the Western [must be
**decolonial**]{.mark} **in its orientation**]{.underline}. Such a
critique would abandon unilateral settler attempts at postnational
place-making in order [[to critique]{.mark} settler colonial
[structures]{.mark} of violence]{.underline}. Such a critique
[[would]{.underline} **[not work to reify these]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**structures [as permanent or inevitable]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark} rather
to **[probe their contradictions]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} to
[promote]{.underline} the **[Indigenous intellectual
traditions]{.underline}** that have long been at work [critiquing the
settler colonial present in order to shape a decolonial
future]{.underline}.8 We hope that this special issue of Western
American Literature, which features critical readings of western
American film and literature by three scholars from different fields and
national backgrounds, can contribute toward this effort.

[[There remains]{.mark}, Of course, [the question Of whether any
knowledge]{.mark} Of theory [is pure]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether
Young\'s deconstructive moves are in the end any less appropriative Of
their objects of knowledge (Marxism, colonial discourse analysis) than
the theories he criticises. **[[Part of the problem lies in the
assumption that theoretical \'purity\' is
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [part of the problem lies in the
assumption that \'purity\', even if possible, is politically
desirable.]{.underline} For Adorno and Horkheimer, for instance, [these
assumptions would be a major shortcoming in the operations of
post-structuralism and some post-colonial theory.]{.underline} Such
operations repeat the very way in which traditional philosophy
(Enlightenment \'or otherwise) cuts itself off from a self-reflective
consideration of its relationship to material and political power,
deluding itself as to its pure and autonomous status, and thereby
becomes all the more readily an instrument and mirror Of social
domination. As Adorno States elsewhere, \[ellipses in orig\] ...[[the
idea of the mastery of pure reason as a being-in-itself]{.mark},
separate from practice, [subjects even the subject and turns it into an
instrument toward purposes.]{.mark} A form of self-reflection of reason
really of help would make Its transition to praxis: [this
self-reflection would see through itself to its practical moment;
instead Of mistaking itself for the absolute]{.mark}, it would know that
it is a kind of conduct.]{.underline} The anti-mythological aspect of
progress cannot be thought without the practical act which seizes the
delusion of the autarchy of spirit by the reins. [Thus, [progress is
also not ascertainable through disinterested
consideration]{.mark}.]{.underline} 16 [Adorno\'s comments arise from a
complex meditation on the nature and theory of (social, historical and
intellectual) \'progress\' , a concept which occupies an embattled
position within and across a range Of post-colonial and development
theories]{.underline}. He argues (among other things) that **[[progress
means humanity emerges from its spellbound state no longer under the
spell of progress as wel]{.mark}l, itself nature, [by becoming aware of
its own indigenousness to nature and by halting the mastery over nature
through which nature continues its mastery]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
this respect it could be said that progress only comes about at the
point when it come to an end. 17 In this conclusion, [a notion of
progress proves to be as indispensable as it is dangerous to human
emancipation.]{.underline} The complex turns of Adorno\'s dialectic, in
which Enlightenment traditions of identity-thinking are subjected to an
immanent critique, suggest ways in which dialectical thinking can be a
tool in challenging, not upholding, philosophical trends towards a
totalising absolutism, founded on a notion of the fundamentally
unstable, contradictory, interdependent, and mutually transformative
relations between \'subject\' and \*object\', \'self and \'other\'.
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\'s critique of theoretical spur.ty\' overlaps
in many ways with that of Adorno. Spivak would suggest that even those
who do not go in for strategic essentiallism do not thereby remain pure:
[[You pick up the universal that will give you the power to fight
against the other side, and What you are throwing away is your
theoretical purity]{.mark}. Whereas the great custodians of the
anti-universal are obliged therefore simply to act in the interest of a
great narrative, the narrative]{.underline} Of exploitation, While they
keep themselves Clean by not committing themselves to anything. In fact
they are actually run by a great narrative even as they are busy
protecting their theoretical purity by repudiating
