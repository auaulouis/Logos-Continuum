#### UQ/Link -- US-Saudi arms sales increasing now, sales critical to the US defense industry and economy 

**Knights, 2018**

(Michael - senior fellow @ The Washington Institute, visited Yemen and
the Gulf coalition states four times in 2018 to observe military
operations, "U.S.-Saudi Security Cooperation (Part 1): Conditioning Arms
Sales to Build Leverage," The Washington Institute,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/u.s.-saudi-security-cooperation-part-1-conditioning-arms-sales-to-build-lev>)

[The U.S.-Saudi strategic relationship is built on]{.underline} a simple
premise: Washington provides physical security for the Saudi state,
while Riyadh serves as a cooperative counterterrorism partner and an
apolitical, responsive supplier to global energy markets. **[Arms
sales]{.underline}** are integral to this relationship: [the task of
maintaining the large Saudi military binds Washington and Riyadh
together, while the kingdom's massive purchases of U.S.]{.underline}
armaments and related services [strengthen the American defense industry
and general **economy.**]{.underline} Traditionally, the relationship
was also based on the expectation that the United States would take the
lead on foreign and security policies to protect Saudi Arabia. Under the
Obama administration, however, this formula was replaced by a
partner-based approach that encouraged the kingdom to develop more
forces capable of providing security on their own. Riyadh subsequently
begun to take unforeseen unilateral action on its self-perceived
security interests, leading to crises such as the brutal war in Yemen,
the isolation of Qatar, the abduction of Lebanese prime minister Saad
al-Hariri, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. These
developments have heightened the sentiment within Congress that U.S.
security cooperation with Saudi Arabia should be reviewed---an attitude
that will likely grow stronger after the November 6 midterm elections.
The push for such scrutiny will become particularly urgent if the
parties involved in the Yemen war fail to establish the lasting
ceasefire called for by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis last week. APPRAISING AMERICA'S BIGGEST ARMS
CUSTOMER Since May 2017, President Trump has repeatedly stated that the
[Saudis intend to buy \$110 billion worth of weapons]{.underline} and
associated services [from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
a figure that appears to include both currently active sales and
memoranda of intent for future sales. Whatever the exact figure
ultimately proves to be, [the scope of Riyadh's planned purchases
is]{.underline} undoubtedly **[gargantuan.]{.underline}** In the past
ten years, [the kingdom has committed to buy more arms]{.underline},
parts, and associated training and maintenance services **[than any
other foreign customer,]{.underline}** [with Congress receiving
notification of \$138.9 billion in potential sales]{.underline}: \$90.09
billion during the eight-year Obama administration and \$48.81 billion
in two years under President Trump. Among the purchases reported by
Congressional Research Service were: \$63 billion on fixed-wing aircraft
systems, including combat and non-combat aircraft, munitions, and
electronic upgrades \$49.2 billion on land warfare systems, including
armored vehicles, artillery, and munitions \$49.1 billion on helicopter
systems, including Apache gunships and utility transports \$24.3 billion
on missile defense, including Patriot missiles and a proposed \$15
billion worth of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems
\$12 billion on naval systems, including a proposed \$11.5 billion worth
of littoral combat ship variants. LAND WARFARE PURCHASES AND THE YEMEN
WAR Saudi Arabia's heavy investment in land warfare systems,
helicopters, and airpower over the past decade is no coincidence. It
began when Houthi rebels inflicted a series of shocking defeats on the
kingdom's border forces in 2009-2010. Since then, the United States has
built up the offensive capabilities of the Saudi Arabian National Guard
and Royal Saudi Land Forces, the elements that spearheaded the kingdom's
ground campaigns in Yemen once the current war broke out in 2015. These
purchases included: Immediate refit after 2010. Initial Saudi
investments in 2010-2013 focused on remedying shortfalls witnessed while
fighting the Houthis, notably the need for up-armored, mine-resistant
troop carriers and armored attack helicopters capable of dishing
out---and taking---heavy punishment. Riyadh also purchased air-to-ground
weapons, sensors, and training packages with the aim of getting the
Royal Saudi Air Force ready to support new ground operations in Yemen.
Resupply during the current war. In addition to clearly defensive
systems (e.g., border surveillance aerostats, counter-battery radars),
the Saudi military sought U.S. resupply of its land forces as they
shifted from defending the border to pushing into Houthi-held parts of
northern Yemen. A proposed sale of 115 M1A2S main battle tanks and
support vehicles failed to obtain congressional approval in September
2016 but is moving forward under the Trump administration. In
March-April 2018, Congress was notified of proposed sales involving
\$2.28 billion worth of munitions and 155 millimeter self-propelled
armored artillery systems for the land forces. Although tank and
artillery systems can be used defensively, they should probably be
viewed as offensive systems given Saudi Arabia's increase in short-range
campaigns extending ten to fifteen miles inside northern Yemen.
PRECISION-GUIDED MUNITIONS Sales of air-delivered precision-guided
munitions (PGMs) are another lightning rod issue in the bilateral
security relationship. Following the 2009-2010 round of hostilities with
the Houthis, the kingdom sought to refresh its stock of antipersonnel
bombs with a large order of 1,300 U.S.-built CBU-105 sensor-fused
weapons (a higher-reliability submunition that manufacturers say does
not qualify as a cluster bomb due to its low malfunction rate). Yet by
November 2015, eight months into the current war, the Saudis had used up
nearly 2,600 PGMs, according to strike metrics compiled by The
Washington Institute. In response, the Saudis requested a \$1.29 billion
package comprising around 19,000 air-delivered PGMs, an order that began
delivery in July 2017. In addition to that package, the Senate narrowly
approved a new \$500 million commercial sale of PGMs to Riyadh in June
2017---the first installment in a mammoth \$4.46 billion series of
air-launched munition deals that would provide the Saudis with 104,000
U.S. PGMs in the next half decade. [Riyadh may be accelerating its
purchases in anticipation of a prolonged war in Yemen]{.underline} and
the potential loss of U.S. sales down the road. According to Washington
Institute data collected in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the kingdom's forces
have used around 14,500 munitions since March 2015, almost all PGMs,
with the average rate gradually declining from 333 PGMs per month in
2015 to 270 per month this year. The U.S. munitions currently arriving
in Saudi Arabia were ordered in November 2015, when Riyadh recognized it
might need new PGMs by 2019, but the intervening years have seen few
signs of a PGM shortfall. [Based on]{.underline} a rough sense of
[prewar stocks and]{.underline} a constant dribble of [replacements,
Riyadh could probably keep bombing at its current rate for several years
even if all new U.S. PGM deals were rejected.]{.underline} Thus, while
[cutting off such sales]{.underline} may be a good way to signal U.S.
displeasure or publicly distance Washington from the war, the data
indicates that it [would not meaningfully slow the air
campaign]{.underline} anytime soon. ADJUSTING U.S. SALES With
U.S.-provided bombs used in many of the war's deadliest civilian
fatality incidents, [Congress has]{.underline} ample [rationale to
block]{.underline}, delay, or condition [future arms sales]{.underline}
to Saudi Arabia. [Depending on]{.underline} the results of this week's
election, the Senate's cross-party, forty-seven-seat opposition to such
sales could become a majority. Saudi intransigence on the Khashoggi case
or Yemen peace talks could also flip more senators into supporting a
joint resolution against new weapons packages. In all likelihood, the
president would veto any such resolution unless Congress can show that
it has carefully weighed the [costs---in terms of both neglecting the
legitimate security needs of a long-term partner and harming America's
status as a security ally and arms vendor]{.underline}.

#### The plan will cause customers to ditch American defense firms -- perceptions of slowing sales triggers backlash

Indeed, by invoking the emergency exception, the White House may have
opened a Pandora's box of foreign and economic policy specters that
reach beyond the current Gulf arms deals and Iran threats. With the
precedent set, Saudi Arabia and the UAE may now expect such expeditious
treatment for all defense sales given their place on the frontline
against Iran. Meanwhile, Congress will likely retaliate against the
executive branch's circumvention of the standard review process by
slowing down the approval of future arms sales to these two governments,
further deteriorating their already frayed relations with Washington.
Other countries may seek preferential treatment as well, citing non-Iran
emergencies such as threats from Russia or China[. At a time when many
foreign officials already view the United States as unreliable, further
perceptions of unequal treatment among partners is unlikely to
help]{.underline}. Finally, **[the situation could have unexpected
implications for the defense industry]{.underline}**. [On the surface,
U.S. defense firms have much to gain from the administration's \$8.1
billion in expedited sales]{.underline}. Yet **[if Congress decides to
constrain sales to certain countries]{.underline}** or boost its
oversight in the long term, **[more global customers may decide that the
costs of doing business with American firms outweigh the
benefits]{.underline}**. [Many buyers are already dismayed by the
procedures and pace of U.S. arms sales and are increasingly looking to
foreign competitors]{.underline}, particularly Russia and China. [A more
pronounced shift in that direction would directly affect the U.S.
economy and undermine a key tool in Washington's effort to remain the
security partner of choice in the Middle East.]{.underline}

TRUMP'S ARMS EXPORTS POLICY: DEBUNKING KEY ASSUMPTIONS SHIMON ARAD
SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 (Shimon Arad is a retired colonel of the Israeli
Defense Forces. His writings focus on Middle East regional security
topics.)
https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trumps-arms-exports-policy-debunking-key-assumptions/

[The United States dominates the growing global arms market]{.underline}
and according to data gathered by the authoritative Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), its lead is expanding.
The United States accounted for 34 percent of total arms exports between
2013 and 2017, ranking it significantly higher than its main competitors
Russia (22 percent), France (6.7 percent), Germany (5.8 percent), China
(5.7 percent), and Britain (4.8 percent). In FY 2018, the value of
signed arms deals continued to increase, reaching over \$46 billion,
exceeding the \$41 billion figure of FY 2017. Undergirding this policy
is Trump's vision that economic security is national security. **[The
defense and aerospace industry is America's second-largest gross
exporter]{.underline}**. [The industry contributes approximately \$1
trillion annually to the U.S. economy and employs around 2,500,000
people. On average, **30 percent of the industry's annual revenue is
through arms exports**]{.underline}, [which reduces the need for
domestic investment, reduces the cost-per-unit for the U.S. military,
and enables an increase of investments in innovation, thereby retaining
America's technological lead.]{.underline} However, a **[number of
trends combine to make Washington nervous about its lead in global arms
sales]{.underline}**. [The first is a growing effort by other
technologically innovative arms exporters to compete with the United
States for markets. Arms sales by Britain, France, Spain, China, and
Russia have reduced America's potential share of the important markets
of the Middle East]{.underline} (49 percent of the U.S. arms exports
between 2013 and 2017) [and Asia.]{.underline} To a certain extent, the
people behind the new CAT policy believe that the strict and rigid
regulatory and procedural frameworks that governed the arms exports
processes have undermined the U.S. competitiveness in the global arms
market and the implementation of the new policy is anticipated to
increase sales. [A second trend is the deliberate policy of client
states to diversify]{.underline} their arms purchases. [The Arab Sunni
states]{.underline}, for example[, have]{.underline} in the last couple
of years [spent tens of billions of dollars on European or Russian arms
rather than on U.S.-made weapon systems]{.underline}. Even a country
like Egypt, which has received nearly \$80 billion in military and
economic aid over the past 30 years, has tapped from its reserves and
loans from Gulf states and from suppliers in order to purchase at least
\$13 billion worth of arms since 2013 from France, Russia, and Germany
rather than from the United States. The new CAT policy aims to encourage
allies and partners to buy U.S.-made arms, including by increasing
competitiveness by dropping surcharges on products and lowering the
costs of transportation. [A third trend is the growing demands of client
states for more substantial offsets]{.underline} and localization of
production and maintenance, including the transfer of technology. Thus,
for example, under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia wants to eventually
subject foreign military contracts to a 50 percent localization rule,
based on a partnership model that includes the sharing of technologies
and skills. The Middle East's growing armored vehicles market, which is
expected to reach more than \$31 billion by 2021, is an example of a
growing demand for the transfer of technical knowledge which is used to
strengthen an indigenous defense sector that has already begun to export
its own products. Some Western European countries are more forthcoming
on this issue than the United States. However, some U.S. companies have
begun forming subsidiaries abroad.

**There's [robust statistical proof]{.underline} that economic crisis
triggers diversionary war**

**Howell, 13** - B.A. from Emory University (Patrick Davis Howell,
"Economic Crises and the Initiation of Militarized Disputes," The
University of Georgia,
https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/howell_patrick_d_201305_ma.pdf)

Implications

The **[findings are clear]{.underline}**: [[economic crises are
an]{.mark} **[important trigger]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for shifts in a
state's rate of dispute initiation]{.underline}]{.mark}. [By [using
a]{.mark} **[large sample]{.mark}** of states [over]{.mark} a period of
**[185 years]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[this
conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[be]{.mark} taken as **[generalizable to the entire population of
states]{.mark}** in the international system]{.underline}. In addition
to providing support for issue crossover and the influence economic
troubles can play on foreign policy decisions, [the
findings]{.underline} here also [support the]{.underline} methodological
[rationale for using economic crises as **explicit**]{.underline},
observable [events]{.underline}, instead of as trends in other variables
(e.g. GDP growth). Of course, this is not to say that all work on this
topic is final. There exist a number of areas where this research agenda
can be improved upon and/or extended to in order to provide a more
holistic account of where and how economic crises exactly apply
political pressure on leaders.

First, the study of [[diversionary war exists in]{.mark} both
**[quantitative tests]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} in more finetoothed
examinations of **[actual cases]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Levy and Vakili
1992; Fravel 2010). Exploring the internal processes within states in
such a fashion can also produce a deeper understanding of the exact
causal mechanisms through which prospect theory operates. Aggregation
and levels of analysis become a basic concern with applying prospect
theory outside of the laboratory and to states and governments. After
all, "prospect theory is developed as a theory of individual decision
making, the question is whether it is applicable to collective decision
making" (Vis 2011, 337). Here a unitary actor assumption is made from
the outset, but it is also possible that the observed effect is driven
instead by individual decision-makers themselves (for example, Fuhrmann
and Early 2008, who keep the level of analysis only on President Bush).
A deeper case study of a few select cases with an eye towards process
might reveal whether the increase in conflict initiation is due to a
single policy entrepreneur or leader, or if it is the result of
collective behavior (as perhaps even aides, legislators, and bureaucrats
seek to compensate for the detrimental effects that accompany an
economic crisis separately or in concert).

Examination of specific cases might also provide a more accurate picture
for policymakers of the strategy that can accompany an economic crisis
and inducement of diversionary tendencies in another state. Smith (Smith
1998) hypothesizes diversionary actions as a strategic game, and finds
that potential target states should then adopt a policy of strategic
avoidance -- disengaging from any scenario that might make them a target
from a diversionary conflict initiated by an opposing state in dire
straits. This question of strategic avoidance occurs most often in the
study of the United States (Fordham 2005; Meernik 2005), with evidence
that other states avoid and/or initiate fewer disputes with the United
States when the American economy is performing poorly. The empirical
test here using a proportionbased dependent variable might already be
capturing some degree of a strategic avoidance effect, in that some of
the variation in the proportion of initiation could be because the rate
of other states initiating disputes on the crisis-stricken state is
decreasing. [If [strategic avoidance]{.mark} is occurring]{.underline},
[it actually **[increases]{.mark} the [strength]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.mark} aspects of the [diversionary war]{.mark}
literature]{.underline} ([in that [other states are]{.mark} actually
[behaving according to]{.mark} **[expectations of diversionary
actions]{.mark}**]{.underline}), but much more work and nuance would be
needed to separate where then the logic in strategic avoiders is
originating.

The final implication of the findings to be discussed here is the role
of institutions in this analysis. As stated above, the [**[institutional
controls]{.mark}** that were included in the estimation **[demonstrated
null]{.mark} [effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on the overall rate of
militarized dispute initiation]{.underline}. This finding is interesting
considering the enshrined role that institutions and regime types tend
to play within scholarly work on diversionary war. Similar to the mixed
results of GDP indicators, mixed and contradictory results can be found
throughout the body of work on diversionary war: [some find that the
diversionary effects exist mainly in democratic settings]{.underline}
(Gelpi 1997; Davies 2002; Brul´e and Williams 2009), [while others find
that diversionary effects occur in autocratic settings]{.underline}
(Miller 1999; Lai and Slater 2005; Pickering and Kisangani 2010).

[One method]{.underline} of reconciling the conflicting conclusions of
whether democratic or autocratic leaders are more likely to engage in
diversionary behavior [is]{.underline} in direct tests [comparing the
two regime types]{.underline}. Typically, these [comparisons
have]{.underline} either [found the two regime types differ in the
targets that are selected by each]{.underline} (Bueno De Mesquita and
Siverson 1995), [or have found some fault with the way that the regime
types themselves are defined]{.underline}, due to differing incentives
for differing subtypes of regimes (Pickering and Kisangani 2005). In
order to examine the difference between democracies and autocracies, I
split the sample from Model 2 into either of the regime types, using a
score of 6 in the Polity2 measure as a cut-point. [Splitting the sample
has the effect of interacting regime type with all independent
variables]{.underline}, [giving regime specific effects not only for
economic crises]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} also all [control
variables]{.underline}.1

The results of this regime split can be found in Table 2. As can be seen
here, [the effect of economic crises is **positive**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[significant]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} both
instit**[utional settings]{.underline}**. Comparing the coefficients for
economic crisis in Table 2 with those of the original Model 2, [the
likely explanation for why the institutional variables in the original
model **did not have an impact** on crisis initiation is because **all
[democracies]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[autocracies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[possess]{.mark} relatively
[similar]{.mark} **[incentives for increasing crisis initiation
following economic crises]{.mark}**,]{.underline} so [any variation
across institutions was only averaged out]{.underline}. However, the
results presented in Table 2 also provide support for a difference
existing in the process of how diversionary conflict might occur in
either regime type, due to the differences in control variable
significance. This lends some credence to the separation of democracies
and autocracies for study of diversionary war, but provides no evidence
that the effect should only exist in one or the other. [The similarity
in the main independent variable of economic crises]{.underline},
though, [furthers the assertion that the effect of economic crises
**increasing dispute initiation**]{.underline} [can be viewed as a
**general behavior of all states** in the international
system.]{.underline}

Conclusions

Altogether, [[there can be]{.underline}]{.mark} said to be [[a]{.mark}
**[robust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[positive
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between]{.mark} the occurrence of
[economic crises and]{.mark} the [rate of dispute initiation]{.mark} by
states]{.underline}. [This effect is especially strong and demonstrable
when time ordering is preserved by examining how crises in the previous
year affect states in their current year.]{.underline} These findings
can also be said to have a relatively high degree of substantive import
as well. As Figure 1 showed, the occurrence of each subsequent economic
crisis increases the chances of a state initiating disputes by almost
3%. [The nearly [20 percentage point increase]{.mark} in dispute
initiation across the range of the lagged economic crisis
variable]{.underline} also [[represents a]{.mark} **[substantial
impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially **[[considering]{.mark} [the
rare event nature of militarized disputes]{.mark} to begin
with]{.underline}**.

This generalizable finding can have far-reaching impact to both the
study of diversionary war in academia, as well as directly for
policymakers. In academe settings, [there is good evidence to support
the use of acute economic crises over those variables based on the
slowershifting trends of GDP]{.underline} or public opinion
measurements. [[Economic crises act as an]{.mark} **[explicit
trigger]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that can mark a leader's shift into a
losses frame and engage in]{.mark} **[riskier behavior
consistent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} both
**[prospect theory]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[diversionary
war]{.mark} hypotheses]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, applying this observed
effect to the real world would seem to indicate that [if a state goes
through an economic crisis]{.underline}, [other states should have
increased wariness in their dealings with the crisis-stricken state
and/or be more prepared for the possibility of a **new dispute
emerging** in the wake of such an event]{.underline}.

https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/global-arms-trade-usa-increases-dominance-arms-flows-middle-east-surge-says-sipri

(Stockholm, 11 March 2019) The [volume of international transfers of
major arms]{.underline} in 2014--18 [was 7.8 per cent
higher]{.underline} than in 2009--13 and 23 per cent higher than in
2004--2008, [according to new data on arms transfers]{.underline}
published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI). [The ﬁve largest exporters]{.underline} in 2014--18 [were the
United States, Russia, France, Germany and China]{.underline}. Together,
they accounted for 75 per cent of the total volume of arms exports in
2014--18. [The flow of arms increased to the Middle East]{.underline}
between 2009--13 and 2014--18, while there was a decrease in flows to
all other regions. The gap between the USA and other arms exporters
widens [US arms exports grew by 29 per cent]{.underline} between
2009--13 and 2014--18, [and the US share of total global exports rose
from 30 per cent to 36 per cent]{.underline}. The gap between the top
two arms-exporting states also increased: US exports of major arms were
75 per cent higher than Russia's in 2014--18, while they were only 12
per cent higher in 2009--13. [More than half (52 per cent) of US arms
exports went to the Middle East]{.underline} in 2014--18. 'The USA has
further solidified its position as the world's leading arms supplier,'
says Dr Aude Fleurant, Director of the SIPRI Arms and Military
Expenditure Programme. 'The USA exported arms to at least 98 countries
in the past five years; these deliveries often included advanced weapons
such as combat aircraft, short-range cruise and ballistic missiles, and
large numbers of guided bombs.' [Arms exports by Russia decreased by 17
per cent]{.underline} between 2009--13 and 2014--18, in particular due
to the reduction in arms imports by India and Venezuela. Between
2009--13 and 2014--18 France increased its arms exports by 43 per cent
and Germany by 13 per cent. The combined arms exports of European Union
member states accounted for 27 per cent of global arms exports in
2014--18. A small number of countries outside Europe and North America
are large arms exporters. [China was the fifth largest arms
exporter]{.underline} in 2014--18. Whereas Chinese arms exports rose by
195 per cent between 2004--2008 and 2009--13, they increased by only 2.7
per cent between 2009--13 and 2014--18. Israeli, South Korean and
Turkish arms exports increased substantially---60 per cent, 94 per cent
and 170 per cent, respectively---between 2009--13 and 2014--18. Middle
Eastern arms imports almost double in the past five years [Arms imports
by states in the Middle East increased by 87 per cent]{.underline}
between 2009--13 and 2014--18 and accounted for 35 per cent of global
arms imports in 2014--18**[. Saudi Arabia became the world's largest
arms importer in 2014--18, with an increase of 192 per cent compared
with 2009--13.]{.underline}** Arms imports by Egypt, the third largest
arms importer in 2014--18, tripled (206 per cent) between 2009--13 and
2014--18. Arms imports by Israel (354 per cent), Qatar (225 per cent)
and Iraq (139 per cent) also rose between 2009--13 and 2014--18.
However, Syria's arms imports fell by 87 per cent. '[Weapons from the
USA,]{.underline} the United Kingdom and France [are in high
demand]{.underline} in the Gulf region, [where conflicts and tensions
are rife,']{.underline} says Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with

WASHINGTON--- [The U.S. has sold more weapons to other nations in the
first half of fiscal year 2018 than it did in all of fiscal year 2017.
Is that sustainable?]{.underline} It is if you ask [a top State
Department official]{.underline}, . "I [would
anticipate]{.underline}---I am an optimist and a realist---that [next
year's numbers will be higher than this year's numbers,]{.underline}\"
Andrea Thompson, Undersecretary of State- Arms Control and International
Security, said during a Sept. 7 meeting with reporters. That would
appear to be a tall order. According to numbers from the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency, [the U.S. has signed \$46.9 billion in
weapons sales to foreign partners and allies, smashing past the \$41.9
billion figure from all of fiscal 2017]{.underline}. But Thompson points
to [new policies]{.underline} put forth earlier this year from the Trump
administration, [designed to encourage American arms exports and bolster
domestic industry,]{.underline} as a factor that [will have a direct
impact next fiscal year.]{.underline} "The CAT \[conventional arms
transfer\] policy will have been in place, we'll have gained those
efficiencies and feedback from industry and partners," she told the
Defense Writer's Group, adding that the policy is designed to go through
continual updates to keep it relevant. "So I would anticipate that would
increase sales, one would think." [Other policies targeted at
encouraging partners to buy American goods, including dropping
surcharges on products and lowering the cost of transportation for
weapons, are also under way]{.underline}, with DSCA head Lt. Gen.
Charles Hooper leading the charge. [One potential boost could come from
India, a lucrative market that U.S. firms have long eyed.]{.underline}
While travelling to India, Hooper told reporters that he is "quite
confident" that the systems America is selling will find an audience in
India. "Whether it\'s the aerospace domain, land systems or maritime
systems, all of our systems are extraordinarily competitive, and I\'m
sure. will suit India\'s needs now and into the future," Hooper said.
However, any expectations for India should be tempered by reality. The
nation is famously slow to procure weapons, with some deals falling
apart or altering even after contract are signed. Compliance with the
country's Make in India policy is also complicated. Asked about that
challenge, Hooper said [updates to how the DSCA process works, including
greater transparency about costs and timelines at the start of the
process, "helps a great deal" to speed up the process.]{.underline}

per cent of total Top 100 arms sales. [Five US companies were listed in
the top 10]{.underline} in 2017. 'US companies directly benefit from the
US Department of Defense's ongoing demand for weapons,' says Aude
Fleurant, Director of SIPRI's Arms and Military Expenditure Programme.
Lockheed Martin remained the world's largest arms producer in 2017, with
arms sales of \$44.9 billion. 'The gap between Lockheed Martin and
Boeing---the two largest arms producers in the world---increased from
\$11 billion in 2016 to \$18 billion in 2017,' says Fleurant. [Russia

combined arms sales of Russian companies accounted for 9.5 per cent of
the Top 100 total, making Russia the second largest arms producer in the
Top 100 in 2017---a position that had been occupied by the United
Kingdom since 2002. Taken together, the [arms sales of the 10 Russian
companies listed in the Top 100 increased by 8.5 per cent in
2017]{.underline}, to \$37.7 billion. '**[Russian companies have
experienced significant growth in their arms sales]{.underline}** since
2011,' says Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with SIPRI's Arms and

and Tactical Missiles Corporation (19 per cent). The UK remains the
largest arms producer in Western Europe The combined arms sales of the
24 companies in Western Europe listed in the Top 100 increased by 3.8
per cent in 2017, to \$94.9 billion, which accounted for 23.8 per cent
of the Top 100 total. The UK remained the largest arms producer in the
region in 2017, with total arms sales of \$35.7 billion and seven
companies listed in the Top 100. 'The combined arms sales of British
companies were 2.3 per cent higher than in 2016,' says Fleurant. 'This
was largely due to increases in the arms sales of BAE Systems,
Rolls-Royce and GKN.' BAE Systems, which is ranked fourth in the Top
100, is the UK's biggest arms producer. Its arms sales rose by 3.3 per

Farnborough Trump advances 'Buy American' arms sales plans By: Joe Gould

WASHINGTON --- U.S. President Donald [Trump has approved the State
Department's implementation plan for the administration's "Buy American"
push for boosting weapons exports that emphasizes the U.S.
economy]{.underline}, the State Department announced Monday. The Trump
administration is undertaking [an effort to support U.S. defense trade
overseas to strengthen security partnerships, encourage
interoperability, and protect American economic security and
jobs]{.underline}, said the State Department's Tina Kaidanow, who was in
London leading the U.S. delegation at the Farnborough Airshow. "The
point is that it is exactly reflected in a place like Farnborough, where
[we are supporting U.S. economic security,]{.underline} and we are also
achieving a number of national security goals in conjunction with our
important partners and allies overseas," the principal deputy assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs said in a call with
reporters. [The implementation plan for the rule changes]{.underline},
announced in April[, are]{.underline} in part [meant to reverse the
perception that the State Department is a frequent site of logjams in
the Foreign Military Sales process]{.underline}. Officially called the
Conventional Arms Transfer policy, it's intended to help private U.S.
defense firms directly sell some types of weapons and unmanned drones to
allies without the firms having to go through the U.S. government. Since
April, [the U.S. government has been working on implementation plans
with industry,]{.underline} which hailed Monday's move. [Aerospace
Industries Association CEO]{.underline} Eric [Fanning said its
recommendations for a strategic focus, whole-of-government coordination
and enhanced accountability feature prominently]{.underline} in the
implementation plan. "It is absolutely essential for our government and
our industry to get to the right answers on defense trade with our
allies sooner so that we can continue to 'outpartner' our adversaries,"
Fanning said. "Going forward, [we commit to expanding our already robust
dialogue and partnership with the government's security cooperation
enterprise to sustain and grow the competitiveness of U.S. defense
exports." The U.S. already leads the world in arms
transfers]{.underline}. In 2017, the State Department approved \$42
billion in government-to-government sales; and so far this year, 2018 is
on track to beat last year at \$46 billion. [The State
Department]{.underline}, under its plans outlined Monday, [would help
allies to identify critical capability requirements and employ a
whole-of-government effort to expedite transfers.]{.underline} In
February, Kaidanow led a large U.S. delegation to Asia's largest air
show to pitch U.S. arms sales as China's military footprint and
political influence are surging. What's spelled out in State's plans is
competition with adversaries by "[providing allies and partners with
alternatives to foreign defense articles in order to maintain U.S.
influence in key regions."]{.underline} The plans also call for State to
work with the defense industry to build exportability into its designs
and development efforts, expanding support for non-program-of-record
systems, and by incentivizing increased production capacity and timely
delivery. The State Department would tweak relevant rules, like the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations framework; expand and enhance
government advocacy and trade promotion in support of the American
defense industry; and avoid offsets that imperil domestic jobs or reduce
America's technological edge. [The implementation plan may finally give
the Defense Department and military services some much-needed direction
on how to better align itself for arms deals.]{.underline}

#### UQ/Link -- US-Saudi arms sales increasing now, sales critical to the US defense industry and economy 

**Knights, 2018**

(Michael - senior fellow @ The Washington Institute, visited Yemen and
the Gulf coalition states four times in 2018 to observe military
operations, "U.S.-Saudi Security Cooperation (Part 1): Conditioning Arms
Sales to Build Leverage," The Washington Institute,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/u.s.-saudi-security-cooperation-part-1-conditioning-arms-sales-to-build-lev>)

[The U.S.-Saudi strategic relationship is built on]{.underline} a simple
premise: Washington provides physical security for the Saudi state,
while Riyadh serves as a cooperative counterterrorism partner and an
apolitical, responsive supplier to global energy markets. **[Arms
sales]{.underline}** are integral to this relationship: [the task of
maintaining the large Saudi military binds Washington and Riyadh
together, while the kingdom's massive purchases of U.S.]{.underline}
armaments and related services [strengthen the American defense industry
and general **economy.**]{.underline} Traditionally, the relationship
was also based on the expectation that the United States would take the
lead on foreign and security policies to protect Saudi Arabia. Under the
Obama administration, however, this formula was replaced by a
partner-based approach that encouraged the kingdom to develop more
forces capable of providing security on their own. Riyadh subsequently
begun to take unforeseen unilateral action on its self-perceived
security interests, leading to crises such as the brutal war in Yemen,
the isolation of Qatar, the abduction of Lebanese prime minister Saad
al-Hariri, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. These
developments have heightened the sentiment within Congress that U.S.
security cooperation with Saudi Arabia should be reviewed---an attitude
that will likely grow stronger after the November 6 midterm elections.
The push for such scrutiny will become particularly urgent if the
parties involved in the Yemen war fail to establish the lasting
ceasefire called for by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis last week. APPRAISING AMERICA'S BIGGEST ARMS
CUSTOMER Since May 2017, President Trump has repeatedly stated that the
[Saudis intend to buy \$110 billion worth of weapons]{.underline} and
associated services [from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
a figure that appears to include both currently active sales and
memoranda of intent for future sales. Whatever the exact figure
ultimately proves to be, [the scope of Riyadh's planned purchases
is]{.underline} undoubtedly **[gargantuan.]{.underline}** In the past
ten years, [the kingdom has committed to buy more arms]{.underline},
parts, and associated training and maintenance services **[than any
other foreign customer,]{.underline}** [with Congress receiving
notification of \$138.9 billion in potential sales]{.underline}: \$90.09
billion during the eight-year Obama administration and \$48.81 billion
in two years under President Trump. Among the purchases reported by
Congressional Research Service were: \$63 billion on fixed-wing aircraft
systems, including combat and non-combat aircraft, munitions, and
electronic upgrades \$49.2 billion on land warfare systems, including
armored vehicles, artillery, and munitions \$49.1 billion on helicopter
systems, including Apache gunships and utility transports \$24.3 billion
on missile defense, including Patriot missiles and a proposed \$15
billion worth of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems
\$12 billion on naval systems, including a proposed \$11.5 billion worth
of littoral combat ship variants. LAND WARFARE PURCHASES AND THE YEMEN
WAR Saudi Arabia's heavy investment in land warfare systems,
helicopters, and airpower over the past decade is no coincidence. It
began when Houthi rebels inflicted a series of shocking defeats on the
kingdom's border forces in 2009-2010. Since then, the United States has
built up the offensive capabilities of the Saudi Arabian National Guard
and Royal Saudi Land Forces, the elements that spearheaded the kingdom's
ground campaigns in Yemen once the current war broke out in 2015. These
purchases included: Immediate refit after 2010. Initial Saudi
investments in 2010-2013 focused on remedying shortfalls witnessed while
fighting the Houthis, notably the need for up-armored, mine-resistant
troop carriers and armored attack helicopters capable of dishing
out---and taking---heavy punishment. Riyadh also purchased air-to-ground
weapons, sensors, and training packages with the aim of getting the
Royal Saudi Air Force ready to support new ground operations in Yemen.
Resupply during the current war. In addition to clearly defensive
systems (e.g., border surveillance aerostats, counter-battery radars),
the Saudi military sought U.S. resupply of its land forces as they
shifted from defending the border to pushing into Houthi-held parts of
northern Yemen. A proposed sale of 115 M1A2S main battle tanks and
support vehicles failed to obtain congressional approval in September
2016 but is moving forward under the Trump administration. In
March-April 2018, Congress was notified of proposed sales involving
\$2.28 billion worth of munitions and 155 millimeter self-propelled
armored artillery systems for the land forces. Although tank and
artillery systems can be used defensively, they should probably be
viewed as offensive systems given Saudi Arabia's increase in short-range
campaigns extending ten to fifteen miles inside northern Yemen.
PRECISION-GUIDED MUNITIONS Sales of air-delivered precision-guided
munitions (PGMs) are another lightning rod issue in the bilateral
security relationship. Following the 2009-2010 round of hostilities with
the Houthis, the kingdom sought to refresh its stock of antipersonnel
bombs with a large order of 1,300 U.S.-built CBU-105 sensor-fused
weapons (a higher-reliability submunition that manufacturers say does
not qualify as a cluster bomb due to its low malfunction rate). Yet by
November 2015, eight months into the current war, the Saudis had used up
nearly 2,600 PGMs, according to strike metrics compiled by The
Washington Institute. In response, the Saudis requested a \$1.29 billion
package comprising around 19,000 air-delivered PGMs, an order that began
delivery in July 2017. In addition to that package, the Senate narrowly
approved a new \$500 million commercial sale of PGMs to Riyadh in June
2017---the first installment in a mammoth \$4.46 billion series of
air-launched munition deals that would provide the Saudis with 104,000
U.S. PGMs in the next half decade. [Riyadh may be accelerating its
purchases in anticipation of a prolonged war in Yemen]{.underline} and
the potential loss of U.S. sales down the road. According to Washington
Institute data collected in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the kingdom's forces
have used around 14,500 munitions since March 2015, almost all PGMs,
with the average rate gradually declining from 333 PGMs per month in
2015 to 270 per month this year. The U.S. munitions currently arriving
in Saudi Arabia were ordered in November 2015, when Riyadh recognized it
might need new PGMs by 2019, but the intervening years have seen few
signs of a PGM shortfall. [Based on]{.underline} a rough sense of
[prewar stocks and]{.underline} a constant dribble of [replacements,
Riyadh could probably keep bombing at its current rate for several years
even if all new U.S. PGM deals were rejected.]{.underline} Thus, while
[cutting off such sales]{.underline} may be a good way to signal U.S.
displeasure or publicly distance Washington from the war, the data
indicates that it [would not meaningfully slow the air
campaign]{.underline} anytime soon. ADJUSTING U.S. SALES With
U.S.-provided bombs used in many of the war's deadliest civilian
fatality incidents, [Congress has]{.underline} ample [rationale to
block]{.underline}, delay, or condition [future arms sales]{.underline}
to Saudi Arabia. [Depending on]{.underline} the results of this week's
election, the Senate's cross-party, forty-seven-seat opposition to such
sales could become a majority. Saudi intransigence on the Khashoggi case
or Yemen peace talks could also flip more senators into supporting a
joint resolution against new weapons packages. In all likelihood, the
president would veto any such resolution unless Congress can show that
it has carefully weighed the [costs---in terms of both neglecting the
legitimate security needs of a long-term partner and harming America's
status as a security ally and arms vendor]{.underline}.

#### Sales are key to US economy and credibility -- sales are of new weapons and reduction could also hurt allies

'Emergency' or False Alarm? Dana Stroul June 10, 2019 The Washington
Institute
https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-face-off-over-gulf-arms-sales-emergency-or-false-alarm

On June 5, a bipartisan group of senators announced twenty-two separate
joint resolutions of disapproval aimed at blocking various U.S. arms
sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This unusual move
came in response to the Trump administration's May 24 use of the
emergency exception granted under the 1976 Arms Export Control Act
(AECA), which governs how the United States sells weapons to foreign
governments. By declaring this "emergency" and forgoing the required
fifteen- or thirty-day congressional review period, [the administration
created a path to move forward with an estimated \$8.1 billion in arms
sales]{.underline}. To justify the move, officials emphasized the need
to bolster regional allies against the increased threat from Iran. The
face-off exacerbates overlapping debates between the White House and
Congress on three pressing issues: U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia, U.S.
regional strategy to counter Iran, and legislative oversight in the
articulation and execution of foreign policy. Previous stare-downs
include a war powers resolution calling for an end to U.S. military
assistance for Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen, which the
president vetoed in May after it passed the Democratic-controlled House
and Republican-controlled Senate. And in February, the administration
refused to respond decisively when Congress invoked the 2016 Global
Magnitsky Act to request a determination regarding Saudi crown prince
Muhammad bin Salman's role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In both cases, congressional debate centered on whether Washington's
current relationship with Saudi Arabia strengthens U.S. security
priorities or undermines them; members also focused on the broader issue
of asserting the legislature's role in shaping foreign policy. Today,
[Congress continues to devote much of its bandwidth to Saudi
Arabia,]{.underline} the UAE, and U.S. involvement in Yemen, and the
bipartisan Senate group that announced the latest resolutions should
worry the administration. The group includes three ranking members of
powerful national security committees (Foreign Relations, Armed
Services, and Appropriations), as well as two Republican members who
have consistently challenged the administration on Middle East policy.
In their press release describing the resolutions, the senators raised
human rights concerns, the behavior of Crown Prince Muhammad, and the
worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen; they also insisted that there
are more compelling means to counter Iran than weapons sales. And in
defending Congress's oversight role, [they characterized the
administration's use of the AECA emergency exception as "an abuse" that
has "broken the arms sales process."]{.underline} WHICH SALES ARE
SENATORS TRYING TO STOP? The twenty-two Gulf arms deals that the White
House has sought to push through include precision-guided munitions,
aircraft support/sustainment, training programs, and intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. The first item is the
most controversial. Over the past year, Congress has objected to the
sale of precision-guided munitions out of concern that they would
exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in war-torn Yemen. Some members
therefore see the administration's use of the AECA waiver as an end run
around Congress, not a true emergency. Similarly, **[aircraft
maintenance and training deals are important for sustaining partner air
forces,]{.underline}** but their urgency is questionable, and they
struggle to meet the high standards of AECA's emergency provision. At
the same time, **[some of the sales involve U.S. allies]{.underline}**
w[ho are part of related supply chains and technology consortiums (e.g.,
Australia, Britain, France, Israel, Jordan, and Spain)]{.underline},
**[so halting such deals could hurt these countries]{.underline}**. THE
IRAN ANGLE The crux of the debate is the administration's assertion that
[the Iranian threat constitutes an emergency for which weapons sales are
urgently required]{.underline}. Members of Congress have expressed
frustration at the administration's insistence that the threat from Iran
is more acute than before. While no one disputes that Iran transfers
sophisticated weapons to Yemen's Houthi rebels, some members argue that
Saudi and Emirati operations in Yemen have opened space for a deeper
Houthi-Iran relationship. Others have sought to differentiate
"legitimate" security threats---for example, they support U.S. arms
transfers that help counter Iran-supported Houthi missile and drone
attacks inside Saudi Arabia, but they do not want to assist the
coalition air campaign or local Yemeni groups that have exacerbated the
humanitarian crisis and made a political solution more elusive. The
types of sales moving forward under the emergency waiver do not
specifically address the issues that most members of Congress agree are
legitimate, such as missile defense. The administration also faces a
high bar when compared to how past administrations have used the same
authority. For example, President Bush invoked the exception in 1990
after Iraq invaded Kuwait, selling tanks and F-15s to the Saudis. Yet
these weapons came from existing U.S. stocks in Saudi Arabia rather than
new production. **[In the current case, many of the weapons still need
to be manufactured and delivered over years, underlining the elusive
nature of the "emergency."]{.underline}** CAN CONGRESS REALLY STOP THESE
SALES? [The current resolutions of disapproval will not prevent the
White House from moving forward with any of the sales]{.underline}. The
administration's main purpose in using the emergency exception was to
sidestep the standard fifteen- or thirty-day review period, during which
any member of Congress can try to stop a sale through a joint resolution
of disapproval. In essence, the senators are using that same standard
tool for a nonstandard situation. Yet while twenty-two resolutions can
help grab headlines and send a signal to the executive branch, foreign
governments, and the defense industry, they are unlikely to compel
speedy legislative consideration on the Senate floor. [Even if the
Senate and House were to pass some of them, President Trump would no
doubt veto them, and the Senate is unlikely to override him given the
required two-thirds margin]{.underline}. The longer-term implications
are more worrisome. The next major national security legislation coming
up for congressional debate is the annual National Defense Authorization
Act. If members of Congress are denied the standard options for
expressing concern and dissent, they will likely look to more impactful
and longer-lasting options such as amendments to the NDAA. For example,
they could try to limit future arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE
specifically. One could also imagine an attempt to raise the bar even
higher for future presidents to use the emergency AECA provision,
potentially hampering the White House in a credible emergency situation
down the road. Indeed, by invoking the emergency exception, the White
House may have opened a Pandora's box of foreign and economic policy
specters that reach beyond the current Gulf arms deals and Iran threats.
With the precedent set, Saudi Arabia and the UAE may now expect such
expeditious treatment for all defense sales given their place on the
frontline against Iran. Meanwhile, Congress will likely retaliate
against the executive branch's circumvention of the standard review
process by slowing down the approval of future arms sales to these two
governments, further deteriorating their already frayed relations with
Washington. Other countries may seek preferential treatment as well,
citing non-Iran emergencies such as threats from Russia or China. [At a
time when many foreign officials already view the United States as
unreliable, further perceptions of unequal treatment among partners is
unlikely to help]{.underline}. Finally, **[the situation could have
unexpected implications for the defense industry]{.underline}**. [On the
surface, U.S. defense firms have much to gain from the administration's
\$8.1 billion in expedited sales]{.underline}. Yet **[if Congress
decides to constrain sales to certain countries]{.underline}** or boost
its oversight in the long term, **[more global customers may decide that
the costs of doing business with American firms outweigh the
benefits]{.underline}**. [Many buyers are already dismayed by the
procedures and pace of U.S. arms sales and are increasingly looking to
foreign competitors]{.underline}, particularly Russia and China. [A more
pronounced shift in that direction would directly affect the U.S.
economy and undermine a key tool in Washington's effort to remain the
security partner of choice in the Middle East.]{.underline}

What of continuing to work with a murderer? [Saudi Arabia ranks 22nd in
U.S. trade,]{.underline} according to the U.S. Trade Representative.
This would seem paltry, but **[there's massive money to be
made]{.underline}** in oil and gas infrastructure projects, as evidenced
by the decent turnout at the Riyadh investment conference in October,
just a month after Khashoggi's death. [Saudi money]{.underline} also
[flows to the U.S. in the form of weapons sales]{.underline}, to be
sure, but the numbers cited by Trump have proved to be vastly
exaggerated, with Trump's purported \$110 billion figure, touted in a
March 2018 Oval Office meeting with MBS, shown to be mythical. Only
about \$4 billion or \$5 billion in sales were signed since then, and
much higher levels of sales were carried out under Obama. These days,
even small-bore deals are getting unwelcome attention. Last year, \$61
million worth of weapons made in New Hampshire were sent to Saudi by a
company that didn't want itself named publicly. Over the past decade,
[these types of deals---huge orders for weapons that were rarely
used]{.underline}, certainly not on the battlefield---**[were a boon to
American defense contractors]{.underline}**. Congress enthusiastically
supported them. But as images of the grievous attacks and humanitarian
crisis in Yemen reach American televisions, this is starting to change.
[The Saudis]{.underline}, however, **[are dependent on expensive U.S.
weapons]{.underline}** platforms, and [it will be **difficult** for them
to begin buying weapons from Russia or China. Their weapons systems and
aircraft squadrons are all American, and require almost constant
American repairs]{.underline}. As a hardball tactic, Congress could try
to pass laws that would effectively ground the Saudi air force. And the
next administration could condition close military systems collaboration
on Saudi behavior.

relationship]{.underline}. For decades [Saudi Arabia has been an
important American military partner]{.underline} in the Arab world,
where its status as the home to Islam's holiest sites boosts its
leadership credentials. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in
the United States, [the kingdom has played a critical role in U.S.
counterterrorism efforts,]{.underline} [supplying the government with
valuable intelligence]{.underline} about extremist threats. Most
significantly, **[Saudi Arabia has used petrodollars to build up the
Arab world's most sophisticated military arsenal.]{.underline}** [With
one of the world's largest military budgets, the kingdom boasts a large
fleet]{.underline} of F-15 and Tornado fighter jets, Apache helicopters
and other advanced aircraft. [About \$14.5 billion in major sales have
been concluded with Saudi Arabia since Trump became
president,]{.underline} but much or all of that was initiated before he
took office. **[The potential for a shut-off to the lucrative arms
pipeline has alarmed the defense industry.]{.underline}** The **[sales
are even more significant for the administration because, unlike Israel
and Egypt, Saudi Arabia uses its own money rather than U.S. aid to
finance arms purchases.]{.underline}** Although Congress has the power
to broadly halt arms sales or suspend military aid, lawmakers have so
far declined to do so. The Obama administration, frustrated by Saudi
attacks on civilian sites in Yemen, temporarily halted sales of
precision munitions in 2016, but Trump reversed that move after taking
office. [For Saudi Arabia, the race to arm itself has been
aimed]{.underline} not just [at]{.underline} boosting its fighting power
but also [deepening political ties with producer nations like the United
States]{.underline}. The favor those sales have curried was starkly
visible in Trump's Oval Office comments this week.

**Rounds, 2019**

(Ray -- PhD Candidate at Georgetown University in International
Relations and a US Air Force F-15E pilot, "THE CASE AGAINST ARMS
EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR SAUDI ARABIA," War on the Rocks, 16 April 2019,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/>)

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [accounts for 34 percent of all
global arms sales (second place Russia remains a distant 23
percent]{.underline}), and has more than 40 defense companies in the top
100 globally. However, [with civilian deaths caused by the Saudi-led war
in Yemen]{.underline} estimated at between 16,000 and 50,000 by the end
of 2018, [calls for the United States to suspend arms sales to its
largest client --- Saudi Arabia --- have]{.underline} understandably
[gained tractio]{.underline}n in both Congress and the public. More
generally, several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages
calling for more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright
embargos, governed less by economic motivations and more by concern
about blowback, human rights, dispersion, and reducing technology
transfer. I respectfully disagree with all of these recommendations[.
Whether it is delayed approval]{.underline}, as in the recent Kuwaiti
F-18 purchase, [an outright embargo]{.underline}, like Egyptian F-16s in
2013, [or denial of technology transf]{.underline}er, as in the 2016
Turkish Patriot missile request, **[using the withholding of arms sales
as a blunt force instrument of coercion is unlikely to produce desired
strategic benefits and often backfires.]{.underline}**

Arms exports are best used for maintaining or strengthening
relationships while limiting adversary access to client states; a tool
of nuanced influence, not outright coercion. In fact, [threatening to
withhold arms sales]{.underline} to coerce a state into changing its
behavior often [has the opposite effect, leading clients to diversify
their arms sourcing]{.underline} instead of shifting course. Similarly,
calls to restrict technology transfer and worries about demands for
direct offsets mistake what is known as "design technology transfer" for
the much more difficult "capacity" level of transfer. Both are explained
in more detail below, but for now it is worth noting that [design
transfer, the level at which most of these offsets occur, does not lead
to the creation of an independent defense industry]{.underline}, [but
instead provides the United States with a source of political
power]{.underline}. [The United States should not fear technology
transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls, encourage
it]{.underline}. Additionally, while a large domestic market provides
the United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for
political influence, sometimes **[economics do matter; especially when
it comes to preserving complex production lines for future
flexibility]{.underline}**. [Finally, the United States should not look
to use an arms embargo to coerce Saudi policy change]{.underline}, not
for economic reasons, but simply [because it is unlikely to
work]{.underline}.

Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms

Arms sales are useful tools for maintaining communication, strengthening
relationships, and keeping potential adversary states at bay.
Conversely, as a blunt instrument of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X,
we will suspend Y), they are likely losers. Senior U.S. government
officials involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over
the past year during the course of my research have echoed similar
sentiments. [This is]{.underline} also b[orne out by previous research
providing evidence that using arms transfers as]{.underline}
situationally [coercive tools is rarely successful.]{.underline}
Interestingly, [coercion attempts using arms transfers are least likely
to be successful when used as a punishment or threat against an
autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Instead,
punishments in the form of **[an embargo can often push a client to
diversify sourcing]{.underline}** rather than to change behavior.

[Consider Indonesia and Egypt. In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian MiG]{.underline}-29M/M2[s]{.underline} and more than
two-dozen French Rafales. This represented [a shocking turn of events
after more than three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter
jets]{.underline}. It was also [driven]{.underline} largely **[by the
U.S. embargo]{.underline}** put in place in 2013, after the Egyptian
army's removal of then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the
presidency in a 2012 election. [The embargo caused significant
tension]{.underline} between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense
that they were at a point of mortal peril" while the United States was
moralizing about democratic reforms. Remarkably, the United States
lifted the embargo in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian
policies, no official U.S. "democracy certification", and Egyptian
military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. [The U.S. arms embargo
as a tool of coercive change was an abject failure]{.underline}.

A similar story played out [in Indonesia]{.underline} more than a decade
prior. [A long-time arms client of the United States with no history of
Russian imports, Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to
purchase Russian Su-27]{.underline}/30[s]{.underline}. While Indonesia
was always far more politically neutral than Egypt, **[this remarkable
turnaround in arms sourcing diversification appears to be the result of
a U.S. arms embargo]{.underline}** implemented in 1999 in response to
Indonesia's apparent human rights violations carrying out heavy-handed
military actions in East Timor. Furious at U.S. meddling in something
the government considered a domestic issue, **[Indonesia looked instead
to Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\]
arms sales restrictions]{.underline}**." In other words, Indonesia
looked to diversify, not capitulate. [Indonesia continued sourcing
Russian arms even after the United States lifted the embargo in
2005]{.underline}. Perhaps most remarkably, [**even after the United
States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012, the archipelago state
still agreed to purchase 11 Russian Su-35s**. The U.S. attempt at
coercion not only failed but continues to perpetuate negative strategic
effects today.]{.underline}

Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer?

Another argument for a more restrictive arms export policy concerns
[direct industrial offsets]{.underline} (those economic agreements in
which a supplier invests in the industry of a client state directly
related to the arms being transferred) [and technology
transfer]{.underline}. However, these tools [should not be
feared]{.underline}. [Technology transfer is unlikely to breed
meaningful competition]{.underline} for the United States where it
matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets, and instead gives the
United States a source of political influence. The problem in many
analyses is confusion over the type of technology transfer. [There are
three]{.underline} ideal-typical [categories of transfer:
material]{.underline} transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and
machines; [design]{.underline} transfer, like blueprints and schematics;
[and capacity]{.underline} transfer, which involves basic scientific
knowledge and expertise within the industrial base. [Most technology
transfer]{.underline}s ultimately [fall into the first two]{.underline}
categories, despite what a client state might hope for.

[Consider the]{.underline} 2003 [Polish decision to purchase
F-16s]{.underline} from Lockheed Martin with direct offsets valued at
more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of the program value
and the then-largest in commercial history. [Despite this massive
investment, Poland does not design and produce their own fighter
jets]{.underline} today, but rather subsections of American-designed
systems under license. In fact, **[direct offsets provided inroads for
U.S. industry]{.underline}** in the Polish defense industry in a manner
that strongly incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S.
aircraft, and indeed Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the
near future. [Offsets and technology transfer]{.underline} may have
helped revive portions of the Polish defense industry and provided some
domestic job creation, but it [did not create an independent
competitor]{.underline} to the U.S. defense industry. This is exactly as
expected with material and design levels of transfer.

While [some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or
China, might]{.underline} eventually **[create a world-leading defense
industry]{.underline}**, it will remain out of the grasp of most states.
Consider China, an unquestionable economic powerhouse of recent decades.
Despite decades of arms purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse
engineering attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still
turns to Russia for help with the most advanced weaponry such as fighter
jets, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If
China, the second largest economy in the world struggles so mightily,
what threat do smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the
acquisition of basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over
decades, cannot simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked.
Rather, it takes decades of intentional and costly investment. [For
high-end weaponry,]{.underline} where research and development costs
remain a prohibitive barrier to entry, [the United States
and]{.underline} a handful of [other advanced economies are likely to
remain in the driver's seat]{.underline}; even with generous technology
transfer agreements.

Finally, [consider some of the negative]{.underline} second- and
third-order [effects that excessive restriction caused in American
unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot missile system
and its underlying technology to Turkey]{.underline}. This was recently
posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this restraint
looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant design
transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite capacity
transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and anti-missile
defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S. technology, the
United States could have legally restricted Turkey's future export of
it.

More importantly, [Turkey has since agreed to purchase Russia's advanced
S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a blow to U.S. and NATO relations
with Turkey]{.underline}. The S-400 purchase will put advanced Russian
technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and tier-two F-35
industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on several F-35
components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about Turkey's
S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part of the
problem." Even worse, the United States has since approved the sale of
the Patriot to Turkey, with the acting U.S. Defense Secretary recently
commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was holding back on
some surface-to-air missile technology worth the strategic cost? It
appears unlikely.

Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense

As others have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make
economic \[...\] sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security
benefits in arms export decisions. As one author recently explained in
War on the Rocks:

[The United States is]{.underline} so [economically advantaged in making
and selling weapons]{.underline} that it can limit conventional-weapons
proliferation \[and\] ... technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust
defense industrial base) while retaining its commanding market position.

[This is undoubtedly true. However]{.underline}, on rare occasions
**[economics do matter.]{.underline}** Specifically, [**maintaining
strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open** which would
otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.]{.underline}
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15.

[In]{.underline} December [2011, the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off
the assembly line]{.underline}, 554 short of the original program
requirement. At the same time, [close U.S. allies]{.underline} such as
Japan and Australia [made inquiries about purchasing further
increments]{.underline} of the fifth-generation fighter, **[which would
have kept production going]{.underline}** for at least several more
years. [The United States rejected the inquiries, shuttering the
production line instead]{.underline}. A 2011 RAND Corporation study
estimates **[the cost of restarting production and fabricating 75
additional F-22s to be \$17 billion]{.underline}** --- nearly \$227
million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an evolving
international security environment, the US Congress inserted language
into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a
"production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a production
restart remains infinitesimally small.

Fortunately, the outcome is different for the F-15. [In 2013, Qatar made
a request for the purchase of 70 F-15]{.underline}QA[s, worth \$4
billion]{.underline}. At the time[, without another export order the
40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by
2019]{.underline}, eliminating any future purchases. After delaying
approval for nearly three years, the U.S. administration finally
approved the deal in late 2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the
mid-2020s. [Unlike the F-22, the United States maintains strategic
flexibility in F-15]{.underline} (and F-18 and F-16) production,
**[largely because of exports.]{.underline}** This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free."

What About Saudi Arabia?

[In sum, more restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright
embargos are unlikely to succeed]{.underline} in policy coercion. While
arms transfers provide an avenue of influence, [embargos often lead to
diversification]{.underline}, not desired policy changes. Additionally,
[fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a competitor
out of every client are generally unfounded]{.underline} in the high-end
market in which the United States generally deals. Finally, while the
large domestic market provides the United States the luxury of
sacrificing financial gains for political influence, sometimes
[economics do matter, particularly when it comes to saving a production
line for future flexibility]{.underline}.

[These conclusions should therefore inform U.S. policy on Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} The intent here is not to argue the moral or
ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi Arabia's
execution of journalists or tactics in the war in Yemen. It is natural
to see the horror wrought in Yemen and want to take any actions
necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately argue against a Saudi
embargo. This is not because, as the president has argued, it might cost
a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense industry jobs. As
others have pointed out, the economic impact of Saudi arms purchases on
the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather, **[embargoing
Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi policies, but
likely to further damage U.S. ties with Riyadh.]{.underline}**

[In the near-term, Saudi Arabia can substitute other
weapons]{.underline}, such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb
bombs" instead of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The Saudis can also rely
more heavily on their Emirati and Egyptian partners [using non-U.S.
produced arms. In the medium to long term, such an embargo is likely to
push the Kingdom to greater arms diversification]{.underline}. If
history is any guide, the United States will eventually lift any
potential arms embargo with little change in Saudi behavior, but only
after having provided [an opportunity for adversary states such as
Russia and China to gain a strategic foothold in Riyadh.]{.underline}

[Some might counter that it would be extremely difficult and costly, in
both time and money, for the Saudis to significantly
diversify]{.underline} their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. [This is absolutely the case. However,]{.underline} costly does
not mean impossible. **[Less wealthy states have already done
it.]{.underline}** [Egypt]{.underline} is one example above; but others
such as [Venezuela and]{.underline} even tiny [Kuwait]{.underline} ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- [have significantly
diversified their arms acquisition]{.underline}s. In other words, with
the money and options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers
showing a stomach for a full embargo[, it is not unreasonable to believe
that the Saudis might significantly diversify their arms
acquisitions]{.underline} over time in response to a U.S. embargo. Thus,
while a U.S. embargo might be morally compelling and emotionally
satisfying, it is unlikely to create meaningful change for those most at
risk or be strategically beneficial to the United States. In the absence
of a compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on Saudi
Arabia might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers should
look elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

In 2013--17[, 61 per cent of Saudi Arabia's arms imports came from the
USA]{.underline} and [23 per cent from the UK. Several other West
European countries supplied most of the rest]{.underline} (see figure

4. Arms exports to Saudi Arabia by supplier, 2013--17.​​​​​​ **[Efforts by
China and Russia to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia have had limited
success]{.underline}**. However, the deliveries of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs, or drones) from China since 2014---while few in number
and lower in capability compared to the weapons delivered by the USA and
the UK---are still significant as they could mark the beginning of Saudi
Arabia's efforts to diversify the sourcing of its weapons beyond Western
countries. This [diversification is likely to be driven by efforts to
improve its bargaining position on the arms market]{.underline}, to
widen and deepen its international political network [and in order to
minimize the effects of the restrictive arms export policies of current
supplier states]{.underline} on Saudi Arabian arms procurement. The
latter has been of increased relevance as [a number of European states
critical of Saudi Arabia's use of military force in Yemen successively
announced severe restrictions on arms exports to the
Kingdom]{.underline}. The Netherlands led the way in early 2016 and by
late 2018 Germany, Finland and Denmark had followed. However, the main
European arms exporters to Saudi Arabia ---such as the UK, France, Spain
and Italy---have discussed such restrictions but not implemented them.
Similar discussions about restricting arms sales to Saudi Arabia have
been ongoing in the USA. However, the administration of US President
Donald J. Trump decided not to go down this path, arguing that [arms
supplies are important for sustaining relations between the USA and
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}; the US Administration sees Saudi Arabia as
playing a crucial role in maintaining security in the Middle East as a
bulwark against terrorism and as a key player in countering Iranian
influence. In addition, Trump has argued that [arms sales to Saudi
Arabia are a major source of export revenue and involve a significant
number of jobs]{.underline}. Whereas the [security-related arguments are
difficult to quantify]{.underline}, the economic arguments have been
heavily criticized as inflated. For example, according to US Government
sources the value of deliveries of military goods and services to Saudi
Arabia peaked in 2017 at \$6.2 billion, or 0.27 per cent of total goods
and services exported by the USA in 2017.

Indeed, by invoking the emergency exception, the White House may have
opened a Pandora's box of foreign and economic policy specters that
reach beyond the current Gulf arms deals and Iran threats. With the
precedent set, Saudi Arabia and the UAE may now expect such expeditious
treatment for all defense sales given their place on the frontline
against Iran. Meanwhile, Congress will likely retaliate against the
executive branch's circumvention of the standard review process by
slowing down the approval of future arms sales to these two governments,
further deteriorating their already frayed relations with Washington.
Other countries may seek preferential treatment as well, citing non-Iran
emergencies such as threats from Russia or China[. At a time when many

TRUMP'S ARMS EXPORTS POLICY: DEBUNKING KEY ASSUMPTIONS SHIMON ARAD

Defense Forces. His writings focus on Middle East regional security
topics.)

Additionally, **[arms sales figures may be affected by other
administration policy initiatives]{.underline}** outside of CAT, such as
President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Ironically, the [imposition of these tariffs]{.underline} supposedly
based on national security considerations [could undermine U.S. defense
sales]{.underline} by driving up prices or [from
retaliation]{.underline} from affected arms clients. [The
administration]{.underline} also u[ses export rules to improve its
commercial competition]{.underline} over other exporters dependent on
U.S. components. **[This is pushing traditional U.S. arms production
partners to become increasingly wary of continued
cooperation]{.underline}** [and potentially reducing future profits from
the sale of U.S. subsystems to allies and partners.]{.underline} A case
in point is the U.S. refusal to authorize the sale of parts for the sale
of the French SCALP cruise missile to Egypt. The French government is
now seeking to reduce its reliance on U.S.-made components in its weapon
systems in order to increase their exportability, potentially increasing
future competition and reducing U.S. revenues in the future. [From a
European perspective]{.underline}, [the uncertainty surrounding Trump's
commitment to NATO's mutual defense provision]{.underline}, [as well as
his rebukes over their financial commitments]{.underline} to the
alliance **[are unsettling]{.underline}**, especially in light of
Russia's resurgent challenges in Eastern Europe. As the French Armed
Forces Minister, Florence Parly, recently said: [Can we always
count,]{.underline} in every place and in every circumstance, [on
American support?...Listen to the statements of the U.S.
president,]{.underline} read his tweets: The message sent is clear and
without ambiguity...[We have to count on ourselves ... build a European
strategic autonomy.]{.underline} [**On the industrial front, this push
for more strategic autonomy has already prompted some European countries
to increase their independence** in major weapon system
projects]{.underline}, including the development of a next-generation
fighter jet that will compete with the F-35, and a new tank, potentially
reducing markets for the U.S. fighter. This brings us to another set of
assumptions to do with leverage: [Presently, the global arms market,
with the availability of comparable U.S., European, Russian, and Chinese
weapon systems, is **a "buyers' market**]{.underline}." The [prominence
placed by the Trump administration on the economic value of arms sales
reduces U.S. leverage over affluent clients.]{.underline} Presently,
[the administration continues to certify arms exports for Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}'s Yemen campaign in spite of opposition from
Congress, [**out of fear that a cutoff of support could jeopardize \$2
billion in weapon sales to the U.S.'s Gulf allies.** The United States
is not alone in feeling the might of the "buyers' market]{.underline}."
After nixing a planned delivery of 400 laser-guided bombs to Saudi
Arabia because of it's Yemen campaign, Spain reversed its decision once
more. Canceling the delivery might have jeopardized a Saudi order of
five Spanish corvettes worth \$2 billion, with thousands of jobs at
stake. In addition, Germany has approved the delivery of weapon systems
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in spite of a coalition
deal between Germany's ruling parties not to sell weapons to any of the
sides involved in the fighting in Yemen. The desire to increase revenues
from arms exports in the present "buyers' market" is leading the Trump
administration to consider the release of previously denied advanced
capabilities for export. A prime example is the administrations push to
redefine the categorization of unmanned aerial aircrafts to increase
America's share of the global market, that is expected to grow in worth
from about \$6 billion in 2015 to \$12 billion in 2025. Easing previous
restrictions, the administration has also recently given permission to
market armed drones to India as well as to certain countries in Europe
and the Asia-Pacific. The Trump administration is also reported to be
considering the sale of the F-35 to the Gulf states even though this has
been a denied capability given America's commitment to Israel's
qualitative military edge. All told, in the booming "buyers' arms
market" the presumption of approval policy is likely to increase the
diffusion of progressively more advanced U.S. military technologies and
capabilities around the globe. **[Given the circumstances of reverse
leverage, the influence of the U.S. over the use of the arms it exports
is unlikely to be substantial.]{.underline}** The United States has
truly made an about face from the policy of Jimmy Carter.

Air Force secretary advocates for export control fixes amid concerns
over Turkey The Hill. BY ELLEN MITCHELL - 05/29/18
https://thehill.com/policy/defense/389783-air-force-secretary-advocates-for-export-control-fixes-amid-concerns-over

[Air Force Secretary]{.underline} Heather Wilson on Tuesday [hinted that
it may be the United States's fault that]{.underline} NATO ally [Turkey
has agreed to buy a Russian air defense system, pointing to **strict
American export controls.**]{.underline} "We always want our allies to
have equipment that's interoperable and that doesn't pose a threat,"
Wilson said before an audience at the Atlantic Council in Washington.
"Sometimes [it's the United States that's part of the
problem]{.underline}." [Wilson was responding to a question on Turkey's
agreement]{.underline} in December [to buy the Russian-made]{.underline}
S-400 long-range [air and anti-missile defense system. The S-400 is not
interoperable with other NATO and U.S. military equipment and is
expected to create operational problems within the

operational problems]{.underline} \... particularly as it relates to the
location of advanced aircraft in Turkey" like the F-35. [Washington was
expected this year to begin delivery of the first of an eventual 116
F-35 Lightning II fighters to Turkey]{.underline}. The nation has
committed to buying the F-35A variant under the U.S.-led, multinational
Joint Strike Fighter program. **["We would not want to have that
aircraft close to the S-400 and so those discussions are going on with
Turkey]{.underline}**," Wilson added, noting that the State Department
and Pentagon are leading the talks. When asked whether the sale was an
indication of an alliance problem with Turkey, Wilson replied, "no," and
hinted that it was U.S. export controls that were to blame for the sale.
["We've got some of our allies that are trying to purchase unmanned
aerial vehicles,]{.underline} for example, or remotely piloted aircraft.
[We won't sell them ours]{.underline} because of export control and
**[so we force them into a situation where they want to buy unmanned
aircraft or even intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft
that are built by China]{.underline}**," she said.

economic protectionist agenda]{.underline}, including the imposition of

Moreover, as noted above, [some of Washington's major
clients]{.underline}, [such as the Gulf states and India have a
deliberate policy of diversifying their arms imports]{.underline}. A
streamlined U.S. approach to arms exports makes little difference to
deliberate arms diversification strategies adopted by client countries.
At its core, [a policy of diversification is designed to increase
leverage]{.underline} on the United States, [to retain freedom of
action, and to hedge against possible negative U.S. regional policies
and]{.underline} to [push up]{.underline} the [quality]{.underline} of
the capabilities being offered. Therefore, easing U.S. defense export
regulations or reducing surcharge rates will not necessarily make much
difference to the choices that these countries will make regarding the
purchase of American versus non-American-made weapon systems. A case in
point that highlights the potency of self-serving strategic
considerations on the negotiation of arms deals is Qatar. [Following the
severing of diplomatic ties with Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates]{.underline} in June 2017, [Qatar negotiated arms
deals with multiple exporters in an attempt to overcome its regional
isolation and broaden its international support and
partnerships.]{.underline} It signed deals with the U.S. for 36 F-15s
(\$6.2 billion) and precision-guided munitions, with Britain for 24
Eurofighters (\$6.7 billion), with Italy for helicopters (\$3 billion)
and for warships (\$5 billion). In addition, it has negotiated deals
with its regional partner Turkey (\$700 million) as well as with Norway
(\$1.9 billion). The [perception of favorable U.S. long-term regional
policies]{.underline} by clients around the world **[is far more likely
to increase arms sales]{.underline}** than the enhanced processes
incorporated into the new CAT policy.

PARIS --- [France has linked its search for independence from U.S.
export rules]{.underline} with the Franco-German project for a future
fighter jet, in a bid to boost foreign sales of the aircraft, the French
armed forces minister said. France's effort to become less dependent on
U.S. components and promote exports were written into the same letter of
intent signed in June with Germany for the FCAS project, Florence Parly
told AJPAE, the aeronautics and space journalists association, on Sept.
6. "The exportability of the (Future Combat Air System) is a key element
to ensure the economic viability of the program," she said. "We have to
think as upstream as possible to secure this exportability." The
minister previously told parliamentarians **[the French government aims
to cut its reliance on U.S. components in the wake of an American
refusal to authorize the sale of parts for a French Scalp cruise missile
requested by Egypt.]{.underline}** French attempts to persuade
Washington to lift restrictions under U.S. International Traffic in Arms
Regulations have failed. Parly declined to give examples, but she said
the [problems Paris has encountered in the pursuit of foreign arms sales
"stemmed in appearance from strategic factors and in reality from
commercial competition.\" "We are not dupes," she said. France needs to
gradually cut its reliance on certain American components]{.underline},
although it is impossible to be completely independent, she admitted,
adding that there is a plan to reduce that dependence.

Control Programme. Giovanna Maletta is a Researcher in the Dual-Use and

Highlighting the flaws in the current regime
https://www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2018/conflict-yemen-and-eus-arms-export-controls-highlighting-flaws-current-regime

Under the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Export, which was replaced in
2008 by [the EU Common Position]{.underline} on Arms Exports, [member
states of the European Union have committed themselves to achieving
'high common standards' and 'convergence' in their arms export
controls]{.underline}. The standards are outlined in eight
[criteria]{.underline} that [require member states to abide by certain
standard]{.underline}s when assessing licences for arms exports. This
[includes denying licences when there is a 'clear risk' that the arms
'might' be used to commit violations of human rights or international
humanitarian law]{.underline} (IHL) and '\[taking\] into account' the
risk that they will be diverted to an unauthorized end-user or end-use.
Meanwhile, [convergence in member states' controls is promoted through
systems of information sharing]{.underline} and---in cases where one
state wishes to issue a licence for an arms export that another state
has previously denied---a commitment to consult one another. However,
decision-making in arms export licensing falls under states' national
competence and there is no formal mechanism at the EU level to sanction
non-compliance with the Common Position. As such, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), parliamentarians and academics have often
questioned whether EU member states are applying the criteria of the
Common Position correctly and consistently. [Questions about the
implementation of the Common Position have been]{.underline}
particularly [highlighted by]{.underline} the contrasting policies of EU
member states on the [export of arms to states in the Saudi-led military
coalition]{.underline} [engaged in the conflict in Yemen]{.underline}
since 2015.\[1\] There have been multiple reports by United Nations
agencies and NGOs alleging that [the coalition has violated IHL
standards]{.underline}, including through widespread and systematic
attacks on civilian targets and a failure to appropriately distinguish
between civilian and military objects.\[2\] These [reports]{.underline}
will be the subject of a 'comprehensive examination' conducted by a
group of experts appointed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
They [have]{.underline} also [led some EU member states to restrict or
halt arms exports]{.underline} that are likely to be used in Yemen to
certain members of the coalition, and [the European Parliament has
called for the EU to impose an arms embargo on Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. However, other member states have implemented no
such constraints, and others have allowed exports to the coalition to
increase. Differences in exports and policies On 14 February 2018, the
19th EU Annual Report on Arms Exports, which covers the arms export
licences, licence denials and arms exports of member states during 2016,
was released. On 12 March the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, which
provides quantitative and qualitative data on all states' arms imports
and exports, was updated to cover 2017. When combined, the two data sets
point to an increase in arms acquisitions by states in the Saudi-led
coalition and the significant but contrasting role that EU member states
are playing in this trade. According to SIPRI data, the leading members
of the Saudi-led coalition---Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE)---were the 2nd and 4th largest arms importers during 2013--17,
respectively. Exports to Saudi Arabia rose by 225 per cent, and exports
to the UAE rose by 51 per cent. In both cases, EU member states were
among the largest suppliers. The United Kingdom and France were the
second and third largest suppliers to Saudi Arabia in 2013--17, and
France and Italy were the second and third largest suppliers to the UAE.
[The EU Annual Report points to an increase in the number of denials of
licence applications for arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE
between 2015 and 2016]{.underline}. The number of **[licence denials
rose from 7 to 18 for Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and from 9 to 17 for
the UAE. The majority of these denials were issued on the basis of
concerns about human rights or IHL and the risk of diversion. However,
the EU Annual Report also indicates a rise in the overall value of
licences issued for these destinations. The [value of export licences
issued for arms transfers to Saudi Arabia fell by 29 per
cent]{.underline} but significant increases for the UAE meant that,
overall, the value of licences issued for both states rose from €32
billion to €43 billion. These figures should be treated with caution
given differences in the way they are collected. The data on the number
of licences issued (which shows a majority of exports coming from a
small group of states) may potentially be more informative: during 2016
France, Germany and the UK accounted for 85 per cent of the export
licences issued for transfers to Saudi Arabia and 76 per cent of those
issued for the UAE. The variation in exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE
are partly due to the differences in the size and capabilities of EU
member states' arms industries. However, it also reflects the
significant difference in national policies. The conduct of the conflict
in Yemen has triggered national debates throughout the EU about whether
arms exports to states that are part of the Saudi-led coalition are in
line with the criteria of the EU Common Position. However, these debates
have resulted in different outcomes. [The Netherlands]{.underline} and
the Belgian region of Flanders [have indicated that they are denying
licences]{.underline} for the export of arms that might be used in air
or ground operations in Yemen, and [Sweden has adopted a restrictive
approach]{.underline}. Since the start of 2018 [Germany has also
announced that it will no longer be issuing licences for arms that will
be used in the conflict.]{.underline} In addition, the Belgian region of
Wallonia has announced that it will not supply arms to a certain section
of the Saudi military.

in Major Arms Deals in First Year 03/08/18 William Hartung
https://securityassistance.org/publication/trump-makes-over-80-billion-major-arms-deals-first-year

[A report]{.underline} released today [by the Security Assistance
Monitor]{.underline} (SAM) program of the Center for International
Policy [documents over \$80 billion in U.S. arms sales notifications to
Congress during the Trump Administration's first year]{.underline} in
office. The Trump Administration total of \$82.2 billion for 2017
slightly exceeded the Obama Administration's total of \$76.5 billion for
2016, and was [more than \$20 billion less than the peak year of the
Obama Administration]{.underline}'s major arms sales offers in 2010.
Some of [the biggest differences in]{.underline} major [arms sales
offers]{.underline} in 2017 compared to previous years [are the types of
weapons]{.underline}. The bulk of major arms offers during President
Obama's final year focused on sales of military aircraft. In contrast,
[the largest category]{.underline} of arms sales offers under the Trump
Administration [has been bombs and missiles, driven by major missile
defense deals with Saudi Arabia, Poland, Romania, Japan, and the United
Arab Emirates]{.underline}. Overall, the Trump Administration proposed
40 notifications in this category, which is [a 30 percent
increase]{.underline} over 2016. There were notable differences between
the Trump and Obama Administration on human rights. In 2017, t[he Trump
Administration lifted Obama-era suspensions on specific arms deals to
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Nigeria]{.underline}. "Signing off on missile
and bomb sales to Saudi Arabia when the country was using these weapons
to attack the civilian population in Yemen sent an alarming signal about
the U.S. support for human rights," said Colby Goodman, the Director of
the Security Assistance Monitor and editor of the report. [A key
reason]{.underline} President [Trump touted arms sales]{.underline} in
2017 [was to create "jobs]{.underline}, jobs, jobs," as the President
put it during a visit to Saudi Arabia in May of 2017. However, the Trump
Administration approved 16 deals in 2017 and eight in January 2018 to
help foreign countries create arms manufacturing jobs in their
countries. "This is not the 'America First' economic policy that has
been touted by the Trump Administration," notes William D. Hartung, the
author of the new report, entitled Trends in U.S. Arms Sales 2017:
Comparing the Obama and Trump Administrations. "These deals may also cut
U.S. manufacturing jobs in the future with increased competition from
overseas." [This report is made possible because of improvements in the
transparency of U.S. arms sales notifications]{.underline} in recent
years. But [while some types of arms sales transparency is up, export
controls may be going down]{.underline} as the Trump Administration
seeks to reduce restrictions on firearms exports, including removing
notifications to Congress on firearms sales. There are also reports
about expediting the approval process for the Pentagon's Foreign
Military Sales (FMS) system.

TRUMP'S ARMS EXPORTS POLICY: DEBUNKING KEY ASSUMPTIONS SHIMON ARAD
SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 (Shimon Arad is a retired colonel of the Israeli
Defense Forces. His writings focus on Middle East regional security
topics.)
https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trumps-arms-exports-policy-debunking-key-assumptions/

[The United States dominates the growing global arms market]{.underline}
and according to data gathered by the authoritative Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), its lead is expanding.
The United States accounted for 34 percent of total arms exports between
2013 and 2017, ranking it significantly higher than its main competitors
Russia (22 percent), France (6.7 percent), Germany (5.8 percent), China
(5.7 percent), and Britain (4.8 percent). In FY 2018, the value of
signed arms deals continued to increase, reaching over \$46 billion,
exceeding the \$41 billion figure of FY 2017. Undergirding this policy
is Trump's vision that economic security is national security. **[The
defense and aerospace industry is America's second-largest gross
exporter]{.underline}**. [The industry contributes approximately \$1
trillion annually to the U.S. economy and employs around 2,500,000
people. On average, **30 percent of the industry's annual revenue is
through arms exports**]{.underline}, [which reduces the need for
domestic investment, reduces the cost-per-unit for the U.S. military,
and enables an increase of investments in innovation, thereby retaining
America's technological lead.]{.underline} However, a **[number of
trends combine to make Washington nervous about its lead in global arms
sales]{.underline}**. [The first is a growing effort by other
technologically innovative arms exporters to compete with the United
States for markets. Arms sales by Britain, France, Spain, China, and
Russia have reduced America's potential share of the important markets
of the Middle East]{.underline} (49 percent of the U.S. arms exports
between 2013 and 2017) [and Asia.]{.underline} To a certain extent, the
people behind the new CAT policy believe that the strict and rigid
regulatory and procedural frameworks that governed the arms exports
processes have undermined the U.S. competitiveness in the global arms
market and the implementation of the new policy is anticipated to
increase sales. [A second trend is the deliberate policy of client
states to diversify]{.underline} their arms purchases. [The Arab Sunni
states]{.underline}, for example[, have]{.underline} in the last couple
of years [spent tens of billions of dollars on European or Russian arms
rather than on U.S.-made weapon systems]{.underline}. Even a country
like Egypt, which has received nearly \$80 billion in military and
economic aid over the past 30 years, has tapped from its reserves and
loans from Gulf states and from suppliers in order to purchase at least
\$13 billion worth of arms since 2013 from France, Russia, and Germany
rather than from the United States. The new CAT policy aims to encourage
allies and partners to buy U.S.-made arms, including by increasing
competitiveness by dropping surcharges on products and lowering the
costs of transportation. [A third trend is the growing demands of client
states for more substantial offsets]{.underline} and localization of
production and maintenance, including the transfer of technology. Thus,
for example, under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia wants to eventually
subject foreign military contracts to a 50 percent localization rule,
based on a partnership model that includes the sharing of technologies
and skills. The Middle East's growing armored vehicles market, which is
expected to reach more than \$31 billion by 2021, is an example of a
growing demand for the transfer of technical knowledge which is used to
strengthen an indigenous defense sector that has already begun to export
its own products. Some Western European countries are more forthcoming
on this issue than the United States. However, some U.S. companies have
begun forming subsidiaries abroad.

[The United States is]{.underline} so [economically advantaged in making
and selling weapons]{.underline} that it can limit conventional-weapons
proliferation \[and\] ... technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust
defense industrial base) while retaining its commanding market position.
[This is undoubtedly true. However]{.underline}, on rare occasions
**[economics do matter.]{.underline}** Specifically, [**maintaining
strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open** which would
otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.]{.underline}
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. [In]{.underline}
December [2011, the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the assembly
line]{.underline}, 554 short of the original program requirement. At the
same time, close U.S. [allies]{.underline} such as Japan and Australia
[made inquiries about purchasing further increments]{.underline} of the
fifth-generation fighter, **[which would have kept production
going]{.underline}** for at least several more years. [The United States
rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line]{.underline}
instead. **[A 2011 RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of
restarting production and fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17
billion]{.underline}** --- nearly \$227 million per jet. Despite this
cost and because of an evolving international security environment, the
US Congress inserted language into the 2017 defense budget directing the
U.S. Air Force to conduct a "production restart assessment," though [the
likelihood of a production restart remains **infinitesimally
small.**]{.underline} Fortunately, [the outcome is different for the
F-15.]{.underline} In 2013, [Qatar made a]{.underline} request for the
[purchase]{.underline} of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time,
[without another export order the]{.underline} 40-year old F-[15
production line was slated to close by 2019, eliminating any future
purchases]{.underline}. After delaying approval for nearly three years,
the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in late 2016,
guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. **[Unlike the F-22, the
United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15]{.underline}**
(and F-18 and F-16) **[production, largely because of
exports.]{.underline}** This appears to be an especially prescient
decision, as t[he FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget proposal requests money
to purchase at least eight]{.underline} (and up to 100) [F-15EX air
superiority platform]{.underline}s; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is [only possible because other countries have
spent]{.underline} roughly \$5B over the last couple of decades [to
continuously evolve the F-15]{.underline} into what it is today \[...\]
basically, **[the \[Air Force\] is getting \[these upgrades\] for
free."]{.underline}**

NONE --- [The final F-22 Raptor fighter rolled off the]{.underline}
Lockheed Martin [assembly line]{.underline} in Marietta on Tuesday,
[signaling the end of a two-decade program that produced one of the most
lethal]{.underline} \-- and most expensive \-- [warplanes
ever.]{.underline} Tuesday's celebration included a marching band and
speeches from Lockheed officials about the tenacity of employees who
worked on the program. "It was a hard-fought program to bring here and
these folks have proved that they could build the most advanced aircraft
in the world," said Shan Cooper, general manager of the Marietta
facility. Most F-22 workers will move to Lockheed's other programs or
provide support for the F-22 fleet. [Money for the program was
cut]{.underline} in 2009, 18 years after Lockheed won a contract in 1991
to begin building a successor to the F-15 as the Air Force's primary
"air superiority" fighter. The program gave a new dimension to the
Marietta plant, known best for producing cargo planes. As it moved into
production, the F-22 was dogged by criticism of its cost and usefulness
in the post-Cold War era. **[The plane boasts an unprecedented
combination of stealth, maneuverability and firepower]{.underline}**,
but it has not been used in Iraq or Afghanistan. In all, the plant built
195 F-22s \-- about a quarter of originally projection. The Air Force
pegs the per-plane cost at \$143 million, although estimates range to
more than double that including all development costs. Despite the
criticism, [the plane is serving its purpose well,]{.underline} said
Jeff Babione, vice president and general manager of the F-22 program.
["It's been deployed around the world and our adversaries know that it's
close by]{.underline}," he said. "The way I talk about it is: [the most
effective weapon is the one that's never used]{.underline}." Assembly
line tooling will be stored, along with photos, video and detailed

The executive branch proposes and Congress reviews arms sales on a
case-by-case basis.6 The [sale of F-22s to Japan]{.underline} raises
both broad questions about the security environment in East Asia and
questions that are specific to domestic interests. Factors that argue
for a transfer [include potential benefits to U.S. industry,
contribution to the defense of allied countries, and promoting U.S.
interoperability]{.underline} with those countries. Factors that argue
against a particular arms transfer include the likelihood of technology
proliferation and the potential for undermining regional stability.7
U.S. Industrial Base [Exporting F-22s to Japan is one way to keep the
F-22 production line running after U.S. Air Force procurement
ends]{.underline}. Lockheed Martin, the F-22 prime contractor, estimates
that it employs 3,351 F-22 workers at three plants (Marietta, GA; Fort
Worth, TX; Palmdale, CA). Many others -- perhaps [as many as 25,000 --
are]{.underline} also [employed by major subcontractors]{.underline}
Pratt & Whitney and Boeing, [and by companies that produce F-22 parts
and sub-components]{.underline}. Generally speaking, **[promoting
employment in the aerospace sector is beneficial to the U.S.
economy.]{.underline}** However, some aerospace jobs are more important
to promoting U.S. industrial competitiveness than others. At this stage
of production, more F-22 employees are involved in aircraft assembly,
which is relatively rote and unskilled compared to the design and
engineering skills required earlier in the aircraft's development and
initial production. [Keeping the F-22]{.underline} production [line open
by building aircraft]{.underline} for Japan wou[ld also help the prime
contractor reduce per-aircraft costs]{.underline}, because [labor and
manufacturing processes become more efficient over time,
and]{.underline} because [sunk costs,]{.underline} such as R&D or
capital investment, w[ould be amortized over a larger number of
aircraft.]{.underline} DoD and U.S. taxpayers would only benefit from
reduced per-aircraft costs, however, if the Air Force were to purchase
more F-22s after those produced for Japan, and in addition to the 183
aircraft currently planned[. A final industrial base issue pertains to
the F-35]{.underline} Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Although originally
intended to be complementary aircraft, [F-22 and JSF capabilities,
development, and production have converged]{.underline}. Implicitly if
not explicitly, these aircraft are competing for scarce procurement
funds. Extension of F-22 production would likely bring these aircraft
into even sharper competition. On the other hand, F-22 supporters
argue[, keeping the F-22 production line alive could serve as a useful
hedge against any potential delay in]{.underline} JSF
[production]{.underline}. Technology Transfer [Air Force leaders have
consistently touted the F-22 as the world's most technologically
advanced and capable fighter aircraft]{.underline}. Protecting U.S.
intellectual property in these technologies and denying access to
adversaries are high national security priorities. It is unclear whether
the United States and Japan could agree on the capabilities to be
offered in the export variant of the F-22. Japan would likely want an
aircraft the same as, or similar to, that flown by the U.S. Air Force,
and would also likely prefer to license or co-manufacture the aircraft,
which gives them more opportunity to acquire engineering and design
knowledge, and technology transfer. Presumably, DoD would desire to
export a less capable aircraft, in part to protect key technologies, and
would have a strong aversion to license or co-production. Japan has
traditionally placed great value on developing industrial defense
"autonomy," that is, indigenous weapons production, although this
imperative has relaxed somewhat in recent years, in part to cooperate
with the United States on missile defense.8 The potential for technology
transfer touches upon both military and economic concerns. Unlike some
countries, Japan does not have a track record of re-exporting technology
that it acquires through import. However, an inadvertent leak of U.S.
technology or knowledge could also be a threat. The leak of secret data
associated with the Aegis weapon system by Japanese military personnel
in 2002 is an example of this potential danger.9 Japan is a military
ally, but also considered by some to be an economic rival. Many of the
F-22 technologies or industrial processes could have commercial
application. Some may be concerned that F-22 technology or knowledge
could find their way into a myriad of Japanese products, to the
competitive detriment of U.S. industry. A second proliferation issue
relates to the effect an F-22 sale could have on other countries. Other
countries in the region could perceive the F-22 as causing an imbalance
of military power in favor of Japan, and inciting them to seek their own
advanced aircraft or defensive systems. Once Japan sets the precedent of
F-22 export, other countries might pressure U.S. policy makers to sell
them F-22s. Israel, for example, has reportedly expressed interest in
the F-22. Interoperability and Interdependence [Bilateral agreements aim
to expand the benefits of the alliance by increasing the
interoperability of the U.S. and Japanese militaries]{.underline},
therefore [multiplying their collective capability]{.underline}. Several
joint facilities are planned, including an air operations coordination
center at Yokota Air Base, to be operational by 2010. Japan's
acquisition of the F-22 would boost interoperability because both
[militaries could use identical, state-of-the-art
equipment]{.underline}. Because of the U.S. security guarantee to Japan,
Japan's possession of the F-22s may allow the United States to rotate
its own aircraft out of the region when necessary. Similarly, by
fielding the F-22, Japan could make up for the deficit of 198 Raptors
the U.S. Air Force says it needs but cannot afford. Despite these
ambitions, however, achieving true interoperability is a difficult task.
Constitutional, legal, and normative constraints limit SDF participation
in many of the operations and training that traditionally integrate
different national forces (see section below). Increasing the
sophistication of bilateral training requires funding and facilities,
currently under pressure because of SDF's budget requirements. Language
barriers and differences in military doctrine also present challenges.
In addition, localities affected by the noise of military bases,
particularly those hosting aircraft, have been vocally opposed to many
of the U.S. troop realignment proposals.

First, and most importantly, the United States must remain stingy about
transferring technology to potential competitors. The Trump
administration should reiterate the longstanding policy of "unilateral
restraint." This is not only a strategic interest but an economic one as
well, as it hinders proliferation of technology and the spread of
competition for American products from emerging exporters. More broadly,
the United States should consider economic incentives, such as producing
jobs in client states rather than at home, in place of technology
transfer to close arms deals. [The potential for unilateral restraint in
drones is over.]{.underline} To date, the United States has been
extremely discrete in exporting unmanned systems (particularly armed
ones). But somewhat comparable products are now readily available from
multiple sources in the global market. Over the past five years Israel
has filled the gap, delivering 43 percent of all drone exports, with
China a rising competitor at 32 percent (source SIPRI). If the United
States begins exporting unmanned aerial vehicles more freely,
**[American drones are likely to both dominate the market and be subject
to more rigorous regulation]{.underline}**. That said, the economic boom
is likely to be modest; the entire annual military unmanned aerial
vehicle market is projected to be under \$10 billion as late as 2026.
**[The security benefits for the United States of drone exports remain
considerable]{.underline}** however. [Interoperability among networked
drones from multiple countries will likely play an enormous role in
future "informationalized" conflict. Strong security incentives exist
for the United States to ensure that allies operate its unmanned
systems.]{.underline}

Strict export regulations may be costing US industry billions in foreign
sales By: Daniel Cebul   June 18, 2018
https://www.defensenews.com/newsletters/unmanned-systems/2018/06/18/strict-export-regulations-may-be-costing-us-industry-billions-in-foreign-sales/

WASHINGTON ― A new RAND report assessing the proliferation of unmanned
aerial vehicles suggests existing export controls for drones may hurt
the U.S. more than it helps. **[Limiting U.S. drone exports has left a
hole in the global market for the technology]{.underline}**, especially
in historically U.S.-dominated Middle East markets, [which has been
readily filled by U.S. competitors --- specifically China and
Russia]{.underline}. The Trump administration recently unveiled a new
set of export policies regarding military technology in an attempt to
facilitate the transfer of military technology, but the changes do not
change the status of drones under the Missile Technology Control Regime,
or MTCR. How does the MTCR work? The MTCR is a voluntary export control
consortium of 35 nations designed to prevent signatories from
proliferating longer-range cruise and ballistic missile technology. The
arms control regime was extended to UAVs because early iterations of
drones were considered a subset of cruise missile technology due to
their active guidance system. The regime divides missiles into two
categories. Category I items are capable of delivering a 500 kg payload
more than 300 km. The sale of category I systems is restricted by a
"strong presumption of denial," meaning they are only exported in rare
circumstances. The MQ-9 Reaper, RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-4 Triton are
well-known unmanned systems that fall under this category. [Over the
past several years, U.S. partners such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia and UAE
were denied requests to purchase American drones, and have since turned
to China]{.underline} to purchase comparable systems. [Trump
administration officials have been attempting to alter the regime by
adding new language]{.underline} that would drop any vehicle that flies
under 650 kilometers per hour to category II systems. [This would make
all but the most advanced U.S. systems available for international
sal]{.underline}e. For example, the MQ-9 Reaper clocks in with a cruise
speed of 230 mph or 370 kph, according to an Air Force facts sheet.
Drone proliferation [RAND found that 10 nations operate category I
drones, and more than 15 operate near-category I systems]{.underline}
that register just below the MTCR's payload and distance restrictions.
The report says [increased proliferation rates are due to a handful of
countries, specifically China, Israel and the United Arab
Emirates]{.underline}, who are not party to the MCTR. [More countries
are expected to procure drones, which pose a "growing threat to U.S. and
allied military operations,"]{.underline} the report says. While
[category I systems can deploy missiles and other guided munitions,
their main threat lies in "their ability to conduct intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations against U.S. forces
prior to hostilities]{.underline}," according to RAND. "[Adversaries
that would otherwise have difficulty detecting U.S. force deployments,
monitoring U.S. operations, and maintaining targeting data on U.S. units
can employ UAVs to maintain situational awareness of U.S. capabilities"
**The report identifies Russia, China and Iran as unfriendly nations
that will seek to utilize drones to complicate U.S. military
operations.**]{.underline} For example, [China and Saudi Arabia recently
agreed to set up a UAV manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
for up to 300 new UAVs, and Italy will receive 20 Hammerhead UAVs from
the UAE. The [coproduction of regional drone factories "could further
exacerbate the proliferation of large UAVs to the degree that these
systems are exported to other nations," according to RAND, and that
hurts U.S. industry.]{.underline} A U.S.-sized hole Voluntarily
restricting U.S. drone exports have allowed competitors to establish
themselves in a market Rand expects to "grow from about \$6 billion in
2015 to about \$12 billion in 2025." **[RAND expect export controls to
have a negative impact on the U.S. industrial base,]{.underline}**
something those in industry already know. "[What you are enabling the
competition to do is]{.underline} not just to sell some hardware,"
Linden Blue, General Atomic's chief executive, told reporters during an
Aug. 16, 2017 roundtable at the company's headquarters in Poway,
California. "You're enabling it to [build a customer base for at least
20 years,]{.underline} I would say. You're enabling them to build a
logistics system[. It will take them many years to get to where we are
right now, but you're helping them start]{.underline} out. They should
be very thankful."

#### Arms sales key to the American defense industry and jobs -- US Chamber of Commerce 

**Defense News 18**

US Chamber of Commerce wants Trump to put America's defense industry
first By: Joe Gould   June 20, 2018
https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2018/06/19/us-chamber-of-commerce-wants-trump-to-put-americas-defense-industry-first/

WASHINGTON --- [America's biggest business lobby wants the Trump
administration put the American defense industry first]{.underline} [and
require the Pentagon to explain the impact on domestic jobs]{.underline}
and national security [each time it denies a foreign request to buy U.S.
weapons.]{.underline} [The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has]{.underline}
some 30 **[recommendations on how to hard-wire economic security and
defense-industrial base considerations into the government's
international arms sale decisions.]{.underline}** The intent is to see
the proposals, which put a heavy accent on business interests, taken up
by the administration or Congress. [Defense News was given exclusive
access to the recommendations, from the Chamber of Commerce's new
Defense and Aerospace Export Council,]{.underline} before they are made
public this week. The recommendations were sent to Peter Navarro, a lead
trade adviser to President Donald Trump, and Undersecretary of State for
Arms Control and International Security Affairs Andrea Thompson. ["Goals
like 'economic security' need to be transformed into]{.underline}
bureaucratic and [organizational imperatives in order to produce
near-term impact,]{.underline}" Defense and Aerospace Export Council
President Keith Webster said in the June 8 letter to Navarro and
Thompson. Webster was President Barack Obama's last director of
international cooperation at the Pentagon. While the State Department
has long been legally bound to notify Congress and seek approval for
proposed foreign arms sales, the chamber recommended that any proposed
denial of a sale also require a report to Congress. [That report would
have to explain whether the denied country can get similar equipment
from a foreign competitor --- and detail the denial's impact on American
jobs, revenue and the U.S. industrial base.]{.underline} Such reports
would also be available to the manufacturer of the item in question,
under the proposal. Prime contractors would also be notified in advance
of an export authorization denial "to ensure that all economic factors
have been taken into account in the decision-making process," Webster
wrote. The recommendations, if implemented, would impact a number of
agencies. Among them, the military services would be required to
incorporate economic factors into their technology release baseline
policies, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would
prioritize and monitor defense trade relationships through the global
export market. Andrew Hunter, a former Pentagon acquisition official now
with the Center for Strategic and International Studies had yet to see
the recommendations, but called "compelling" the idea of government
engaging industry and partner nations to propose modifications or
solutions to government concerns on stalled cases. But if the government
were required to reveal job impacts when deals are denied, there's
potential for wasted time and resources. That, Hunter said, "may focus
too much on deals that may not be viable, and too little on deals that
are likely to make the cut with sufficient focus and attention that
currently tend to sit in limbo." Among other recommendations, the
council would have the government --- instead of simply turning down
countries that cannot adequately secure sensitive defense technologies
--- list countries with problems doing so and have the Defense
Technology Security Administration actively offer to work with those
countries to get them up to snuff. Webster also warned that the State
Department hiring freeze, lifted last month, is slowing foreign military
sales. The administration, he said, should remedy a 30 percent vacancy
rate at State's Defense Trade Controls Directorate, where the workforce
is stressed by growth in foreign military sales as well as a diminished
workforce at the Department of Defense. As a presidential candidate,
Trump campaigned on the promise of a giant military spending hike and on
creating and protecting domestic jobs. Since taking office, Trump has
tweaked arms export regulations and used face-to-face meetings with
foreign leaders to pitch U.S. weapons sales, while administration
officials have promised a deeper advocacy with foreign officials for
defense sales that are in America's national interest. [The chamber's
Defense and Aerospace Export Council hailed the Trump administration's
Conventional Arms Transfer policy, announced in April and aimed at
helping private U.S. defense companies directly sell some types of
conventional weapons and unmanned drones to allies without them having
to go through the U.S. government.]{.underline} Those policy changes
have been criticized both as an over-hyped continuation of a
long-standing policy and as emphasizing domestic jobs over human rights.
Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center
for International Policy, called the Chamber of Commerce's
recommendations "misguided and dangerous" --- a view that is likely to
be representative of the nonproliferation community at large. "The Trump
administration is already bending over backwards to serve the interests
of U.S. arms exporters. The notion that the administration should go
further in prioritizing industry's needs over questions of proliferation
and human rights is both misguided and dangerous," Hartung said.
"Weapons are different from any other export and should be subjected to
greater scrutiny and stricter criteria. The Chamber of Commerce's
proposals ignore this essential fact." However, Webster's letter warned
that counter-proliferation policies aimed at preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction have had the effect of encouraging some
foreign countries to obtain non-U.S. capabilities --- all without
America's end-use monitoring requirements, interoperability exercises or
the chance for the U.S. to shape policies around their use. One key area
that Webster addresses is easing sales of U.S. military drones overseas.
The council would have the administration establish a policy of
overcoming the Missile Technology Control Regime's "strong presumption
of denial" for exporting any "category-1" system capable of carrying
500-kilogram payloads for more than 300 kilometers. The policy would
have the State Department and Defense Department evaluate drone export
authorization requests as they would manned aerial defense platforms
that can deploy like payloads. Second, the policy would permit the
export to nonmembers of the MTCR, an agreement among 35 nations meant to
prevent signatories from proliferating longer-range cruise and ballistic
missile technology. Webster presents this as an alternative to amending
the MTCR, a laborious process that would allow competitors time to grab
the market share. "**[Urgency is required to sustain U.S. leadership in
this market]{.underline}**," he wrote. [Webster argued in his letter
that America's restrictive drone export policy means "China is now able
to fill that hole]{.underline} with UASs that look remarkably similar to
America's MQ-1B Predator, MQ-9 Reaper and Global Hawk." **[A new report
by the think tank Rand forecast existing export controls will have a
negative impact on the U.S. industrial base,]{.underline}** while China,
Israel and the United Arab Emirates, who are not party to the MCTR, are
proliferating their own drones. **[U.S. competitors have established
themselves in a market set to "grow from about \$6 billion in 2015 to
about \$12 billion]{.underline}** in 2025," Rand found.

[The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit]{.underline} conventional-weapons
[proliferation, technology diffusion, and corruption]{.underline} in
contracting arrangements ([and maintain a robust defense industrial
base]{.underline}) while retaining its commanding market position. Less
powerful exporting states are generally too constrained by the economics
of production to pursue any goals besides increased sales. **[There are
a number of ways in which America's leverage in the area of arms
sales]{.underline}** --- and, therefore, its ability to exercise
restraint --- [can further its foreign policy goals.]{.underline}

Lower Levels of Corruption Lead to More Capability

[America's ability to walk away from any given arms deal helps
reduce]{.underline} several bad [behaviors endemic to the global arms
trade]{.underline}. [Three-quarters of all international arms transfers
go to countries that]{.underline}, according to Transparency
International, [score a "D" or worse in terms of anti-corruption
measures]{.underline} in their defense sectors. [Almost two-thirds of
American exports go to such countries]{.underline}, but compare this to
the other leading arms dealers. [France is 76 percent and the United
Kingdom is 85 percen]{.underline}t. **[Russia and China do not export to
any clients graded above a "D."]{.underline}** [An identical story
emerges when we look at exports to human rights abusers]{.underline}.
The U.S. military-industrial complex may appear to be a collection of
rent-seeking, war-profiteering, influence-peddling, threat-inflating
sociopaths until you look at nearly every other country's version.

The United States sells most of its weapons through its Foreign Military
Sales program, which essentially adds foreign orders onto preexisting
ones for U.S. forces. [Foreign Military Sales plays an unheralded role
in global anticorruption efforts, since clients pay the same price as
the U.S. military, and most of the contracting is handled by the
Department of Defense]{.underline}. Because the combined domestic and
international orders tend to be large, economies of scale also drive
down the cost for foreign clients, which makes for an attractive value
proposition, even with many American strings attached. [By contrast,
when dealing with less stringent regulations in other countries, buyers
are likely to encounter corruption --- side payments to "agents" and
bribes to officials]{.underline} --- which ensures the purchasing state
is not getting the best value for its money. This in turn undermines a
fundamental goal of U.S. arms transfers: enabling partners to provide
their own security and to potentially fight effectively alongside U.S.
forces. [Loosening American regulations to increase arms sales may not
only increase corruption levels, but also reduce the value of the
product bought by U.S. allies and partners, making their militaries less
capable]{.underline}.

Controlling the Spread of Dangerous Technology

[U.S. restraint also limits the spread of technology]{.underline},
[which dampens global arms races and slows the spread of dangerous
advanced weapons technology]{.underline}, which will eventually diffuse
to American adversaries. And of course, [it prevents the emergence of
competitors, which makes good economic sense]{.underline} as well.
Historically, the United States has practiced "unilateral restraint" by
foregoing exporting its highest-capability weapons to a region until a
viable competing product emerges; for example, refusing to deliver
advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles to Asian states until China
purchased the Russian equivalent R-77.

More broadly, [the United States, more than any other
exporter]{.underline}, jealously [guards against the spread of weapons
know-how]{.underline} even to its closest allies (often arms exporters
themselves). A case in point is Turkey's effort to acquire foreign
long-range air and anti-missile defense systems, hoping to acquire the
underlying technology and eventually become a major arms exporter
itself. The U.S.-made Patriot system was eliminated from consideration
because most of its technology would not be given to Turkey. Announcing
the ultimate deal with Russia, Turkey's presidential spokesman was
frank: "The price difference could have been manageable. But the issue
of technology transfer was more important. On this issue, our allies,
including the United States, caused a big disappointment." [The United
States, again **because of its market power**, can afford this restraint
in order to maintain its global technological dominance.]{.underline}

U.S. Influence Through Regulations and Economic Concessions

Another reason [the United States tends to be restrained in arms
sales]{.underline} is the accompanying "red tape," much of which the
Trump initiative will seek to remove. [U.S. regulations surpass those
suggested in the toothless U.N. Conventional Arms Trade Treaty, which
four of the most important market-makers --- Russia, China, India, and
Saudi Arabia --- have not bothered to even sign]{.underline}. [The
United States makes]{.underline} onerous [demands --- including on-site
inspections]{.underline} on sovereign territory --- [of importing states
to ensure weapons do not get transferred to third parties]{.underline},
[and require that these weapons only be employed for their intended
use]{.underline} (i.e. self-defense). While not always consistently
enforced, these requirements remain a powerful latent foreign policy
tool.

Contrary to what industry lobbyists might say, [this is not a source
competitive disadvantage. It is a sign of American market power and a
source of American influence]{.underline}. A Russian observer, writing
in a U.N. report, notes rather drily that the U.S. export control system
is both much more effective than any other country's and "frequently
used for influencing the end-user's foreign policy." [The United States
has used these rules to limit and shape proliferation,]{.underline} from
banning the sale of Israeli airborne early warning systems to China to
preventing the transfer of used light aircraft from Spain to Venezuela.
[It strictly regulates]{.underline}, when it wants to, [how these
weapons are used]{.underline} by the purchasing states themselves. Even
France, a longtime ally in counter-terror and major power in its own
right, needs to get U.S. approval before deploying its own Reapers. The
capability and value of the American product (as well as the continued
alignment of both countries' interests) are enough for France to swallow
its sovereign pride on this front.

[U.S. arms exports rely on a simple bargain: Clients join an
American]{.underline}-dominated global [supply chain]{.underline} in
return for better value weapons, larger orders of subcomponents from
local firms, and access to leading-edge weapons technology. [These
smaller states]{.underline}, in turn, [surrender]{.underline} to the
United States [large swathes of their foreign and defense
policies,]{.underline} including foregoing sales to regimes that
threaten U.S. interests. The process is characterized by hard bargaining
and by a considerable degree of coercion by the United States, such as
when it temporarily kicked Israel out of the Joint Strike Fighter
program for selling unmanned aerial vehicle parts to China.

Sovereign states are of course reluctant to hand over their foreign
policy, but [the United States can use financial incentives]{.underline}
(thereby reducing the economic benefit at home) [to convince countries
to buy American.]{.underline} Consider the formidable missile defense
complex the United States is trying to create in South Asia among
itself, Japan, and South Korea. Trump has suggested that, contrary to
current agreements, South Korea pay for the THAAD missile defense
system, at a billion dollars a battery, deployed in North Gyeongsang
province: "We're going to protect them. But they should pay for that,
and they understand that." But South Korea has already paid a heavy
price for deploying THAAD due to Chinese economic retaliation. And there
are massive security spillovers if South Korea continues to participate.
Japan and South Korea's participation in the Aegis system, for example,
pulls two states loath to cooperate with each other bilaterally into
something resembling a collective-security network. If economic
concessions on THAAD or a possible \$1.7 billion Aegis missile purchase
are necessary to bring South Korea into this network, that may be a
price worth paying.

TRUMP'S ARMS EXPORTS POLICY: DEBUNKING KEY ASSUMPTIONS SHIMON ARAD
SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 (Shimon Arad is a retired colonel of the Israeli
Defense Forces. His writings focus on Middle East regional security
topics.)
https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trumps-arms-exports-policy-debunking-key-assumptions/

The [desire to increase revenues from arms exports in the present
"buyers' market" is leading the Trump administration to
**consider**]{.underline} [the release of previously denied advanced
capabilities]{.underline} for export. [A prime example]{.underline} is
the administrations [push to redefine the categorization of unmanned
aerial aircrafts]{.underline} [to increase America's share of the global
market,]{.underline} that is expected to grow in worth from about \$6
billion in 2015 to \$12 billion in 2025. Easing previous restrictions,
the administration has also recently given permission to market armed
drones to India as well as to certain countries in Europe and the
Asia-Pacific. [The Trump administration is also reported to be
considering the sale of the F-35 to the Gulf states even though this has
been a denied capability given America's commitment to Israel's
qualitative military edge.]{.underline}

### Aerospace K2 Economy

The [competition for aerospace production work]{.underline} among US
states and regions **[is intensifying]{.underline}** for a simple
reason: **[The outlook for the aircraft industry is now the best it has
been for decades]{.underline}**. Topline [output continues at near
record levels]{.underline}. [Key segments look set for growth through
the next three years]{.underline}, at least. **[There are areas of
concern]{.underline}**, and not all manufacturers will benefit equally,
[but overall the industry is in excellent shape]{.underline}. World
industry output in 2017 came to just over \$180 billion. Deliveries in
2014-2016 have all been at about this level in constant 2018 dollars
(2015 was the all-time record, at \$183.5 billion). However, **[the
industry has been stuck on this plateau]{.underline}** not for market
reasons, but rather [for reasons relating to production ramp
difficulties]{.underline} with key new programs. Single aisle jetliners
represent 25% of the value of this industry, and difficulties in
transitioning between the last generation and the next generation have
resulted in the present level of stalled output. **[The F35 Joint Strike
Fighter's slow production ramp has contributed to this
problem.]{.underline}** But these numbers represent only the value of
deliveries; they exclude the broader footprint of the industry, which is
about two to three times as large as the value of total new build
aircraft. The numbers also exclude research and development funding, and
the generally more lucrative aftermarket sustainment business.
Therefore, since the new aircraft market is worth \$180-\$210 billion
per year, [we reckon that the total aircraft industry contributes
\$700-900 billion annually to the world economy]{.underline} (that
covers the broader industry footprint plus research and sustainment).
And **[this figure excludes numerous related industries,]{.underline}**
such as airlines, air traffic control, and military air base support
services. As the chart to the right indicates, for the past 15 years,
topline deliveries growth has come primarily from the civil markets,
with a 3.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by value. [Military
markets have grown at a 2% pace]{.underline}, but higher defense budgets
will grow this in the coming few years. As chart 2 below indicates, US
primes' share of this industry has remained relatively steady at just
above 50% by value of deliveries for the last two decades. As the
industry topline has grown, so has US output. While this chart measures
output solely at the prime level, US industry continues to do very well
at the subcontractor level, exceeding the 50% mark in most key segments
(engines, avionics, etc.) and equaling the 50% level in others
(aerostructures, control systems, etc.). The [primary drivers of US
industry]{.underline} at the prime level [include Boeing jetliners and
fighters]{.underline}, Lockheed Martin fighters, Gulfstream business
jets, and rotorcraft from all three primes (Boeing, Textron/Bell, and
Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky). Many other smaller manufacturers play a
supporting role. Given the relatively steady state nature of this
industry, where [there are few major disruptions]{.underline} and
product life cycles are measured in decades, it isn't surprising that
the US's aerospace trade surplus is relatively steady. As chart 3 below
indicates, [the US has enjoyed a roughly 2.5-1 aerospace trade
advantage]{.underline} by value with the rest of the world for decades.
This higher ratio of recorded exports (compared with 1-1 output at the
prime level, shown in the previous chart) reflects US industry's success
at the subcontractor level, along with success in space systems,
missiles, and in other markets.

#### Aerospace is key to the economy but the industry is vulnerable to shocks and competition

This traffic growth (and [industry health) far exceeds the pace of world
economic growth. **There's a long-established link between GDP and
traffic,**]{.underline} and traffic is now outperforming the usual GDP
multipliers by a healthy margin. It's hard to say whether this will
continue, but even if RPK growth falls to 2016's 6.3% level, that's
sufficient to keep jetliner demand strong. [While traffic is
outperforming economic growth, the latter is also]{.underline} quite
[strong.]{.underline} The U.S. economy has now been expanding for nine
straight years, with no signs of a slowdown. The IMF and OECD are both
forecasting global growth of 3.9% this year, up from 3.7% in 2017. [All
the major regions of the world are enjoying this growth]{.underline},
and China, again the biggest single market for jetliners, is still
growing at around 6.5%. **[There are many things that could go
wrong.]{.underline}** [In addition to a decline in passenger traffic and
economic growth, a trade war with China or a slowdown in China\'s
economy, and changes to the fuel prices/interest rates ratio, **there's
always the risk of an exogenous shock**,]{.underline} such as a war or a
terror attack. But [our baseline scenario calls for growth through
2020.]{.underline} At that point, jetliner industry output, in real
dollars, will be worth three times the level in 2004, when this
super-cycle began. **[The jetliner industry's remarkable growth is
accompanied by a strong military aircraft market]{.underline}**.
However, as the chart to the right indicates, [the US part of this
market is increasingly dominated by Lockheed Martin's F-35]{.underline}.
Also, there are even fewer new product launches in the military market
than there are in the civil markets. Despite its current good fortunes,
[Boeing faces]{.underline} a few [challenges in the future.]{.underline}
**[The military market outlook described above is clearly not in its
favor]{.underline}**. [It's one of the biggest curiosities that the
world's largest military aviation program is a US program, but the US's
biggest aerospace company is one of the very few companies in the world
without any kind of role in that program]{.underline} (the F-35).
Northrop Grumman has won the B-21 bomber contract. While the T-X trainer
is still up for grabs, there are three competitors, and even if Boeing
wins it would not provide much growth. Also, as discussed above, **[even
the current remarkable jetliner market will run out of growth in the
next few years.]{.underline}** Clearly, [if Boeing wants to keep growing
its revenue and profits, it will need to try new
approaches]{.underline}. [This explains why the company has established
a separate aftermarket division, to pursue sustainment
opportunities.]{.underline} [It also explains why the company is
establishing new capabilities]{.underline} in propulsion, actuation, and
avionics, to pursue vertical integration opportunities. But a third
approach will be to look at where the company is weakest against Airbus,
and to see what can be done to regain lost market share in that segment.
The New Midsize Airplane (NMA) is a response to that middle market
weakness.

#### Something about manufacturing sites 

**Aboulafia, Zoretich & Woods 18**

http://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Final-ACES-Report.pdf

[Boeing's]{.underline} need for an ironclad NMA [business case relies on
many factors on the supply side. Supplier costs, aftermarket rights, and
technology and materials decisions all play key roles]{.underline}. But
the **[economics associated with site selection will play a
role]{.underline}** too, [both for final assembly and any separate
fuselage or wing manufacturing location. An aerospace company's need to
looking at production site options]{.underline} as part of establishing
a business case for a new program [is a relatively recent development in
the jetliner industry.]{.underline} Historically, [most jetliners have
been built at legacy production sites]{.underline}. [Given very high
barriers to entry]{.underline} in this business, and given very long
product life cycles (the 737 last year set a record at 50 years in
production[), this is not surprising]{.underline}. This means a[ircraft
have been produced where successful companies were
established]{.underline} themselves, usually many decades ago.
Sometimes, these companies were established in places for relatively
arbitrary reasons, such as Boeing's original start in a wooden shipyard
in Seattle, and its utility for wooden seaplanes. Often, aerospace
companies were located in places far from an enemy threat, such as
Russia's Siberian-based aircraft factories, or almost all of France's
aerospace industry. Until the 1990s, this reliance on legacy
manufacturing sites didn't change very much. **[Successful companies
turned their legacy sites into industrial powerhouses]{.underline}**;
unsuccessful companies reduced their legacy sites to museums. In 2016,
the last C17 rolled off the line in Long Beach. This represented the
last jet built in California, the last of thousands of aircraft. Today,
state and regional competitiveness matters, but in the first decades of
the jet age success was determined by company success or failure and the
attributes of the sites themselves seldom played much of a role.
McDonnell Douglas failed as a jetliner prime not because Long Beach was
a terrible place to build planes; rather, it just systematically
underinvested in new technology and products. If Boeing had been located
in Long Beach, and McDonnell Douglas had been located in the Puget
Sound, it's quite likely that the fortunes of these two regions as
aerospace manufacturing centers would have been reversed. But Boeing
invested in the future, which helped create and maintain a skilled
workforce, and many other attributes that make the Puget Sound a great
place to build aircraft. While [manufacturers generally stayed in their
legacy regions]{.underline}, [two other trends had a material impact on
the evolution of aircraft production. The first was
outsourcing]{.underline}. While Boeing regrets going too far in
outsourcing design and integration work on the 787, the idea of
spreading production to risk-sharing partners has been around for half a
century, or longer. The entire body of the 747 was outsourced to
Northrop in the 1960s. Increasingly, this outsourcing went global,
largely as a result of much broader macroeconomic trends. As borders and
governments gave ground to multinational enterprises and economic
liberalization, international trade grew at a record pace. Container
boxes and ships, air cargo, CAD/CAM, the internet and logistical
software provided tools to accelerate globalization. Distance became
less relevant. Manufacturing became less vertical, creating global
supply chains and industrial arrangements. US manufacturers have been
transformed by this new paradigm, enjoying remarkable profitability over
the past few decades. Meanwhile, as noted above, Boeing is pursuing
vertical integration opportunities. In the case of the 777X wing, this
work will indeed be located near the final assembly line. But in the
case of other systems, most notably propulsion systems, the work will be
placed away from final production. For example, Boeing's propulsion unit
is building 737MAX engine nacelles in South Carolina, across the country
from Renton. It might be part of Boeing, yet it still represents
distributed manufacturing. The idea of a "supersite," where all
components and structures for a given aircraft are built in the same
region, is generally not regarded as a valid approach. [In good times,
such a supersite would see very high wage inflation for engineers and
manufacturing workers]{.underline}, with Boeing and its contractors all
poaching employees from each other. [And in a bust cycle, the region
would be hit hard by very high unemployment rates. The second aircraft
industry trend over the past few decades has been the establishment of
secondary final assembly lines]{.underline}, or, as they are sometimes
termed today, Final Assembly and Check Out (FACO) lines. [Military
programs have relied upon FACOs]{.underline} since before World War One.
But with its China facility constructed to build MD-80s, McDonnell
Douglas extended the concept to jetliners. Airbus has further led the
way in adapting this idea for jetliners. At first, the European company
used the concept to establish a secondary single aisle line, in Germany,
at a member company facility. But today, it has transplant lines in
Mobile, Alabama, and Tianjin, China. It will also use its Mobile
facility to build the CSeries in a secondary line when that acquisition
is completed. This second trend, of secondary assembly lines, was
enabled by the first trend. Basically, [with sections of the aircraft
built elsewhere, it became less expensive to establish secondary final
assembly lines,]{.underline} because they didn't need to have a heavy
level of local production. Inevitably, this led to a move away from
legacy sites for final assembly lines on new programs. One of the first
abortive instances of this took place on the MD-95, later designated the
Boeing 717. In November 1994 McDonnell Douglas announced that it had
signed up Dalfort Aviation, a Texas-based overhaul company, to handle
final assembly of the aircraft. However, this was later cancelled, and
the 717 was built at Long Beach. The 787 was the first Boeing aircraft
which involved a very active manufacturing site selection process. After
surveying numerous alternatives in the US, including South Carolina,
Texas, and Alabama, Boeing selected Everett, Washington in December
2003. However, Boeing later decided to establish a second production
line in Charleston, South Carolina. The 787 was followed by the 737MAX.
As a derivative rather than a clean-sheet design, the incumbent 737
production site had an advantage. Even though Boeing executives said
they would look at alternative sites, Boeing management worked with
labor and other parties, under Project Pegasus, to come to mutually
agreeable terms to keep the line in Washington. This was followed by the
777X site selection process, which also involved a derivative jet. While
this was a far more contentious process, which, in theory, involved a
much closer look at alternative sites, Boeing kept the line in Everett.
So far, Airbus has yet to look at alternatives to Toulouse and Hamburg
for its primary jetliner final assembly lines, and Embraer has not
looked outside of Sao Jose Dos Campos. However, Embraer has moved
business jet production lines to Florida. But Bombardier did investigate
alternatives to Mirabel for CSeries jetliner production, at the start of
the program. Boeing, of course, will continue its stated policy of
examining many alternatives for future jetliner programs. And to
summarize, the success of Boeing's NMA will depend on choosing the
optimal site, or sites, for manufacturing and final assembly. The
changing nature of aviation manufacturing means that this plane could be
built anywhere, but top states maintain competitive advantages outlined
in the ACES rankings below.

[We live in a **global era**]{.underline}---and the planet's
metropolitan areas lead this interconnected growth. The world's 200
largest [metropolitan economies account for]{.underline} just 14 percent
of world population, but generated over **[48 percent of
global]{.underline}** gross domestic product **[(GDP)]{.underline}** in
2011.8 These metro areas have emerged on every corner of the globe, from
the largest economies within developed countries to the fast-growing
metro areas in developing markets.9 Taken in concert, the success of
metropolitan economies throughout the developed and developing world
suggest that [the]{.underline} new global [economy is]{.underline} much
spikier and **[interconnected]{.underline}** than originally thought.10
In this global era, [U.S. metro]{.underline} areas [must]{.underline}
simultaneously [collaborate with **domestic** and **international**
peers]{.underline}. This is where [aviation plays a **critical
role**---it fosters]{.underline} the [inter-metropolitan connections
**critical** to]{.underline} future **[economic growth]{.underline}**.
These connections cross both the physical and personal spheres. Metro
areas such as New York and London are well connected through many
domestic and global partners, which enhances their competitive advantage
by offering their businesses greater access to global markets. Metro
areas such as Miami or Seattle may have relatively fewer relationships,
but nonetheless derive a competitive advantage as critical gateways to
the South and West.11 Lessons from Munich and its well-connected airport
hub further demonstrate the benefits from such connectivity.12
International [aviation]{.underline} puts people within reach of their
overseas family, [encourages tourism, and **empowers
businesses**]{.underline} with the opportunity for face-to-face
meetings.13 The global aviation network also [supports]{.underline} the
rise of new **[immigrant gateways]{.underline}** across the United
States, [forging]{.underline} even [strong]{.underline}er **[economic
and social connections]{.underline}** to world regions.14 The key point
is that [while a metro area may have a wealth of]{.underline} human and
economic [capital, they **cannot**]{.underline} fully **[exploit those
resources without]{.underline}** strategic **[global
linkages]{.underline}**. These aviation-related connections deliver real
benefits to local economies. Aviation's positive effect on [local
employment is a **major**]{.underline} economic
**[benefit]{.underline}**.15 Metro areas that serve as destinations for
large numbers of people are, implicitly, points of convergence for new
ideas and capital. These places have the right mix of human capital and
other resources to incubate new business ventures and to stimulate
creativity. The net effect is an employment [boost
throughout]{.underline} local industries, from **[high-skill
services]{.underline}** that rely heavily on air travel [to]{.underline}
more stationary industries like **[manufacturing]{.underline}**.16 The
economic effects of aviation are [so wide-ranging that they]{.underline}
hold potential for **[spillover]{.underline}** effects that benefit
other sectors and people. That is not to say local economic effects are
equal across all places. Airports specializing in throughtraffic, like
Atlanta, generate economic activity in sectors directly related to
transportation, but these effects may not always spillover into the
broader metro economy. In contrast, [cities that serve]{.underline}
primarily [as]{.underline} destination points or freight [hubs enjoy
**increased economic activity**]{.underline} more [**broadly**,
experiencing job growth even in **non-transportation
sectors**]{.underline}.17 Metro areas with predominantly
leisure-oriented flows see greater job growth in entertainment and
recreation industries, while job growth in places with predominantly
business-oriented flows comes from management and financial
occupations.18 International aviation also directly boosts the U.S.
economy by supporting travel and tourism since nearly all foreign
visitors from outside North America enter the country via air. These
visitors generated \$47 billion in real national output in 2011, an
increase of 57.7 percent from 2003.19 Overall, U.S. travel and tourism
exports grew by 6.1 percent from 2009 to 2011, supported in large part
by international visitors.20 Despite these benefits, certain [market
inefficiencies **limit** aviation's]{.underline} total [economic impact.
One example is when a]{.underline} nonstop [flight between
two]{.underline} metro [areas does not exist even though large
numbers]{.underline} of passengers [travel between them]{.underline}.
Supply and demand [mismatches introduce **inefficiencies**]{.underline}
into the aviation system, forcing passengers to "fly where they don't
want to go," such as the many international travelers that simply pass
through Charlotte's Douglas International Airport.21 These systemic
mismatches [make]{.underline} certain metropolitan [areas]{.underline}
harder and [**costlier to reach**, and]{.underline} could [**stifle**
their]{.underline} aviation-related **[economic growth]{.underline}**.
This may present relatively few challenges for U.S. businesses primarily
operating in U.S. cities, where routes are some of the most time- and
costefficient in the world.22 But [it is a **big**]{.underline}ger
[**problem** for U.S.-]{.underline}based [businesses seeking to **expand
into**]{.underline} South American or African [**markets**, where cities
may be **more**]{.underline} costly and **[time consuming to
reach]{.underline}**. Thus, [the organization of international
aviation]{.underline} service **[directly shapes U.S. businesses
opportunities for global expansion]{.underline}** and partnering.23

#### Investments key to aerospace industry growth

**Starr & Jones 18**

Aerospace and Defense Trends 2018-19 By Randy Starr, Larry Jones
strategy& https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/trend/2018-defense

[To keep pace with new entrants, companies must focus on
innovation]{.underline}.

In 2017, examining the dynamics of the aerospace and defense (A&D)
sector, we emphasized the need for global companies to focus on building
relationships with defense agencies around the world. We said they
should seek entrées into new lucrative markets even as their U.S. and
E.U. business remains flat.

That assessment is still pertinent in 2018, even in the face of expanded
U.S. defense budgets. There are many uncertainties surrounding how that
money will be spent. For example, will the Pentagon return to the days
of traditional long-term weapons development programs? Or will it take
the more likely course of pursuing new partners --- either legacy
players or nontraditional entrants --- that can invest in creative
technology solutions and deliver them faster and cheaper? Another
uncertainty involves the European Ministers of Defense, who are joining
together as a bloc to increase investments in military equipment.
Digitizing the armed forces and lowering procurement expenditures on big
ticket items are priorities for them. Will this change leave A&D
companies following traditional paths of product development out in the
cold?

2018 Aerospace and Defense Trends

Investment & Innovation

New R&D rivals

A global strategy built upon their own innovation and capabilities is
the most viable path for most companies in this industry. But is that
feasible? For some time now, defense contracting has been among the most
risk-averse sectors, often opting to return capital to shareholders via
share buybacks and dividend payouts, leaving research and development
wanting. Indeed, in absolute numbers, the global A&D industry spends
much less on research and development than other critical sectors. In
terms of innovation intensity (the percentage of sales earmarked for
R&D), its spending is also comparatively low --- just 4.1 percent. (In
Europe, it's a bit higher, at 5.1 percent; in the U.S., it's 3.6
percent.) To be sure, these aerospace and defense R&D budgets are on par
with those of the auto industry when viewed as a percentage of sales,
but they greatly trail expenditures made by technologically intensive
companies, which have begun to enter this sector.

Slow-walking R&D efforts has never been a recipe for long-term success,
and some of the significant threats confronting the A&D industry show
why that's even more true in 2018. Commercial technology entrants have
large and growing workforces dedicated to developing new technologies
and can innovate rapidly.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan, a 30-year veteran of
Boeing, has spoken about the potential technology-deficit that defense
companies must address. They may have once ruled the military equipment
landscape and even led in innovation but that doesn't insulate them from
hungrier, more determined competitors. SpaceX, founded in 2002,
exemplifies this group. Elon Musk's company designs, manufactures, and
launches advanced rockets, covering a range of activities that in the
past could have been shared by a variety of defense contractors. And in
its short life, SpaceX has already proven its ability to disrupt the
defense business with a breakthrough that allows it to recover and reuse
booster sections.

And while Western A&D companies battle new entrants at home, countries
in other regions are expanding their defense capabilities and
industries, hoping to erode the technological edge that legacy Western
companies and countries have historically enjoyed. Some of them may
become formidable rivals. Recent reports indicate that China is making a
big push to develop military artificial intelligence technologies, and
China and Russia are developing sophisticated air-to-air missile systems
that use advanced imagery and sensors to thwart enemy intrusions before
they pierce the skies.

Accept uncertainty as part of the normal course of business; view it as
an opportunity, not a danger.

LinkedIn

As a result of these pressures, executives at large A&D companies must
confront a critical imperative: change how you make decisions about
capital expenditures and R&D spending to increase support for new
technologies and partnerships with the goal of designing and engineering
new products more quickly. In other words, adopt a more rigorous and
less risk-averse approach to evaluating and making strategic investment
choices (for example, product development, technology innovation, and
R&D) that yield long-term value. Accept uncertainty as part of the
normal course of business; view it as an opportunity, not a danger. At
the same time, collaborate with defense customers to tap into technology
innovation outside the A&D industry and adapt it to future platforms
rather than developing bespoke solutions.

We have already begun to see some movement in this direction, though not
enough. Some U.S. A&D companies are using a sudden influx of free cash
from massive tax cuts to widen R&D spending and investments in other
capital assets (although many are still designating much of the windfall
for shareholder payoffs that do little for future product development).
For instance, in 2018, Northrop Grumman plans to increase capital
expenditures by 11 percent and Raytheon says it is upping capital
spending by 50 percent. Lockheed Martin says it intends to invest in new
weapons development, while not providing any dollar figures. But these
announcement are relatively few, limited to American companies and don't
specify how much, if any, of the increased spending will go directly to
R&D, as opposed to other typical capital investments.

In addition, some defense outfits have developed unorthodox innovation
strategies to jumpstart new programs that formerly would not have been
in their wheelhouse. The U.S.-based Sierra Nevada Corporation teamed up
with Brazil's Embraer Defense & Security to retrofit Embraer's battle
hardened A-29 light attack aircraft for the U.S. Air Force and other air
forces worldwide. This contract grew out of a USAF effort to procure
equipment with minimal and more rapid development work than
traditionally required. Airbus has launched a new digital program called
Quantum, which among other things seeks to create new business models
around advanced technology. One of Airbus' initial Quantum efforts is
the development of highly complex commercial drones to buttress its
military unmanned device product lines.

Other A&D companies are explicitly trying to establish themselves as
digital leaders through M&A or partnerships. Thales has acquired
Dutch-based Gemalto for more than US\$5 billion, a deal that cements
Thales' new strategic vision in this sphere. Gemalto is a major player
in cybersecurity products, and Thales has been on a buying binge
recently to open up new revenue streams from technology. Boeing Defense,
Space & Security has joined with Saab Group to build a production
aircraft that provides the U.S. Air Force with a new, advanced pilot
training system that could replace the T-38 in the Air Force's T-X
training program. The project is notable in that Boeing broke a norm by
investing its own resources in R&D.

Some companies, such as Lockheed Martin (LM) are using venture funds to
focus their long-term, strategic investments on technology innovation.
LM's fund invests in early-stage technology companies that are involved
in autonomous systems and robotics, cybersecurity, artificial
intelligence, advanced electronics, and sensor technologies.

No A&D company can avoid the need to be much more nimble and
forward-thinking than they've been in the past. Companies must determine
how to allocate capital to build differentiating capabilities, address
current and future customer needs, help customers innovate, and, of
course, maximize shareholder returns.

How can they develop an investment strategy to meet these goals? A good
starting point is a more disciplined approach to valuing strategic
options. This involves analyzing specific financial indicators (such as
cash flows or intrinsic value) generated by the company's current
strategy, versus other strategic options. The cash flow can then be used
to develop advanced products, instead of simply returning capital to
shareholders. A&D companies should ensure that their approach to
strategic investment decisions incorporates the following elements:

A disciplined approach to managing capital investments as a portfolio of
options, based on returns and on the drivers of intrinsic value. This
includes a dynamic valuation of strategic options and trade-offs
(potentially incorporating decision-tree analysis, what-if scenarios,
and an analysis of real option value in a range of plausible future
environments).

Agility in the face of market uncertainty through a dynamic strategy
process that is not constrained by annual financial-planning cycles.

Reducing expenses by ruthlessly focusing on the assets, markets,
business portfolio, technology, and core capabilities that provide the
company's competitive advantage. (We call this a fit-for-growth
program.) Too often, R&D funds are allocated to business units, letting
them decide what to do with the money, rather than earmarked to fund
specific priorities.

Incentive and compensation programs that reward executives for
investment decisions that result in successful innovation and improved
competitive advantage. The traditional approach of offering bonuses for
meeting annual performance objectives --- equity returns, earnings, and
the like --- is counterproductive because executives can achieve these
goals while actually destroying value in the company by, for instance,
seeking savings through cutbacks in R&D.

Changes in the corporate culture. The average defense contractor's
workforce is skewed to a middle-aged demographic that is strong in
developing and maintaining proprietary systems, but does not have the
tech aptitude that increasingly drives weapons equipment efforts and
advances today.

In those areas where commercial industries --- particularly technology
companies --- may be several years ahead, defense contractors shouldn't
try to catch up on their own. They must realize that the government will
purchase commercial products that are not proprietary in order to take
advantage of their potential applications more quickly. To address this,
defense contractors should partner with startups to adopt new
technologies the A&D companies need. Acquisitions and venture
capital--style investments are also possible in this realm. Boeing,
Airbus, LM, and Raytheon have all bought interests in high-tech firms,
working in areas that include cybersecurity, integrated circuits,
drones, small electric airplanes, and augmented reality.

Newstimes Defense, aerospace continue to be keys to state's economy By
Chris Bosak Published 12:00 am EDT, Sunday, September 30, 2018

The defense and aerospace industries may be the key to leading
Connecticut out of its job-growth doldrums, according to a Fitch Ratings
review of the 2019 Defense Authorization Act.

The 2019 defense budget includes several billion dollars for projects
that will impact Connecticut, including \$10.6 billion to purchase 77
F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney, a
subsidiary of United Technologies, is part of the partnership that makes
the fighters.

The authorizations also include billion-dollar projects for Sikorsky and
Electric Boat. Stratford-based Sikorsky is a subsidiary of Lockheed
Martin and Electric Boat of Groton is a subsidiary of General Dynamics.

"Connecticut is such an integral part of defense, for the Navy's plans
in particular," said Nicholas Varone, Fitch's associate director for
corporate ratings in U.S. aerospace and defense. "It's an important
state when we talk about defense spending."

A report by the Connecticut Institute for the 21st Century backs up
Fitch Rating's conclusions. "The Future of Defense Workforce: How Can
Connecticut Promote Growth and Retention?" details the strength of the
defense industry in the state and the ambitious hiring plans by the
large companies. Loren Dealy Mahler, a Milford resident and senior
fellow with the Institute, prepared the report.

Electric Boat plans to expand its workforce in Connecticut from 11,000
to 18,000 by 2030. The Navy has hinted at increasing the numbers of
ships and submarines it will order.

"The nuclear submarine will be a focal point of the Navy for a number of
years," Varone said. "At least as far as we can see on the horizon."

Pratt & Whitney, according to the report, expects to double production
by 2020 and again by 2027. It plans to hire 8,000 workers in the next 10
years.

The good news about the defense authorizations go well beyond the big
corporations in the state. Smaller manufacturers sprinkled throughout
the state make up much of the supply chain for the large companies.
Pratt & Whitney, according to the report, gets 85 percent of its engine
parts from outside suppliers. Electric Boat has about 450 suppliers in
the state and doled out \$485 million in contracts to Connecticut
manufacturers in the last five years.

"The supply base is strong in Connecticut with a significant number of
suppliers to support defense," David Petu, Fitch's director of corporate
ratings for U.S. aerospace and defense, said.

Finding the workers

Many manufacturers across the state are finding out that it's one thing
to need to hire employees, but something else to find skilled workers to
fill those positions. An aging workforce and lingering perceptions about
manufacturing jobs being dirty, low-paid and low-skilled have created a
shortfall of workers for the industry.

"That's a concern for the industry as a whole and in Connecticut," Petu
said.

The state has addressed the situation by creating programs in community
colleges and high schools that train workers for advanced manufacturing
jobs. The programs have proven to be highly successful for the companies
looking for workers and the trainees seeking employment.

Joseph DeFeo, director of the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center
at Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury, said students have a
100 percent placement rate since the center was created in 2012.

"Manufacturing is hot throughout the state and country," he said a
recent manufacturers roundtable held in Danbury. "There are probably
more jobs than people to fill them. There are a lot of positions, but
people need the right skills. At least at this point, you're guaranteed
a job coming from our program."

Connecticut is known to have a highly educated and skilled workforce,
but when it comes to manufacturing, the skills often do not match up.
The state cannot afford a skills gap as it continues to lag behind the
region and country in terms of job recovery from the recession, analysts
say.

Connecticut has recovered only 88.5 percent of the jobs lost during the
recession that started in 2008, according to the state's Department of
Labor. Much of that is due to governmental cutbacks as the state's
private sector has regained 113 percent of the jobs lost, but that still
lags well behind that of the region and the U.S.

Connecticut has seen four consecutive months of job gains and the
defense industry may play a major role in continuing that momentum.
Dealy Mahler, in her defense workforce report, suggested the state
increase its support of college and high school training programs and
increase the number of manufacturing instructors to include retired or
soon-to-retire workers.

The state recognizes the importance of the defense industry and has
provided millions of dollars in incentives for the large companies to
stay in Connecticut. In September 2016, the state gave Sikorsky \$220
million in incentives to keep the helicopter manufacturer in Stratford.
In 2014, the state provided \$400 million in state tax offsets to United
Technology to keep Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. Also in 2014,
Electric Boat received a \$10 million loan to expand its facility.

Now boarding

The commercial aerospace industry is jetting along as well, and
Connecticut is reaping benefits. Pratt & Whitney makes engines for the
Airbus A320 and that craft is facing a large backlog and increased
production.

Petu said the commercial aerospace industry is expected to remain
strong, barring a global recession that reduces demand for air travel.

"You can't discount the health of commercial aerospace --- that's a huge
part of it," he said. "Commercial aviation is very healthy. Aerospace is
more cyclical than defense, but it is at its height of backlog and
production. We don't expect that to change in the near term."

[The report estimates the economic contribution of the civil aviation
industry to the U.S. economy. Civil aviation has far-reaching economic
impacts.]{.underline} While some of these impacts cannot be measured
quantitatively, this report captures economic activity generated by
direct and indirect air transport of passengers and cargo using the best
data available from government and private sources. Methodology [[The
total economic impact of an industry is a summation of primary impacts
and induced impacts of spending on that particular
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. This definition is standard for
economic-impact studies and is used to estimate aviation's unique
economic contribution to the national economy. The data used to measure
the primary economic impacts of civil aviation were collected from
reliable government and private sources. This study estimated those
impacts by looking at industry output, earnings, and jobs. These data
were entered into the RIMS II Input-Output Model, a model developed by
the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, to derive
the secondary economic impacts of spending. Primary and secondary
impacts were then summed to produce a measure of civil aviation's total
impact on the U.S. economy. Types of Economic Impacts Primary Impacts:
[[The primary impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} of aviation [are a summation
of direct and indirect impacts of civil aviation on the U.S. economy and
[include]{.mark}:]{.underline} • [[Air transportation and supporting
services]{.underline}]{.mark} • [[Aircraft]{.underline}]{.mark},
aircraft engines, and [[parts manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark} •
[[Travel]{.underline}]{.mark} and other trip-related
[[expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark} by travelers using air
transportation Induced or Secondary Impacts: [[Induced
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} result [[from expenditures made by
industries identified in the measurement of primary
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} to supporting businesses and entities, [[as
well as the spending of direct and indirect
employees.]{.underline}]{.mark} Induced impacts capture the secondary
impacts to the economy as direct/indirect sales, and payroll impacts are
circulated to supporting industries through multiplier effects.Primary
expenditure estimates are input into the RIMS II model to estimate the
secondary effects of those expenditures on the U.S. economy. The output
of the RIMS II model includes the secondary effects on economic output,
earnings, and jobs. Output: The total economic value of goods and
services produced.29 Earnings: Wages and salaries, other labor income,
benefits, and proprietors' income paid to all employed persons who
deliver final demand output and services. Jobs: The number of people
employed in the industry that provide civil-aviation services,
manufacture aircraft and aircraft engines, or work in other industries
that are indirectly affected by activity in the civil air transportation
sectorPrimary output is used to estimate the secondary effects of
spending in the economy. Primary output estimates are input into the
RIMS II model to calculate the secondary or induced impacts. Total
output, or the sum of primary and secondary impacts, is reported in
Table 4, which shows the following: • [[In 2014,]{.underline}]{.mark}
commercial aviation accounted for the bulk of civil aviation's economic
contribution, with [[airline operations generating \$325 billion in
total output]{.underline}]{.mark} • As domestic and foreign airline
[[passengers]{.underline}]{.mark} to the U.S. reach their destinations,
their total [[expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark} on hotels, rental cars,
and entertainment [[contributed \$771 billion]{.underline}]{.mark} in
total output, nearly double the output supported by airlines operations
• [[Total GA accounted for nearly \$80 billion of total output in
2014.]{.underline}]{.mark} While the impact is less than commercial
aviation, the GA contribution continues to reflect the industry's unique
role in the nation's transportation system. GA operations contributed
\$39 billion to total output. In August 2013, the Bureau of Economic
Analysis released its comprehensive revision estimates of U.S. GDP data
with several notable changes. One notable change that affected the
definition of GDP is the new inclusion of research and development (R&D)
expenditures as investment --- now part of GDP, rather than as
intermediate inputs-- previously not counted in GDP. This new treatment
increased the level of GDP. Starting with this year's report, R&D is
included in the calculation of aviation's contribution to GDP and is
consistent with measures of overall GDP from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. Including R&D, U.S. current-dollar GDP was \$17,393 billion in
2014.30 GDP represents the sum of all value-added activities in an
economy, so intermediate goods and services used in the production of
goods and services are not included. In the previous section, total
output calculation included intermediate goods and services that were
purchased as part of the production process. In order to compare
aviation's contribution to GDP, these intermediate goods and services
must be subtracted from the total output. In order to estimate civil
aviation's contribution to GDP, each impact type is calculated
separately using the RIMS II valueadded coefficients. The results are
shown in Table 5. [[In 2014, aviation-related value-added economic
activities totaled \$887 billion, or 5.1 percent of U.S.
GDP.]{.underline}]{.mark} In 2014, [[commercial aviation contributed
\$846 billion or 4.9 percent to GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}. Within
commercial aviation, the largest component is commercial visitor
expenditures totaling \$451 billion, or 2.6 percent of GDP (Table 5),
followed by airline operations at \$161 billion, or 0.9 percent of GDP.
General aviation, while small in comparison to commercial aviation,
still contributed 0.2 percent to GDP, or nearly \$41 billion. See the
Appendix for civil aviation's contribution to GDP for the years 2012
through 2014. [[The U.S. economy continues to grow since the previous
release of this repor]{.underline}]{.mark}t. From 2012 to 2014, real GDP
averaged 2.0 percent growth per year, to \$17.4 trillion. Employment
grew by over 4 million persons, from 143.3 million to 147.4 million.
[[Meanwhile, the civil aviation industry continues its
growth.]{.mark}]{.underline} In 2014, civil aviation accounted for 5.1
percent of the U.S. economy. The total output of civil aviation-related
goods and services amounted to \$1.6 trillion and generated 10.6 million
jobs, with earnings of \$447 billion. By contrast, civil aviation
contributed 5.0 percent to the economy in 2012, along with 9.7 million
jobs and earnings of \$405 billion. This report also updates the range
of detailed estimates which make up these industry totals. Along with
updates to the industry data, this report includes five new features as
well. The first is a summary of a recent FAA air transportation economic
productivity study. This study, a stand-alone work and not part of the
main set of report estimates, finds that **[[air transportation is a
major contributor to overall U.S. economic
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Among the 63 industries that make up
the U.S. economy, air transportation is ranked 41st]{.mark} in terms of
output, **[but is the 7th leading contributor to U.S. economic
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The second and third new features, which
form part of the main set of report estimates, are aviation research and
development (R&D) and avionics equipment manufacturing. Results for 2014
show the current dollar output of aviation R&D and avionics
manufacturing amounted to about \$10.6 billion and \$9.2 billion,
respectively. The fourth and fifth new features, not yet included in the
main set of estimates, are unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or drones) and
commercial space launches. UAS results for 2014 are not yet available
because drone use was not yet high enough to be identified in the source
data. The FAA will monitor drones as their popularity grows. The
economic impact of commercial space launches extends beyond this
industry. The commercial space industry launches satellites that belong
to companies in other industries and to governments, thereby influencing
other parts of the economy. In the future, the commercial space industry
aims to send tourists into space as well. The FAA will continue to
monitor the commercial space data and may include it in future
publications of this report.

Table 1 provides the results from the state-level analysis. There are
three sets of variables of interest: industrialization, democracy, and
capitalism. We note, first, that all three are correctly signed across
the four models. Democracy, though correctly signed, attains statistical
significance (p \< .10) in only one model. By contrast, both [capitalism
and industrialization show **robust effects on the likelihood of
conflict**]{.underline} [across our models.]{.underline}
Industrialization does fail to reach significance when capital openness
is included; however, the magnitude of the coefficient is consistent
with the other models. Standard errors are larger, given the reduced
time frame and number of observations.16 We also see a significant and
negative result for the service sector, suggesting that, at the monadic
level, shifts away from an agricultural economy generally reduce the
probability of fatal conflict onset. Our results provide substantial
support for our hypothesis, indicating that **[[the modernization of a
state's economy is associated with peaceful
behavior.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In addition to the statistical results,
it is useful to examine substantive effects. After all, statistical
inference is a function of precision as well as importance. Thus, it is
appropriate to look at the estimated effects of changes in
industrialization, democracy, and the three capitalism variables, across
our four models. Figure 1 displays the predicted probability of fatal
conflict onset, as each of the variables change from their (empirical)
minimum to maximum values. The lines provide predicted values, while the
shaded regions give 95 percent confidence intervals. In each case, we
use Hanmer and Kalkan's (2013) method for calculating average variable
effects.17 [Across each of the models, [we see a **clear decrease in the
likelihood of conflict**]{.mark}, **[as the level of industrialization
rises.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In each of the four models]{.underline}, [the estimated probability of
conflict, with no industrial sector is around 0.1 to 0.15.]{.underline}
[The **strong substantive effect** of industrialization holds even in
the capital openness model, where the variable failed to attain
statistical significance.]{.underline} **[[Capitalism shows similar
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as we vary each of the indicators across
its respective empirical range, though the effect is not quite as strong
as that of industrialization.18 By contrast, the slope for democracy is
relatively flat in each case, indicating especially small effects.

Our analysis at the monadic level provides significant support for our
first hypothesis, and gives us confidence in the workings of our theory.
It suggests that **[[industrialization can play a key role in
international relations.]{.underline}]{.mark}** However, the democratic
and capitalist peace theories are generally dyadic in nature. If our
mechanism is at play on the international stage, then our results should
be robust to a dyadic level of analysis, if we operationalize the
variable appropriately.

Table 2 displays the results from our dyadic analysis. Unsurprisingly,
dyadic democracy fares better than monadic democracy. It is correctly
signed across the four models, reaching significance in all but one.
With respect to the capitalism variables, only one of the
three---capital openness---attains significance at conventional levels
(p≈ .096), though all are signed correctly.
[Industrialization]{.underline}, meanwhile, is correctly signed and
[attains significance in all four models.]{.underline} This supports
Hypothesis 2 and provides us with greater confidence in our theory, as
it demonstrates that [industrialization operates at both the monadic and
dyadic levels]{.underline}.19 [Our statistical results suggest
that]{.underline} **[[industrialization has a clear and robust effect on
the likelihood of fatal conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We see fairly
consistent effects for democracy and little to no effect for capitalism.
It is important, however, to examine not only the direction and
precision of our estimates but also their substantive magnitudes. We
turn now to an analysis of the substantive results of Table 2.

The dyad-level substantive results are depicted in Figure 2.20 A caveat
to the substantive picture at the dyadic level is that we have
relatively low probabilities and large confidence intervals. There is
significant overlap across the three variables; however, we find
relatively flat effects for both democracy and capitalism, with stronger
effects for industrialization. [**[For]{.mark} especially [high values
of industrialization]{.mark}**, **[we see near-zero predicted
probabilities of conflict.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [This is consistent
with the powerful effect of modernization theorized above.]{.underline}

Both the statistical and substantive results provide support for our
hypotheses, demonstrating the impact that industrialization can have on
the likelihood of fatal conflict onset. For democracy and capitalism,
our results are split: only capitalism seems to affect the probability
of war at the monadic level, whereas democracy plays a larger role at
the dyadic level. [[Industrialization]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile,
[[has a robust **dampening effect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [at both levels
of analysis, **[even when we control for various measures of
liberalism.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Taken together, this suggests that
economic structure plays a critical role in explaining the conflict
behavior of states.

Conclusion

This paper began by proposing an explanation for the decline of war,
rooted in the writings of Joseph Schumpeter. We argued that
modernization can have a pacifying effect upon a state's foreign policy,
providing an initial exploration of this concept, using
industrialization to proxy for modernity. Our analysis demonstrates that
this argument is consistent with the historical record. [Over the period
analyzed here]{.underline}, [states with higher levels of
industrialization were less likely to become involved in **fatal
militarized disputes** than were their less heavily industrialized
counterparts.]{.underline} These results suggest that [the "conquest
pays" argument]{.underline} (applied to industrialized societies) [does
not hold]{.underline}, at least over the last fifty years. More
importantly, [our hypotheses are borne out at both the monadic and
dyadic levels, even when controlling for political and financial
liberalism]{.underline}. [This suggests that industrialization has an
effect **independent of liberalism**]{.underline} (in both its
democratic and capitalist variants), [and may explain recent shifts to
more peaceful foreign policy by authoritarian powers, such as
China]{.underline} (see Kurlantzick 2007). [Furthermore, unlike
democratization, from which it is easy to backslide into
authoritarianism]{.underline} (as has occurred repeatedly throughout
Pakistan's history, for example), [states that have industrialized tend
not to revert to pre-modern, agrarian societies]{.underline} (see
Huntington 1971, 290).

Although our results are robust, they come with some important caveats.
First, our Schumpeterian argument is not that development will lead
inevitably to a complete cessation of international conflict. Rather,
[the shift to industrialization produces both **material** and
**immaterial changes that**]{.underline}, in turn, **[reduce the
incentive to wage war.]{.underline}** [From a material point of view,
[the spread of industrialization]{.mark}---especially high-tech,
knowledge-based industrialization---[has rendered war
unprofitable]{.mark} in more general, rational terms. From an ideational
point of view, [the permanent shift to a more modern
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Schumpeter, [[brings a
persistent change in **attitudes toward war.**]{.underline}]{.mark} What
is important is that culture does not adjust immediately to the new
socioeconomic environment. Atavistic ideologies---reflecting the old
agrarian structure---can remain powerful factors that fan the flames of
conflict, even within relatively modern societies. Nonetheless,
modernization should reduce the prevalence of conflict, and given that
nearly every state on earth has at least begun the process in the last
half century (Inglehart 1997, 18), the decline of war would not have
surprised Schumpeter.

Although examining the causes of the two world wars is beyond the scope
of this paper, [[the lack of peace in]{.mark} early twentieth-century
[Europe initially seems puzzling]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[However]{.mark}, we suspect that [nationalist ideologies that pushed
countries to arms]{.mark} in the Great War, and especially the Axis
Powers and Bolshevik Russia in the Second World War, [can be
characterized]{.mark} precisely [as **atavistic remnants of a
pre-industrial past**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Taylor 1951, 550).21 In his
discussion of the rise of modernity, Raymond [Aron shares this view,
claiming that industrialization can explain the course]{.underline}
(i.e., destructiveness) [and results of "the Thirty Years'
War"]{.underline} (1914--1945), [but not its causes]{.underline} (Aron
2009, 471).

[concludes that 'the longer-term consequences are likely to be grim, not
least for his angry, but fooled, supporters]{.underline}. [Next time,
they might be even angrier. Where that might lead is
terrifying']{.underline}. Gillian Tett has also highlighted the 'real
risks' that [Trump's policies could 'spark]{.underline} [**US social
unrest** or **geopolitical uncertainty'**]{.underline}. Elsewhere,
George Monbiot in the Guardian, makes the stark assertion that [[the
inability of the US]{.underline}]{.mark} and other governments [[to
respond effectively to public anger means he]{.mark} now
[believes]{.mark} that]{.underline} '[[we will see]{.underline} **[war
between the major powers]{.underline}**]{.mark} within my lifetime'.

If these warnings weren't troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry
Kissinger argued on BBC's Newsnight that 'the more likely reaction' to a
Trump presidency from terror groups 'will be to do something that evokes
a reaction' from Washington in order to 'widen the split' between it and
Europe and damage the US's image around the world. Given that Trump has
already vowed to 'bomb the shit out of ISIS' and refused to rule out the
use of nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying that
such a scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be avoided
so that the US does not play into the terrorists' hands.

Looking more widely, President-elect Trump's existing and potential
cabinet appointments, which Glenn Greenwald has summarised as
'empowering...by and large...the traditional, hard, hawkish right-wing
members of the Republican Party' also point to the US engaging in future
overseas conflicts, rather than the isolationism which many in the
foreign policy establishment criticised Trump for proposing during the
presidential campaign. William Hartung and Todd Harrison have drawn
attention to the fact that defence spending under Trump could be almost
\$1trillion (spread over ten years) more than Obama's most recent budget
request. Such projections, alongside Trump's election rhetoric, suggest
that the new nuclear monarch will try to push wide open the door to more
spending on nuclear weapons and missile defense, a situation made
possible, as we have seen, by Obama's inability to implement progressive
change in this area at a time of persistent Republican obstruction.

Conclusion

The problem now, for the US and the world, is that if
[Trump]{.underline} does make good on his campaign promises then this
[will have several damaging consequences for international peace and
security]{.underline} [and]{.underline} that [if Trump does not
sufficiently satisfy his supporters]{.underline} [then this will likely
pour fuel on the flames at home]{.underline}, [which may
then]{.underline} **[quickly spread abroad]{.underline}**. The people of
the US and the world thus now have a huge responsibility to act as a
restraining influence and ensure that the US retains an accountable,
transparent and democratic government. This responsibility will only
grow [[if]{.underline} [**crises or shocks take place**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} or outside [[the US]{.underline}
[which]{.underline}]{.mark} [ambitious and]{.underline} **[[extremist
figures take advantage of]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [framing them as
threats to national security in order to protect their interests and
power]{.underline}. [If such scenarios emerge [the]{.mark} next
administration]{.underline} and its untried and untested
[[President]{.underline} [will find]{.underline}]{.mark} [themselves
with]{.underline} a range of extremely powerful tools and institutional
experience at their disposal, including [**[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, [which may prove]{.underline} **[too tempting to
resist]{.underline}**]{.mark} [when figuring out how to respond to
widespread anger, confusion and unrest]{.underline}, both [at
home]{.underline} and abroad.

Iran," Politics & Policy, Volume 41, No. 5)

Diversionary Nuclear Strategies on an Escalation-Ladder

Analyses typically detach causes from the consequences of proliferation,
separating the considerations for obtaining nuclear weapons from their
strategic and operational deployment. [Nuclear diversion theory
shows]{.underline} that [the reason for developing nuclear capacity can
be linked to **whether and how the regime might use it**]{.underline}.
This proposition highlights the need to envisage the actual diversionary
strategies a regime might employ when undergoing a domestic legitimacy
crisis. Since [regimes are purposeful actors, the possible strategies
might prospectively shape the motivation to go nuclear and the ways to
go about it]{.underline}. How then could an authoritarian / totalitarian
regime address its eroding legitimacy, and what role might nuclear
diversion play?

Drawing on Weber's typology legitimation, we may presume that when a
regime loses its legitimacy of one type or another, three measures might
offer remedy: (1) rebuilding the frail legitimacy; (2) constructing
other types of legitimacy; (3) sustaining political stability through
coercive mechanisms. A leadership in domestic distress may or may not
try these potential remedies via diversion. It stands to reason that the
more concerned the leaders are about their own survival, the more acute
is the legitimacy crisis; and the more feasible, safe and promising the
diversion, the more willing will be the leaders to divert. To reiterate,
in establishing why and how leaders divert (not whether they succeed),
what matters is the leaders' perceptions of these parameters, not some
neutral assessment. For example, as the deposed and deceased Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi faced mounting domestic dissension, he quickly
resorted to diversionary rhetoric: "Bin Laden\... this is the enemy who
is manipulating people" (BBC News Africa, 2011), but to no avail.

Diversion does not require a nuclear program. However, [[nuclear
diversion offers]{.mark} **[discrete benefits]{.mark}** and
**strategies**]{.underline}, [over and beyond the structural benefits
discussed above]{.underline}. [[When the]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[flag]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[to rally around bears the]{.mark}
**[nuclear emblem]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[sentiments]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[ideas]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[calculations
transmute]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This is especially true if the regime
effectively consecrates the nuclear project]{.underline}, [rendering it
an article of faith in the state's civil religion]{.underline}
(Santiago, 2009), thereby [[conferring]{.underline}
[inviolability]{.underline}]{.mark} (a Weberian charisma) [[upon]{.mark}
the [leadership]{.mark} in charge of the project and **delegitimating
its opposition**]{.underline}.

At the heart of the presumed linkage between patriotism and support for
leadership lies the identification of the flag with its current carrier
and the belief that rallying around the former bestows public support
upon the latter---as if by ousting the flag-carrier, the flag will
inevitably fall, and with it the nation as a whole. Note again, however,
that [what matters is not whether patriotism]{.underline}---even if
engendered by nuclear diversion---[would confer public
support]{.underline} on the leadership; in fact, [the linkage between
the two is far from self-evident]{.underline}, as the loss of Churchill
in the 1945 UK election half-anecdotally suggests. [What matters is that
[this linkage is]{.mark} **[strongly believed]{.mark}**]{.underline} (we
are surprised by Churchill's domestic defeat in the aftermath of
defeating the Nazis), [[and]{.mark} that **[leaders]{.mark}** might
**[act upon this belief]{.mark}, [even if it is largely wishful
thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What are the concrete strategies that a regime can use to rally the
public around the nuclear flag? The regime's ability to produce a
"nuclear civil religion" via diversion depends on both words and
actions, constituting concrete strategies along an escalation-ladder.
Considering the eminence of the proliferation threshold---acquiring
nuclear weapons---we may distinguish between pre-bomb and post-bomb
strategies, implausibly concluding with the bombing itself. Importantly,
in stepping up this diversionary escalation-ladder, failing one rung
encourages stepping up to the next, which is more dangerous and
aggressive, and less likely.

First, [[an endangered regime could]{.mark} **[leverage the nuclear
project without]{.mark} even [acquiring the bomb]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[let alone the means to deliver it]{.underline}. A [deliberately
protracted [progress towards]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[threshold of
weaponization]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[allow the regime to
showcase]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[rhetorical
defiance]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[practical
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in face of external
pressure]{.underline}, [engendering patriotic pride and
prestige]{.underline}. [Under this nuclear threshold]{.underline}, if
push comes to shove, [[the regime might]{.mark} even
**[provoke]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[foreign actors to launch a]{.mark}
**[preventive attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} intended [[to boost the
regime's]{.mark} domestic [standing]{.mark} as the protector of the
nation]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to
**[[discredit]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[opposition]{.mark} by
portraying it as a fifth column]{.underline}. Moreover, since [[nuclear
diversion **complements**]{.mark} rather than substitutes [conventional
diversion]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} at this pre-bomb stage [the
regime might]{.underline} also [engage in]{.underline}
"**[crisis-making]{.underline}**" [on grounds detached from the nuclear
issue]{.underline} (thus beyond the remit of nuclear diversion).

Second, less likely and more dangerous, the regime might opt to acquire
the bomb. Under a nuclear umbrella the regime might find it easier, and
certainly safer, to exercise defiance. Weaponization itself, especially
when demonstrated by a nuclear test, might boost national pride and the
regime's prestige (e.g. India's Smiling Buddha; see below).
Weaponization further allows the regime to employ incendiary discourse
with greatly diminished risks of foreign retaliation. Importantly,
authoritarian regimes generally suffer minimal audience costs by failing
to follow through on hollow military threats (as recently demonstrated
by DPRK).

Beyond rhetorical defiance, [[the regime may
believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the nuclear umbrella]{.mark}
**[diminishes]{.mark}** the [risks of exerting]{.mark}]{.underline} some
[perilous [diversionary strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The latter
include]{.underline} (1) **[[manufacturing]{.mark} international
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**, (2) [a **[conventional attack against
non-nuclear neighboring states]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} (3)
[[inciting]{.mark} foreign [actors to launch]{.mark} a **[preemptive
attack]{.mark}** [by indicating]{.mark} the **imminent
[possibility]{.mark}** [of employing nuclear weapons]{.mark} against a
credibly demonized enemy]{.underline}. Similar to a preventive attack,
inciting a preemptive attack would demonstrate that the diversionist was
not the first to open fire, and ostensibly acted only in self-defense,
thus perhaps improving his domestic and foreign legitimacy. This
strategy, however, is quite improbable if the diversionist had a
second-strike capability; the chances for foreign attack are then
greatly diminished.

Third, if all else fails, the most implausible, and dangerous, strategy
entails launching a nuclear attack. It is perfectly reasonable to assume
that, accidents and fanaticism aside, nuclear weapons would not be used.
Indeed, even if other strategies fail and the regime faced an imminent,
violent fall and has sufficient nuclear capacity, it is still much more
likely---in case of a nuclear adversary---that the regime would rather
yield than risk national suicide. Still, we should not dismiss the
improbable alternatives: that [[the regime might deem]{.mark} the
[launch of a nuclear attack]{.mark}]{.underline}, preferably incognito,
[[as the]{.mark} **[only viable way
out]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} either **[[ensure
regime-survival]{.underline}]{.mark}** (less likely) [or to take its
enemies down with it]{.underline}, [the so-called]{.underline}
"**[Samson Option]{.underline}**" (Hersh, 1991). Ominously, this
'[[gambling for resurrection]{.mark}']{.underline}
[scenario]{.underline} (see above) [[makes the]{.mark} **[deliberate use
of nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[seem]{.underline}]{.mark}
(in the regime's eyes) both **[[rational]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[plausible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While
admittedly provocative, this possibility should be considered, if only
because of the immense stakes involved.

Nuclear diversion is about leaders' perceptions---their beliefs,
feelings and calculations. But leaders' perceptions are strategic, that
is, they should, and often do, take into account the perceptions of
others. It is in this sense that nuclear diversion extends Walt's (1987)
concept of balance-of-threat---employed thus far only to foreign
relations---to the domestic sphere: nuclear diversion allows the regime
to create a domestic balance-of-threat vis-à-vis its opposition in order
to induce or coerce it's submission. From the regime perspective, it is
not the actual resort to these diversionary strategies, but the
projection of their desired effect on domestic opposition, that matters
most. As in MAD (mutual assured destruction), the regime must
demonstrate capability as well as communicate a credible willingness to
utilize the nuclear-related diversionary strategies. A nuclear test
often serves the purpose of demonstrating capability for the post-bomb
strategies; demonizing the external enemy is pivotal for communicating
credible willingness to attack (or provoke it to launch a preventive /
preemptive attack).

Nuclear diversion also entails learning. Present leaders may well take
their cue from past experiences---of themselves and their peers. The
potential domestic benefits of nuclear diversion for a government in
distress were demonstrated, for example, in India's 1974 first nuclear
test Smiling Buddha (Abraham, 1998; Sagan, 1996:67-68). Later, "India's
populist political movements no doubt played a role in that government's
decision to test a nuclear weapon in 1998" (Campbell, 2004:27). However,
nuclear weapons do not necessarily shield authoritarian regimes.
Proliferators who believe that nuclear possession allows them to safely
generate domestic support through conventional fighting, would do well
to learn from the experience of Pakistan in the Kargil War with India
(May-July 1999), which precipitated the subsequent coup d\'état against
the Pakistani premier Nawaz Sharif.

Learning also involves real-time re-assessments of the diversion. For
example, [[a leader might]{.mark} come to [realize]{.mark} that [he has
fallen prey to]{.mark} the]{.underline} "**[[sunk cost
fallacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[whereby]{.underline} [loss aversion
prompted him to regard nuclear diversion as having]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[passed the point of no return]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[when]{.underline} in fact [it is still possible]{.underline}, and
prospectively more beneficial, [to eschew it]{.underline}. Of course,
[leaders often fail to learn such lessons]{.underline}.

Trump's 'America First' Policy Could Leave U.S. Defense Industry Behind
Fallout from Trump's moves on trade and foreign relations was evident at
a major international air show. BY LARA SELIGMAN \| JULY 18, 2018, 12:27

But [the U.S. government showing at Farnborough]{.underline} [was
disappointing]{.underline} from the start of the weeklong exhibition
Monday. Navarro pulled out at the last minute, as did Ellen Lord, the
Pentagon's top weapons buyer; Heidi Grant, the U.S. Air Force's head of
international affairs; and other U.S. government officials. [At the
show]{.underline} itself, [only five U.S. military aircraft
appeared]{.underline} on static display [in the Defense Department
corral that normally showcases products built for the armed
services]{.underline} by Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and other U.S. defense
giants. And [though the administration has touted new efforts to loosen
restrictions on exports of armed unmanned aerial vehicles]{.underline}
built by U.S. manufacturers, [the signature MQ-9 Reaper
drone]{.underline} made by the San Diego-based General Atomics [was
nowhere to be found]{.underline}. ["It's the lowest number of aircraft
in the U.S. corral I've ever seen,]{.underline}" said Joel Johnson, an
analyst with the Teal Group. "There's this huge push in theory to go
sell American ... but the U.S. government \[showing\] in all its majesty
is the smallest I've seen in all my years at trade shows." Navarro and
the rest of the missing officials cited other commitments, but **[the
timing is suspect]{.underline}**. [Farnborough came on the heels of an
extraordinary NATO summit, where Trump rebuked U.S. allies for
inadequate defense spending]{.underline}. During a subsequent visit to
England, Trump criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit
strategy. The first day of the air show was overshadowed by Trump's
first official meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in
Helsinki, where the U.S. president publicly challenged the conclusion of
his own intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016
presidential election. He backtracked a day later, saying he misspoke.
The U.S. government officials who did show up, including Andrea
Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international
security, touted a larger-than-usual delegation and positive feedback
from both allies and industry partners. But even as they sought to
highlight American achievements, **[the potential long-term harm to U.S.
businesses was emerging in more subtle ways---for instance in Europe's
fighter jet market.]{.underline}** [The British Defense Ministry made
a]{.underline} splash the first day of Farnborough, unveiling a
prototype of a [next-generation fighter jet that will be built as a
partnership]{.underline} between Britain's BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, and
MBDA and Italy's Leonardo. The "Tempest" is planned to replace the
British Royal Air Force's Eurofighter Typhoon starting in 2035. [The
Tempest will compete directly with]{.underline} later versions of
Lockheed Martin's [F-35 for the European and potentially the Middle East
markets, as will the next-generation Franco-German fighter
jet]{.underline}, the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), announced in
2017. **[Lockheed stands to lose billions of dollars in F-35
sales]{.underline}** over the next few decades if the stealth fighter
has to share the market with Tempest and FCAS. [The U.K. is planning to
buy]{.underline} 138 [F-35s]{.underline} for its Royal Air Force,
[but]{.underline} Callan expects that the [Brits will not procure the
full complement of jets---especially if it comes down to a choice
between the F-35 and Tempest]{.underline}. Meanwhile, rumors abound that
[Italy is also considering scaling back its planned
purchase]{.underline} of 90 F-35 aircraft. Lockheed is also pitching the
F-35 in competitions to replace aging fighter fleets in Germany, Canada,
Belgium, Finland, and Switzerland. Some experts are doubtful that the
Tempest will be fielded on time given Europe's poor track record on
collaborating on combat aircraft. But regardless, **[it's clear that
Trump's foreign and trade policies are driving European nations to work
together to protect their defense capability and industrial
base]{.underline}**. "[European politics are playing a major role in
getting a next-gen fighter]{.underline}," said Richard Aboulafia, an
analyst with the Teal Group. "Any hope for internationalization of a
future fighter has been Trumped." Meanwhile**[, traditional U.S. allies
are increasingly wary of American military components]{.underline}**.
Several [non-U.S. suppliers]{.underline} interviewed at Farnborough and
at the Royal International Air Tattoo in Fairford [noted that customers
are increasingly ruling out components controlled by]{.underline} U.S.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations [(ITAR),]{.underline} which
covers virtually all U.S. military subsystems. The problem is that a
product with any ITAR-controlled components---for instance a missile's
GPS system---can be sold only to countries approved by the U.S.
government. [This policy effectively gives the United States a veto over
many potential arms sales]{.underline}, said Douglas Barrie, a senior
fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies. That's not all down to Trump. ITAR restrictions have
been a problem for contractors for years. But [the volatility and
unpredictability of the Trump presidency are not helping]{.underline},
said Gene Colabatistto, the president of defense and security at
Canada's CAE. U[.S. allies are increasingly pushing to become
self-sufficient,]{.underline} he noted. "We are not going to stop buying
U.S. products, but we are going to protect ourselves," one non-U.S.
contractor told Foreign Policy. "I think **[the question is: Is this a
short blip in trans-Atlantic relations, or is it something more of a
fundamental shift?"]{.underline}** Barrie said. "My view is that we just
don't know yet."

### UQ -- Saudi Expenditures 

#### Saudi expenditures decreasing now -- higher US spending will compensate for any arms sales decrease 

**SIPRI 19**

SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute - SIPRI is an
independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict,
armaments, arms control and disarmament. SIPRI is regularly ranked among
the most respected think tanks worldwide.) World military expenditure
grows to \$1.8 trillion in 2018 29 April 2019
https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/world-military-expenditure-grows-18-trillion-2018

(Stockholm, 29 April 2019) [Total world military expenditure rose to
\$1822 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 2.6 per
cent]{.underline} from 2017, according to new data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). [The five biggest
spenders]{.underline} in 2018 [were the United States, China, Saudi
Arabia, India and France, which together accounted for 60 per cent of
global military spending. Military spending by the USA increased for the
first time since 2010]{.underline}, while spending by China grew for the
24th consecutive year. The comprehensive annual update of the SIPRI
Military Expenditure Database is accessible from today at www.sipri.org.
Total global military spending rose for the second consecutive year in
2018, to the highest level since 1988---the first year for which
consistent global data is available. World spending is now 76 per cent
higher than the post-cold war low in 1998.\* World military spending in
2018 represented 2.1 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) or
\$239 per person. 'In 2018 [the USA and China accounted for half of the
world's military spending]{.underline},' says Dr Nan Tian, a researcher
with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure (AMEX) programme. 'The
higher level of world military expenditure in 2018 is mainly the result
of significant increases in spending by these two countries.' The USA
and China lead increase in world military expenditure [US military
spending grew]{.underline}---for the first time since 2010---[by 4.6 per
cent]{.underline}, to reach \$649 billion in 2018. The USA remained by
far the largest spender in the world, and spent almost as much on its
military in 2018 as the next eight largest-spending countries combined.
'The increase in US spending was [driven by the implementation from 2017
of new arms procurement programmes under the Trump
administration]{.underline},' says Dr Aude Fleurant, the director of the
SIPRI AMEX programme. China, the second-largest spender in the world,
increased its military expenditure by 5.0 per cent to \$250 billion in
2018. This was the 24th consecutive year of increase in Chinese military
expenditure. Its spending in 2018 was almost 10 times higher than in
1994, and accounted for 14 per cent of world military spending. 'Growth
in Chinese military spending tracks the country's overall economic
growth,' says Tian. 'China has allocated 1.9 per cent of its GDP to the
military every year since 2013.' Three decades of growth in military
spending in Asia and Oceania Military expenditure in Asia and Oceania
has risen every year since 1988. At \$507 billion, military spending in
the region accounted for 28 per cent of the global total in 2018,
compared with just 9.0 per cent in 1988. In 2018 India increased its
military spending by 3.1 per cent to \$66.5 billion. Military
expenditure by Pakistan grew by 11 per cent (the same level of growth as
in 2017), to reach \$11.4 billion in 2018. South Korean military
expenditure was \$43.1 billion in 2018---an increase of 5.1 per cent
compared with 2017 and the highest annual increase since 2005. 'The
tensions between countries in Asia as well as between China and the USA
are major drivers for the continuing growth of military spending in the
region,' says Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher with the SIPRI AMEX
programme. Increases in Central and East European countries Several
countries in Central and Eastern Europe made large increases in their
military expenditure in 2018. Spending by Poland rose by 8.9 per cent in
2018 to \$11.6 billion, while Ukraine's spending was up by 21 per cent
to \$4.8 billion. Spending by Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania
also grew (ranging from 18 per cent to 24 per cent) in 2018. 'The
increases in Central and Eastern Europe are largely due to growing
perceptions of a threat from Russia,' said Pieter Wezeman, a senior
researcher with the SIPRI AMEX programme. 'This is despite the fact that
Russian military spending has fallen for the past two years.' At \$61.4
billion, Russian military spending was the sixth highest in the world in
2018. Its spending decreased by 3.5 per cent compared with 2017. Other
notable developments Military spending in South America rose by 3.1 per
cent in 2018. This was mainly due to the increase in Brazilian spending
(by 5.1 per cent), the second increase in as many years. Military
expenditure in Africa fell by 8.4 per cent in 2018, the fourth
consecutive annual decrease since the peak in spending in 2014. There
were major decreases in spending by Algeria (--6.1 per cent), Angola
(--18 per cent) and Sudan (--49 per cent). Military spending by states
in the Middle East for which data is available fell by 1.9 per cent in
2018. Total military expenditure by all 29 North Atlantic Treaty
Organization members was \$963 billion in 2018, which accounted for 53
per cent of world spending. [The largest absolute increase in spending
in 2018 was by the USA (\$27.8 billion), while **the biggest decrease
was by Saudi Arabia** (--\$4.6 billion).]{.underline} Military spending
in Turkey increased by 24 per cent in 2018 to \$19.0 billion, the
highest annual percentage increase among the world's top 15 military
spenders. Six of the 10 countries with the highest military burden
(military spending as a proportion of GDP) in the world in 2018 are in
the Middle East: Saudi Arabia (8.8 per cent of GDP), Oman (8.2 per
cent), Kuwait (5.1 per cent), Lebanon (5.0 per cent), Jordan (4.7 per
cent) and Israel (4.3 per cent).

### UQ -- Aerospace Low 

**Aerospace industry is down -lots of reasons why and they are more
important than arms sales**

**Oxford Economics, 2018**

(Outlook: Solid U.S. Economic Momentum Poised to Cool in 2019, 21 Nov.
2018,
<https://advancedmanufacturing.org/u-s-economic-momentum-cool-2019/>)

Recent annual benchmark revisions to Federal Reserve data have markedly
changed the profile of **[aerospace output]{.underline}** in recent
years. Output growth in 2017 was much stronger than expected, increasing
by 0.4% (from a previously recorded 2.6% contraction). However, the
trend **[was deteriorating]{.underline}** at the end of the year and
that deceleration has gathered pace so far in 2018. **[Supply chain
issues at Boeing have caused the company's deliveries to hold roughly
flat]{.underline}** compared to the year-ago period,
**[despite]{.underline}** strong **[new orders]{.underline}**. Overall,
we expect a gradual pickup in Boeing deliveries in the balance of the
year to keep the contraction in aerospace activity around 2.0% in 2018,
before a gradually turning defense cycle and a significant backlog in
civilian aircraft combine to push growth back above 2.5% in 2019. While
near-term uncertainty has caused doubt surrounding U.S. competitiveness
in aerospace, the country maintains a strong and influential position in
the global industry. The U.S. accounts for half of global aerospace
production, an especially advantageous position in an environment in
which global air travel has grown at a solid 6-7% annual pace since the
depths of the financial crisis. Lower air travel costs and increasing
incomes for middle-class families are expected to continue to support
global air travel. In the near-term, however, **[the administration's
travel restrictions on Middle Eastern countries]{.underline}** may
**[weigh on the]{.underline}** domestic **[industry]{.underline}**,
reducing passenger volumes. **[Other relevant threats include pressure
for aircraft manufacturers to invest in]{.underline}** efforts to
improve **[fuel efficiency and reduce noise and other pollution.
Climate-change control measures are an additional drag]{.underline}** on
airlines' profitability, despite counter-proposals by President Trump
and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the key
global defense subsector---which comprises about a quarter of total
aerospace output---the U.S. enjoys an even stronger competitive position
with over a 60% share of global sales. However, **[President Trump's
policy stance looks increasingly damaging for U.S. defense prospects.
Tariffs on steel and aluminum could result in higher costs for weapons
systems, including the F-35]{.underline}** and other advanced aircraft.
**[This increasingly protectionist stance could also trigger retaliatory
tariffs against U.S. aerospace defense firms and erode
competitiveness.]{.underline}**

**The industry is already in a slump because of tariffs and its going to
stay that way**

future exports," Space News, 11 July 2018,
<https://spacenews.com/report-u-s-aerospace-a-trade-winner-but-tariffs-threaten-future-exports/>)

**[The]{.underline}** United States' **[aerospace and defense industries
have been in a]{.underline}** bit of a **[slump]{.underline}** over the
past few years, but they continue to deliver strong trade numbers
compared to other sectors of the economy. U.S. aerospace and defense in
2017 posted a positive trade balance, says a [new report released
Wednesday](http://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018_-Annual-Report_Web.pdf)
by the Aerospace Industries Association. "While the U.S. experienced the
third largest trade deficit on record, our industry generated \$143
billion in exports and a positive trade balance of \$86 billion,
effectively reducing the U.S. trade deficit by 10 percent." **[The
latest industry sales data is dropped amid escalating trade tensions in
the wake of]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration's
move to impose **[tariffs on]{.underline}** imported
**[metals]{.underline}** and other goods. AIA President and CEO Eric
Fanning has warned that **[a protracted trade war could hurt aerospace
sales]{.underline}**, U.S. jobs and the nation's economy as countries
affected by these tariffs fire back in retaliation. "We agree with
President Trump that trade should be fair. And we fully support efforts
to protect the intellectual property rights of American companies,"
Fanning said in a statement to SpaceNews. But he cautioned of possible
unintended consequences. "The aerospace and defense industry is
essential to America's national and economic security, and having access
to global markets and supply chains through trade allows U.S.
manufacturers to stay competitive." U.S. aerospace in 2017 accounted for
9 percent of all U.S. goods exported. "We are concerned that the
sustained imposition of **[tariffs]{.underline}** will not address
concerns about current trade dynamics and overcapacity in steel and
aluminum, and instead **[will present a disruptive threat to our
industry's export competitiveness]{.underline}**," Fanning said. "We
will continue to encourage bilateral and multilateral negotiations to
address trade differences and secure free, fair and sustainable trade."
U.S. aerospace and defense generated \$865 billion in economic output in
2017. That is a drop of one percent, or \$8.5 billion, from 2016, and of
2.1 percent from a decade-high of \$883 billion in 2012. The aerospace
and defense positive trade balance of \$86 billion is the largest of any
U.S. exporting sector. The report noted that the industry's workforce of
2.4 million people represents nearly 20 percent of the nation's
manufacturing ranks.

[The current resolutions of disapproval will not prevent the White House
from moving forward with any of the sales]{.underline}. The
administration's main purpose in using the emergency exception was to
sidestep the standard fifteen- or thirty-day review period, during which
any member of Congress can try to stop a sale through a joint resolution
of disapproval. In essence, the senators are using that same standard
tool for a nonstandard situation. Yet while twenty-two resolutions can
help grab headlines and send a signal to the executive branch, foreign
governments, and the defense industry, they are unlikely to compel
speedy legislative consideration on the Senate floor. [Even if the
Senate and House were to pass some of them, President Trump would no
doubt veto them, and the Senate is unlikely to override him given the
required two-thirds margin]{.underline}. The [longer-term implications
are more worrisome]{.underline}. The next major national security
legislation coming up for congressional debate is the annual National

standard options for expressing concern and dissent, they will likely
look to more impactful and longer-lasting options such as amendments to
the NDAA]{.underline}**. For example, [they could try to limit future
arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE specifically. One could also
imagine an attempt to raise the bar even higher for future presidents to
use the emergency AECA provision, potentially hampering the White House
in a credible emergency situation down the road.]{.underline}

The assassination of U.S. resident and Washington Post contributor Jamal
Khashoggi, a Saudi national, at the hands of the Saudi regime has
provoked a rethinking of U.S.-Saudi relations in general, and military
relations in particular.1 President [Trump's declaration that he would
not stop U.S. arms sales to the kingdo]{.underline}m even if it is
responsible for Khashoggi's death frighteningly [suggests that
contractor profits and a small number of jobs take precedence over the
need to hold a murderous regime accountable]{.underline}.2 The
President's assertion that it is possible to balance benefits to the
U.S. economy against the heinous behavior of an ally doesn't hold up to
scrutiny. No economic benefit, no matter how large, can justify
continuing to arm a regime that has not only killed a journalist in the
most brutal way imaginable but has killed thousands of civilians in
indiscriminate bombing attacks in Yemen, many of them with U.S.-supplied
bombs and aircraft.3 But [if economic arguments are to be brought into
play, they should at least be accurate]{.underline}. This has not been
the case. [The president]{.underline} [has claimed a sweeping range of
jobs]{.underline} flowing from his alleged \$110 billion arms deal with
Riyadh, from 40,000 to "over a million," in one case boosting his
estimate by 400,000 jobs within just a few days' time. To be fair, it
seems like the million jobs figure was meant to include some commercial
deals as well as the purported arms sales, but the president's ad hoc
utterances on the subject make it hard to know for sure.4 [The biggest
flaw]{.underline} in President Trump's ever-growing estimate of the U.S.
jobs at stake in arms sales to Saudi Arabia [is that the size of the
alleged \$110 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal --]{.underline} in some cases
referred to as if it is a single transaction \-- [is wildly
exaggerated.]{.underline} The White House has issued a list of deals
adding up to \$110 billion, but most of them were either notified to
Congress during the Obama administration, or are projections far into
the future of potential sales that are unlikely to ever occur.5 In hard
numbers, [the State Department estimates that the Saudi regime has
signed \$14.5 billion in letters of offer and acceptance]{.underline}
(LOA's) for new weaponry and support equipment since President Trump
took office.6 [That's a little over 10% of the much touted \$110 billion
figure]{.underline}. And [these letters of offer and acceptance
represent only one step in a longer process, not signed
contracts]{.underline}.7 Another way of looking at the issue is that
Congress has received \$20 billion in notifications of potential new
arms sales to Saudi Arabia since President Trump took office. There have
also been roughly \$2 billion in deals licensed by the State Department,
for a total of \$22 billion.8 Most of these have not reached the stage
of a letter of offer and acceptance being signed, and the largest one, a
\$13.5 billion deal for a Lockheed Martin Theater High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) missile defense system, is still under discussion.9 A
September 30, 2018 deadline for Saudi Arabia to take advantage of a 20%
discount on the deal is long past. [All of the major Saudi arms sales in
the pipeline are based on arrangements made during the Obama
years,]{.underline} when that administration notified Congress of a
record \$117 billion in arms offers to Saudi Arabia over its eight years
in office.10 [Over]{.underline} those same [eight years, there were \$65
billion worth of formal agreements signed with Saudi Arabia and roughly
\$18 billion in deliveries made]{.underline}.11 The [discrepancy between
offers, agreements and deliveries is a result of the fact that **a
significant number of offers don't eventuate in agreements or
sales**]{.underline}. In addition, [deliveries generated by completed
deals are often spread out over many years]{.underline}. And finally,
[the value of some deals is reduced between the time of the initial
offer and the final agreement.]{.underline}

[• The Trump administration has not concluded a "\$110 billion arms

much touted mega-[deal]{.underline} with Saudi Arabia [is a mixture of
orders approved during the Obama administration, a few new offers, and
tens of billions in **speculative deals**]{.underline}. Actual deals
implemented since President Trump took office total just \$14.5 billion.
• [Saudi arms sales support at most tens of thousands of

thousands or "[a million," as]{.underline} President Trump has
[claimed]{.underline}. [Actual, paid-for deliveries]{.underline} of
U.S.-produced arms for Saudi Arabia [have averaged about \$2.5 billion
per year]{.underline} over the past decade[, enough to support at most
20,000 to 40,000 jobs, some of which are located overseas]{.underline}
(see below). In addition, **[a significant number of the jobs sustained

were cancelled]{.underline}**. [Many of the workers now involved in
producing arms for Saudi Arabia would be shifted to other

that most U.S. defense contractors expect "relatively minor additions to
their U.S. workforce and \[a\] more significant buildup in Saudi Arabia"
as a result of arms deals now in the works.12 • [Many of the jobs
created by U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia will be located in Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} The jobs impact of Saudi arms sales in the United
States will be further reduced by the fact that the new Saudi economic
plan aims to have 50% of the value of that nation's arms sales produced
in the kingdom itself. U.S. firms like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and
Boeing have pledged allegiance to this goal. Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy
summed up this approach: "By working together, we can help build
world-class defense and cyber capabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia." • [The U.S.-Saudi arms trade has a **marginal impact** on the
U.S. economy. Even the high-end estimate of 40,000 U.S. jobs related to
Saudi arms deals represents less than three one-hundredths of one
percent of the U.S. labor force of over 160 million people]{.underline}.

The [estimates of U.S. jobs tied to arms sales to Saudi Arabia have been
wildly exaggerated]{.underline}, as noted above. The true number is
likely to be closer to the 40,000 jobs figure put forward at President
Trump's March 2018 White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
Bin Salman than the one million figure he mentioned off the cuff in
October 2018 (a figure that apparently was meant to include some
commercial deals, the value of which were also exaggerated).24 [The true
number of jobs tied to Saudi sales cannot be precisely determined
because the Pentagon does not report systematically on final
contracts]{.underline} or which equipment has been delivered. Thus, the
status of any given order -- whether it has been abandoned, or is at the
stage of a non-binding political commitment, or has resulted in a formal
agreement or a final contract -- is often hard to determine. But the
value of deals that have reached the state of a non-binding commitment
since President Trump took office is \$14.5 billion. [The best estimate
we can make of U.S. jobs currently linked to Saudi sales]{.underline}
[involves looking at the value of actual arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia
from 2009 through 2017]{.underline}, the first year of the Trump
administration. [By that measure we get an average total of \$2.5
billion in arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia per year]{.underline}.25
[Deliveries]{.underline} are an imperfect measure, but they [have the
advantage of representing weapons that have actually been paid for and
produced,]{.underline} so in that respect [they may be the best proxy we
have]{.underline} for the amount of money flowing into the U.S. economy
from Saudi arms sales in any given year. [If we take a generous approach
and include all jobs created in direct assembly and production of
components, along with the jobs induced by the spending of wages by
workers employed in assembly or component production, the]{.underline}
\$2.5 billion in [annual arms deliveries]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia
[would create 17,500 jobs in any given year]{.underline}.26 Even if that
figure were more than doubled -- say, equal to the 40,000 figure cited
by President Trump in his White House meeting with Mohammed Bin Salman
-- **[it would equal less than three one-hundredths of one percent of
the total U.S. labor force]{.underline}** of over 160 million people.27
And [many of the jobs sustained by Saudi arms sales would not be at risk
if specific deals were to be cancelled]{.underline}. [Defense firms with
huge backlogs]{.underline} from contracts with the Pentagon [would
simply shift many of the workers involved to other
projects]{.underline}.28 [The number of jobs tied to U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia is further reduced by the fact that many of the jobs will
be created in Saudi Arabia as part of its new economic plan, which calls
for 50% of the value of Saudi arms purchases to be produced in the
kingdom by 2030]{.underline}.29 U.S. firms have pledged allegiance to
this goal, setting up subsidiaries in Saudi Arabia, as Raytheon has
done, and agreeing to have U.S.-supplied helicopters assembled in
Riyadh, as Lockheed Martin has done. Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy summed
up this approach when he discussed his company's growing partnership
with Saudi Arabia: "By working together, we can help build world-class
defense and cyber capabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."30 And an
analysis by Reuters has revealed that most [U.S. defense contractors
expect "relatively minor additions to their U.S. workforce and \[a\]
more significant buildup in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}" as a result of
arms deals now in the works.31 Where jobs related to Saudi arms sales
can have an impact is in places where aircraft, tanks, or bombs destined
for the Saudi armed forces are assembled, such as St. Louis, Missouri
(F-15 combat aircraft); the Tucson, Arizona area (Paveway laser-guided
bombs), and Lima, Ohio (M-1 tanks). In the latter two cases, the
Pentagon is also buying the same equipment, so the impact of a Saudi
cutoff of arms purchases would be limited.

#### Arms sales not key to jobs

Technology) AMERICA'S ARMS SALES POLICY: SECURITY ABROAD, NOT JOBS AT
HOME JONATHAN CAVERLEY APRIL 6, 2018

[Even if the Trump administration boosts sales]{.underline} against such
headwinds, [this will not create many additional jobs. Arms exports are
a surprisingly inefficient means of employing people]{.underline} at
home. Using census data, [the Commerce Department estimates that a
billion dollars of defense exports would "create or sustain" 3,918
jobs]{.underline}, considerably [fewer than the 5,700 jobs per billion
created by increased US exports more broadly]{.underline}. Doubling the
United States' annual arms exports to \$40 billion, a highly unrealistic
goal, would thus create fewer than 80,000 new jobs. [There are other
industries the United States can promote that will have larger effects
on jobs]{.underline}. One reason defense exports appear to be
inefficient employment generators is that [states that spend their own
money on buying American weapons also care about "jobs]{.underline},
jobs, jobs" [for their own people,]{.underline} as well as supporting
their own aspirational defense industries. Most [countries require
"offsets," mandating that a percentage of any arms deal]{.underline}
(often 50 to 100 percent) [must be re-invested in the importing state's
economy.]{.underline} Between 2013 and 2015, these offsets, had the work
been performed in the United States, would have created or sustained
over 46,000 jobs. In publicizing a recent Saudi deal for 150 S-70 Black
Hawk utility helicopters at roughly \$6 billion, Lockheed Martin
predicted that it would "support" 900 jobs. But half those jobs would be
in Saudi Arabia. Yet [another reason that arms exports are an
inefficient employment mechanism:]{.underline} Any a[dditional U.S.
market share is likely to be heavily subsidized]{.underline}. [In 2016,
the United States spent \$10 billion buying weapons for other
countries]{.underline}, roughly 10 percent of the entire global arms
export market, equivalent to Singapore's or Algeria's defense budget.
Moreover, [over the past six years, the Defense Department waived
another \$16 billion in]{.underline} normally [mandatory
fees]{.underline} for Foreign Military Sales --- including \$3.5 billion
for a \$15 billion Saudi agreement --- largely to close deals that may
have gone to other suppliers. In short, [when it comes to boosting the
domestic economy, arms sales contain relatively little
juice]{.underline}. And, as we shall see[, it may not be worth the
squeeze.]{.underline}

lying]{.underline}**. The US doesn't sell that many weapons to **[MBS

355,500 in 2016, according to the [most the recent
estimates](https://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_AnnualReport_FF_Final_Web.pdf)

workers make up less than 0.5 percent of the total US labor

services for the entire US military. **[It's unlikely that many of
them]{.underline}**, if any, **[depend]{.underline}** directly **[on

would vanish if Saudi money disappeared. "The relationship between arms
sales and jobs is exaggerated," William Hartung, an expert on US weapons
exports for the Center for International Policy, told me]{.underline}**

and oversight of U.S. foreign security aid and arms sales. ) Trends in
Major U.S. Arms Sales in 2017
MAR%206\--US%20Arms%20Sales%202017%20Report%20manual%20footnotes%20(1)\_1.pdf

[One of the biggest changes in U.S. arms transfer policy]{.underline}
under the Trump Administration [is]{.underline} President [Trump's
highly public promotion of]{.underline} international [arms sales as a
source of jobs]{.underline} in the United States. Job creation has
always been a factor in U.S. arms exports, but no U.S. president
broadcast this alleged benefit of weapons trading so loudly or so
consistently as he did. The irony of the Trump Administration approach
is that **[U.S. weapons production is increasingly questioned as an
effective way to create American jobs]{.underline}**. As Heidi
Garrett-Peltier has noted in a 2017 report on military spending and
employment, [spending on infrastructure, alternative energy, or health
care creates one and a half times as many jobs as military spending, and
spending on education can create up to twice as many
jobs.]{.underline}17 U.S. taxpayers usually provide billions each year
through funds such as the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to support
U.S. arms sales. [Even in cases like U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
where the customer pays the full cost of the weapons purchase, the
economic benefits are often less than meets the eye]{.underline}. First
of all, [large deals take time and many are sidelined]{.underline}
somewhere along the line due to changes of heart or lack of funds on the
part of the purchasing nation. As noted above, the Trump
administration's \$5.2 billion offer of F-18 combat aircraft to Canada
is likely to be cancelled as a result of a trade dispute with the United
States. And [of the \$110 billion in arms offers made to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} during the Obama Administration years, [only half of
them have resulted in formal agreements,]{.underline} and [only about
one quarter of them have resulted in weapons actually being
delivered]{.underline}.18 So, when an announcement of a major,
multi-billion-dollar arms deal is made[, it cannot be taken for granted
that all of those dollars will ultimately be spent]{.underline}, and if
they are, the expenditures may be spread over many years. In most cases
**[fewer jobs will be created over the life of a deal than
anticipated]{.underline}** in the initial fanfare of a major sales
announcement. Second, U.S. arms sales disappoint as a jobs creator
because [in many cases the jobs created by a sale are shared with the
purchasing nation via offset and coproduction agreements]{.underline}.
An offset agreement is a deal between the selling company and the
purchasing nation in which the company invests in the purchasing
country's economy as a way to "offset" the costs of the deal.
Coproduction, as the name suggests, involves production of part of a
system in the recipient nation. In 2017, the Trump Administration
proposed a total of 16 major arms deals that would support the
manufacturing of U.S. military equipment abroad (see Figure 2). These
deals include the sales mentioned above to Canada and Japan. Similar to
Japan, [a total 79 foreign companies are producing major components for
the F-35]{.underline}.19 As a result, [many of the major U.S. arms sales
will likely create jobs in foreign countries rather than in the United
States]{.underline}. **[These foreign arms manufacturing jobs can also
cut American jobs in the future]{.underline}** if U.S. companies can't
compete against foreign countries making the same items at lower costs.
[Sales to the Persian Gulf]{.underline} -- the biggest market for U.S.
weapons in recent years -- **[are increasingly characterized by major
offset arrangements]{.underline}**. For example, in exchange for the
U.A.E.'s purchase of Lockheed Martin weapons, that company is helping
the U.A.E. develop a state-of-the-art robotic machine tool industry that
will sell its wares to defense and aerospace firms, possibly at the
expense of similar sales by firms based in the United States.20 And
[under Saudi Arabia's Plan 2030 economic reform plan, the country has a
goal of producing 50 percent of the value of the arms it
purchases]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia. [That process is already under
way]{.underline} through a deal to sell the kingdom 132 Sikorsky Black
Hawk helicopters that will be assembled at a factory in Riyadh.21

**Economic benefits are uncertain and overblown AND the exchange itself
is unethical because it results in civilian deaths and war crimes**

Arms Deal," Defense One, 22 May 2017,

So **[what [we have]{.mark} is [a deal that is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
mostly a mix of **[[offers already made and promises yet to be
kept]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And when and if some of the new offers are
formally notified to Congress -- a process that will at least reveal
what systems are to be provided at what cost -- **[[there is no
guarantee]{.mark} that [they will produce]{.mark} signed
[contracts]{.mark} and actual deliveries of weaponry]{.underline}**. For
example, during the Obama years, Congress was formally notified of
offers of weapons, training, and military support services to Saudi
Arabia [worth \$115
billion](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ).
So far **[[only]{.underline}]{.mark}** about **[[half
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** those **[[offers]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
**[[resulted in formal agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and less than
\$20 billion in goods and services have actually been delivered. And
deliveries of major systems can take years. For example, an offer of
F-15 combat aircraft to the Saudi Air Force that was announced to
Congress in October 2010 didn't result in the first planes being
delivered until December 2016. This is all by way of saying that the
ultimate **[[value]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Trump administration's
arms offers to Saudi Arabia **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**o **[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**e
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**etermined. **[[The \$110 billion figure
looks]{.mark} suspiciously [like an effort to post]{.mark} some [big
numbers to underscore]{.mark} the administration's [uncritical support
for Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, its animosity towards Iran, and
its focus on "jobs, jobs, jobs," as the president put it. **[[The jobs
argument is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
**[[assembly]{.underline}]{.mark}** of some of the systems, such as some
helicopters from Lockheed Martin, **[[will be done in Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More work for Riyadh will no doubt
follow, since that government's new long-term economic plan calls for
the development of its arms industry -- some of which may well be built
with technology supplied by the United States. Some of the **[deals may
never materialize. [No deals, no jobs]{.mark}. And [military spending is
the least effective way to create jobs, according to [a 2014
study](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic/economy/employment)]{.mark}]{.underline}**
by the Costs of War Project **[[at Brown]{.mark}
University]{.underline}**'s Watson Institute. Focusing on industries of
the future, like clean energy technologies, would not only create more
jobs in the short term, but it would get the United States a foothold in
a growth area that could sustain good paying jobs for generations to
come. But **[whatever the size of [Trump's]{.mark}]{.underline}** big
**[[deal]{.mark}, it [raises]{.mark} serious [human rights and foreign
policy concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Sen. Chris Murphy,
D-Connecticut, put it best when he expressed concern about the regional
impact of the deal: "What do we have to gain by going in so
enthusiastically with the Sunnis against the Shia in their fight for
power in the Middle East? This isn't our fight, and history suggests the
U.S. military meddling in the Middle East ends up great for U.S.
military contractors, but pretty miserable for everyone else."
**[[The]{.mark} administration's]{.underline}** decision to revive a
**[[deal for precision-guided munitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Saudi
Arabia **[[is]{.mark} particularly [troubling]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
**[[these]{.mark} are the kind of [weapons]{.mark} that [have been used
in]{.mark}]{.underline}** Riyadh's **[[brutal [bombing campaign in
Yemen](http://www.defenseone.com/topic/yemen/), which has killed

[could be war crimes]{.mark}---crimes [in which the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [may be complicit]{.mark}]{.underline}**, given their
provision of arms and refueling services for the Saudi bombing campaign.
Equally concerning is the potential attack by another major U.S. arms
recipient, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), on the port of Hodeida in
southern Yemen. The port is the main entry point for humanitarian aid to
Yemen at a time when the country is on the brink of famine[. **[Rather

about \$900 million from Saudi sales in 2020 and an additional \$450
million contract if Saudi Arabia decides to deploy an American ballistic
missile defense system. Contractors like Lockheed Martin are increasing
revenue streams at the expense of millions of lives in Yemen. **[The
United States should not]{.underline}** continue to **[prioritize

and the continuously dire implications of Saudi Arabia weapons
purchases. Ending the arms sales will also lift the veil on the Trump
Administration's disingenuous economic justifications for politically
expedient Saudi relations. The Trump Administration has long used
economic arguments to cover for their political and military desires.
However, the arms sales to Saudi Arabia transcend economics. By
maintaining Saudi arms sales, the United States is
[declining](https://duckofminerva.com/2018/10/with-arms-sales-its-not-just-the-economy-stupid.html)
to hold countries accountable in exchange for the comfortable benefits
offered by the status quo. **[The administration has attempted to

**[ineffective at job development]{.underline}**, implicitly condoning

### Impact Inevitable

**Impact is inevitable -- Saudi Arabia to start manufacturing at home**

**Campbell, 2018**

(Alexia Fernandez -- MA in Journalism and Public Affairs & current Vox
politics and policy reporter, "Trump says selling weapons to Saudi
Arabia will create a lot of jobs. That's not true." Vox, 20 Nov. 2018,
<https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/17/17967510/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales-khashoggi>)

In the short term, selling weapons to Saudi Arabia may support some US
factory jobs. But here's the thing: **[Saudi Arabia plans to start
manufacturing a lot of those weapons at home. Building up a local
weapons manufacturing industry is part of the crown
prince's]{.underline}** much-touted [2030 **[economic development
plan]{.underline}**](http://vision2030.gov.sa/en/node/6), which is
supposed to reduce the kingdom's economic dependence on oil exports.
**[Saudi Arabia expects half of all jobs created by weapons deals to be
local jobs. Here's what he says]{.underline}** in an [outline of the
plan](http://vision2030.gov.sa/en/node/6) that the Saudi government has
posted online**[: Localization will be achieved]{.underline}** through
direct investments and strategic partnerships with leading companies
**[in this sector. These moves will]{.underline}** transfer knowledge
and technology, and **[build]{.underline}** national expertise in the
fields of **[manufacturing, maintenance, repair, research and
development]{.underline}**. We will also train our employees and
establish more specialized and integrated industrial complexes.
**[American defense contractors]{.underline}** that sell a lot of
military equipment to Saudi Arabia **[are on board.
Raytheon]{.underline}**, for example, **[is in the process of [opening a
subsidiary](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raytheon-and-saudi-arabia-military-industries-announce-strategic-partnership-300461082.html)
in Riyadh]{.underline}**. Aside from shifting manufacturing jobs
overseas, Saudi Arabia's defense industry could eventually compete with
the US defense industry. This focus [would completely
change](https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-security-arms/update-2-saudi-arabia-launches-military-industries-company-idUSL8N1IJ5ZG)
the current economic relationship between both countries, according to
Reuters. Since Trump took office, Saudi Arabia has signed about [\$14.5
billion](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/trump-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-sanctions/index.html)
in commitments to buy US weaponry. No contracts have actually been
signed, so details are scarce. Items in the pipeline include bombs,
missiles, tanks, and aircraft. But [at least
one](http://securityassistance.org/fact_sheet/us-arms-sales-notifications-2018)
involves manufacturing parts overseas, not in the United States. Now
Congress is reportedly reviewing another proposed sale of 12,000 guided
bombs to Saudi Arabia, [according to
Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-arms-saudi-emirates/congress-reviewing-sale-of-precision-munitions-to-saudis-uae-sources-idUSKCN1IO032).
The Senate could cancel the sale if they can get enough votes, and some
senators have suggested this as a form of sanctions in response to the
Khashoggi case. Trump said that would be bad for American workers. But,
once again, US workers don't need Saudi Arabia.

https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trumps-arms-exports-policy-debunking-key-assumptions/

However, [**the annual worth of arms exports tends to be uneven** and
dependent on what clients are seeking to buy]{.underline}. [The sale of
major and expensive weapon systems, such as warplanes, can
single-handedly boost the worth of arms exports for any given
year]{.underline}. The highest recorded year of arms sales was FY 2012
totaling \$69.1 billion, but this included a single \$29 billion deal
for the sale of 84 F-15s to Saudi Arabia. According to the figures of
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in FY 2014 arms exports totaled
\$34.2 billion, FY 2015 totaled \$47 billion, FY 2016 totaled \$33.6
billion, FY 2017 totaled \$41.9 billion, while FY 2018 has so far
totaled \$46.9 billion. [Large-scale sales of major weapon systems
create capacity limits in consecutive years]{.underline}. For example,
[the surge in the sale of advanced fighter jets to the Gulf countries
during the Obama presidency will slow down the future sale]{.underline}
of these high-priced items in the years to come, [affecting overall
totals]{.underline} of annual sales. Principally, **[the periodic
military needs of clients are going to play a far larger role in
determining whether the United States is going to increase foreign arms
sales in the coming years]{.underline}** than the governmental
streamlining of organizations and procedures.

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict]{.underline}? Or might downturns encourage austerity and
economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that economic stress is associated with **conciliatory
policies** between strategic rivals]{.underline}. [For states that view
each other as military threats, the **biggest step possible toward
bilateral cooperation** is to terminate the rivalry by taking political
steps to manage the competition]{.underline}. [Drawing on **data from
109 distinct rival dyads** since 1950]{.underline}, [67 of which
terminated]{.underline}, [the evidence suggests rivalries were
approximately **twice as likely** to terminate during economic downturns
than they were during periods of economic normalcy]{.underline}. [This
is true **controlling for all of the main alternative explanations** for
peaceful relations between foes]{.underline} ([democratic
status]{.underline}, [nuclear weapons]{.underline} possession,
[capability imbalance]{.underline}, [common enemies]{.underline}, and
[international systemic changes]{.underline}), as well as many other
possible confounding variables. This research questions existing
theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with
diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace
may result from economic troubles. [I define a rivalry as the perception
by national elites of two states that the other state possesses
conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient
severity that future military conflict is likely]{.underline}. [Rivalry
termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where
conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke
interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance
in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures
unlikely]{.underline}. In other words, [rivalries terminate when the
elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has
been reduced dramatically]{.underline}. This definition draws on a
growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the
research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P.
Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that
of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as
situations in which "\[b\]oth actors view each other as a significant
politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy."2 In other work,
Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The
presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think
are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and
foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their
constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage.
Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able
to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as
well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign
policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and
histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of
strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this
project's empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination
as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the
existence of a rivalry. [Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior
through five primary channels]{.underline}. (1) Economic crises lead to
austerity pressures, which in turn incent leaders to search for ways to
cut defense expenditures. (2) Economic crises also encourage strategic
reassessment, so that leaders can argue to their peers and their publics
that defense spending can be arrested without endangering the state.
This can lead to threat deflation, where elites attempt to downplay the
seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. (3) If a state faces
multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to consider threat
prioritization, a process that is postponed during periods of economic
normalcy. (4) Economic crises increase the political and economic
benefit from international economic cooperation. Leaders seek foreign
aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad during periods
of economic trouble. This search is made easier if tensions are reduced
with historic rivals. (5) Finally, during crises, elites are more prone
to select leaders who are perceived as capable of resolving economic
difficulties, permitting the emergence of leaders who hold heterodox
foreign policy views. [**Collectively**, these mechanisms make it much
more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to
during periods of economic normalcy]{.underline}. This section reviews
this causal logic in greater detail, while also providing historical
examples that these mechanisms recur in practice. **[Economic Crisis
Leads to Austerity]{.underline}** Economic crises generate pressure for
austerity. [Government revenues are a function of national economic
production, so that when production diminishes through recession,
revenues available for expenditure also diminish]{.underline}. [Planning
almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the
deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can
be **sizable**]{.underline}. When growth slowdowns are prolonged, the
cumulative departure from planning targets can grow even further, even
if no single quarter meets the technical definition of recession.
Pressures for austerity are felt most acutely in governments that face
difficulty borrowing to finance deficit expenditures. [This is
especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources
of credit]{.underline}. Even for states that can borrow, however,
[intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore
confidence]{.underline}---a belief in what is sometimes called
"expansionary austerity"---[generates incentives to curtail
expenditure]{.underline}. [These incentives to cut occur precisely when
populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions
especially painful that target]{.underline} poverty alleviation,
[welfare]{.underline} programs, or economic subsidies. As a result, mass
and elite constituents strongly resist such cuts. Welfare programs and
other forms of public spending may be especially susceptible to a policy
"ratchet effect," where people are very reluctant to forego benefits
once they have become accustomed to their availability.6 As Paul Pierson
has argued, "[The politics]{.underline} \[[of welfare
state]{.underline}\] [retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it
imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters]{.underline} in
return for diffuse and uncertain gains."7 Austerity Leads to Cutbacks in
Defense Spending At a minimum, the political costs of pursuing austerity
through cutbacks in social and economic expenditures alone make such a
path unappealing. In practice, [this can spur policymakers to curtail
national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of
economic turmoil]{.underline}. [There is often more discretion over
defense spending than over other areas in the budget]{.underline}, [and
it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass
public]{.underline}. Many militaries need foreign arms and foreign
ammunition for their militaries, so defense expenditures are doubly
costly since they both take up valuable defense budget space while also
sending hard currency overseas, rather than constituencies at home.
[Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the
financial sector, which shows a **strong aversion** to military
conflict]{.underline} even if that means policies of appeasement and
conciliation.8 During periods of economic expansion, the opportunity
costs associated with defense expenditure---the requirement for higher
taxes or foregone spending in other areas---are real but acceptable.
[Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a
choice between different types of spending]{.underline}. [There is a
constituency for defense spending]{.underline} in the armed services,
intelligence agencies, and arms industries, [but]{.underline} **[even in
militarized economies]{.underline}** [this constituency tends to be
numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic
expenditures over military ones.]{.underline} Defense Cutbacks Encourage
Rapprochement An interest in defense cutbacks can lead to conciliatory
behavior through two paths. **[First]{.underline}**, [the cutbacks
themselves serve as a **concrete signal** to adversaries that the
military threat posed by the economically distressed state is
declining.]{.underline} [This permits the other state to halt that
portion of defense spending dedicated to keeping up, **breaking the back
of ongoing arms races**]{.underline} through reciprocated, but
non-negotiated moves. [Unilateral conventional force reductions were a
major element of Gorbachev's foreign policy in the late
1980s]{.underline}, alongside negotiated strategic arms control, and
diplomatic efforts to achieve political understandings with the United
States.9 [Gorbachev similarly used force reductions in Afghanistan,
Mongolia, and the Soviet Far East to signal to China in 1987 that he was
serious about political negotiations]{.underline}.10 Elsewhere,
[non-negotiated]{.underline}, tit-for-tat [military redeployments
facilitated Argentina-Brazil rapprochement]{.underline}.11
**[Second]{.underline}**, [leaders may believe cutbacks are necessary,
but would be dangerous in the absence of negotiated improvements with
traditional foes]{.underline}. [Economic downturns can serve as
**motivation to pursue arms control** or political
settlement]{.underline}. During periods of normalcy, such outcomes would
be positives, but are viewed as "too hard" by political leaders that
move from one urgent problem to the next. [During periods of economic
crisis]{.underline}, however, [arms control or political improvements
might allow for much needed cuts in defense spending, and are **pursued
with greater vigor**]{.underline}. The [Johnson]{.underline}
administration [attempted both unilateral and negotiated arms
limitations because of budgetary concerns]{.underline} as President
Johnson and Secretary McNamara struggled to pay for the "Great Society"
domestic programs and the increasingly costly Vietnam War. They first
attempted unilateral "caps" on costly nuclear forces and anti-ballistic
missile defenses and when this failed to lead to a reciprocal Soviet
response they engaged in formal arms control talks. [Détente continued
in the Nixon administration]{.underline}, accelerating in 1971 and 1972,
[simultaneous with rising budget deficits and inflation]{.underline} so
serious that Nixon instituted price controls. [Nixon's decision to
sharply limit anti-ballistic missile defenses to enable arms control
talks was **contrary to his strategic views, but necessitated by a
difficult budgetary environment**]{.underline} that made paying for more
missile defense emplacements unrealistic.12 As Nixon told his national
security advisor Kissinger in an April 1972 discussion of ballistic
missile and anti-ballistic missile developments: "You know we\'ve got a
hell of a budget problem. We\'ve got to cut it down, we\'ve got to cut 5
billion dollars off next year\'s defense budget. So, I don\'t want to
\[inaudible: do it?\] unless we\'ve got some settlement with the
Russians."13 In practice, [unilateral defense cuts and force reductions
are frequently combined with negotiated political agreements in a
sequential, iterative fashion, where a unilateral reduction will
**signal seriousness** that opens the way for political
agreement]{.underline}, [which in turn permits **even deeper
reductions**]{.underline}. Defense cuts and force reductions are not
only a means to achieve rivalry termination, but also a goal in and of
themselves that rivalry termination helps secure. Leaders are seeking
resources from defense they can use elsewhere. Thus when Argentine
leader Raul Alfonsín campaigned for the need for drastic budgetary
austerity, his specific "platform was the reduction of military spending
to use it for the other ministries, connected with the concept of
eliminating the hypothesis of conflict" with Argentinian rivals,
according to Adalberto Rodríguez Giavarini, who served in Alfonsín's
ministry of defense (and later was Argentina's foreign minister).14
Similarly, Gorbachev was motivated to reduce arms in the late 1980s
because he determined it was necessary to cut Soviet defense spending
and defense production, and repurpose part of the defense industry to
make consumer and civilian capital goods, according to contemporary U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency classified assessments.15 [Thus the "**main
reason**" why strategic arms control breakthroughs occurred from 1986 to
1988 and the Soviet Afghan intervention concluded in 1989 was a
realization within the Politburo of "excessively high expenditures on
defense," according to Nikolai Ryzhkov, Gorbachev's prime
minister]{.underline}.16 **[Economic Downturns Provoke Strategic
Reassessment]{.underline}**: [Threat Deflation and
Prioritization]{.underline} [Economic downturns encourage leaders to
seek new ideas to use to frame their policy problems]{.underline}.
During periods of economic difficulty, elites can come to realize that
their problems are not amenable to old solutions, and search for new
ideas.17 [During an economic crisis, politics and policy are "**more
fluid**," as old answers seem stale and insufficient]{.underline}.18 [An
ideational entrepreneur that can link economic **lemons** to foreign
policy **lemonade** can find a patron when leaders are casting about for
ways to reframe the world in acceptable ways to their peers and
publics]{.underline}. The behavior of an old foe is often ambiguous, and
can be viewed as either injurious to one's interests or neutral toward
them. During periods of normalcy, the motivation of defense
establishments is tilted toward threat and danger. [During periods of
economic crisis, national leaders have a counteracting motivation to
**downplay such dangers**, so that the threats faced by a nation are
manageable through available resources]{.underline}. Economic
difficulties provide a motivation for leaders to view equivocal signals
from the international system in a way that is benign. To the extent
that [rivalries are perpetuated because of threat inflation, economic
downturns provide incentives to deflate the threat, potentially
**disrupting cycles of competition and enmity**]{.underline}. [South
Korean president Kim Dae-jong]{.underline} came to power [in the
aftermath of the 1998 Asian economic crisis, pursued a "sunshine policy"
toward the North]{.underline}, cut South Korean defense spending in
nominal and real terms, and pursued a policy toward North Korea that
political scientist Dong Sun Lee called "threat deflation" despite the
growing North Korean nuclear weapons threat.19 Economic crises can also
spur strategic reassessment through another channel. If leaders view
economic problems as structural, rather than a temporary gale, they may
come to question whether available national resources are sufficient to
confront all of the national threats identified in the past. [This
creates incentives to economize threats, seeking political settlements
where possible in order to focus remaining resources on competitions
that can be won]{.underline}. A concrete example: [in 1904, the
chancellor to the Exchequer wrote]{.underline} his cabinet colleagues:
["\[W\]e must frankly admit that the financial resources of the United
Kingdom are inadequate to do all that we should desire in the matter of
Imperial defense."]{.underline}20 [The result was a British decision to
minimize political disagreement with the United States]{.underline} and
focus on other defense challenges. While such a decision is in line with
realist advice, it occurred not when the power trajectories were evident
to British decisionmakers but when the budget situation had reached a
crisis that could no longer be ignored. Economic Downturns Increase
Incentives for International Economic Cooperation [Economic
downturns]{.underline} not only create incentives to cut spending, they
[encourage **vigorous pursuit** of opportunities for economic
cooperation]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, too, [can engender
conciliatory behavior]{.underline}. [Economic downturns can **increase
motives to pursue trade** and investment]{.underline}. Rivalries with
old foes often directly impinge on trade and investment with the
adversary and may indirectly impinge on trade and investment with third
parties, especially if the rivalry is viewed as being likely to generate
disruptive military conflict. Additionally, [economic aid is sometimes
used as an inducement for adversaries to set aside a political
dispute]{.underline}. This aid can either serve as a side payment from
one rival to another, or it can be offered by a third party to one or
both rivals as an incentive to set aside lingering disputes. [Such aid
is more attractive during periods of economic turmoil than during
periods of comparative normalcy]{.underline}. In South Asia, [India and
Pakistan struggled from 1947 to 1960 with]{.underline} how to manage
[water]{.underline} resources in the Indus Rivers basin, inheriting a
canal system meant to service pre-partitioned India. [Pakistan,
suffering an economic downturn, and India, reliant on foreign aid to
avert economic crisis, agreed to an Indus Waters Treaty in
1960]{.underline} to resolve the lingering dispute, made possible in
substantial part because of World Bank financing that was especially
attractive to the struggling economies. In the Middle East, [Egypt and
Israel]{.underline} [made the hard choices necessary for the Camp David
accord in 1979 precisely because the Sadat and Begin governments faced
difficult economic situations]{.underline} at home [that made the U.S.
aid guarantee]{.underline} in exchange for a peace agreement especially
[attractive]{.underline}.21 [In 1982, the Yemen's People's Republic
agreed to stop its attempts to destabilize Oman, because otherwise Yemen
would not receive economic assistance from Arab oil producing
states]{.underline} that it desperately needed.22 In the late
[1990s]{.underline}, [El Niño-induced flooding devastated Ecuador and
Peru, spurring reconciliation as leaders sought to increase trade,
secure investment, and slash military expenditures]{.underline} so they
could be used at home.23 As one Western diplomat assessed at the time,
Ecuador and Peru "have decided it\'s better to see reason.... They see
foreign companies eager to invest in South America, and if Peru and
Ecuador are in conflict, it makes them less attractive than, say,
Argentina or Brazil or Chile for investment purposes. That\'s the last
thing either country wants."24 **[Economic Downturns Can Cause
Meaningful Leadership Change]{.underline}** The above mechanisms have
identified how economic difficulties can alter the preferences of an
incumbent leader. Additionally, [economic crises can lead to leadership
turnover and]{.underline}, during periods of difficulty, [the selection
process that determines new leadership can **loosen ideological
strictures** that relate to extant rivalries]{.underline}. [Leaders may
be selected based on judgments about their ability to cope with economic
problems, with greater elite acceptance of ideological heterogeneity in
foreign policy beliefs]{.underline} than in periods of normalcy.25 In
Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth's words, "If everything is going
well or is stable, then why select leaders who might subvert the
triedand-true identity? But if that identity is leading to increased
material difficulties, pressure for change will likely mount. In these
circumstances, [those who are willing to alter or adjust the hallowed
precepts of the existing identity and its associated practices are more
likely to assume power]{.underline}."26 [Economic crisis, then, can spur
incumbent leaders to either **abandon the "baggage" of rivalry** or
facilitate the selection of new leaders that do not carry such baggage.
The most well-known example of an incumbent selectorate looking for a
reformer]{.underline}, even one without much foreign policy experience,
[involves Mikhail Gorbachev's ascension]{.underline} to the Soviet
premiership. In political scientist Jerry Hough's words, "If the rate of
economic growth continued to decline, if administrative and labor
efficiency continued to fall, if corruption was not punished, these
conditions would have dangerous consequences for the \[Soviet Union in
the\] 1980s and 1990s.... Gorbachev's promotion was an answer to these
concerns."27

#### Maybe something about counterterror 

**Guyer, 2019**

(Jonathan - former fellow of Harvard\'s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced
Study and current managing editor of The American Prospect, "Needed: A
U.S. Policy on Saudi Arabia," The American Prospect, 18 March 2019,
<https://prospect.org/article/needed-us-policy-on-saudi-arabia>)

[The U.S.-Saudi relationship was never based on deep cultural
ties]{.underline} between the two countries [but rather on security
arrangements]{.underline}, petroleum deals, protecting the trade routes
surrounding the world's largest producer of crude oil, and sharing
intelligence about terror groups that threaten both countries. The
relationship had already deteriorated after the September 11, 2001,
terror attacks. The U.S. military presence in the Gulf had been a source
of friction for Saudis, and in America anger was widespread against the
kingdom. "9/11 also crystallized Islamophobia in the United States, and
the American reaction to it was seen as belying Saudi expectations and
U.S. assurances of solid friendship," Chas Freeman, who served as
American ambassador to Saudi from 1989 to 1992, told me. "**[The
relationship became purely transactional]{.underline}**---each side
asking what's in it for me, rather than a partnership, which was the
case when I was there." That partnership is rooted in FDR's 1945 bargain
with King Abdel-Aziz Ibn Saud, forged aboard the USS Quincy on Great
Bitter Lake and endlessly recounted in both countries' lore. U.S.
security for Saudi energy supplies remains one of the fundamental
pillars of the two countries' relationship and indeed much of U.S.
foreign policy in the Middle East. But in the 21st century, this
relationship has potential to change. "They need us much more than we
need them," Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official, told
me. "We don't need their oil, but they need our security guarantee." As
fracking has made the U.S. a net oil exporter since the mid-2000s,
Americans have imported less oil from Saudi, from 1.36 million barrels
daily in 2012 to shy of a million daily in 2017 and continuing to drop.
Yet the U.S. remains the prime guarantor of the world's crude. That
assumed responsibility is infrequently questioned yet has a huge
footprint: The Navy's Fifth Fleet operates out of the Gulf island
kingdom of Bahrain, where more than 7,000 servicemen and personnel serve
as traffic cop for the global flow of oil around the Strait of Hormuz
and the Arabian Peninsula. The U.S. also maintains 10,000 military
personnel at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, among the robust network of
basing and military cooperation throughout the Arab Gulf and Levant,
Israel, and the Horn of Africa. [The U.S]{.underline}. too [depends on
Saudi, and its strategic location on the Arabian Peninsula, for
overflight permissions for aircraft operating in and out of Afghanistan
and Iraq,]{.underline} but analysts note that it's part of a broader
security architecture that is of particular benefit for the Saudis.
**[The second pillar of the relationship is intelligence cooperation.
"They're a superstar counterterrorism partner, and their tips have saved
lives,]{.underline}**" Anne Patterson, a former ambassador to Egypt and
Pakistan, told me over breakfast in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She
cautioned, however, that "CT \[counterterrorism\] is not the same thing
as Iran. These Sunni extremists pose a bigger threat."

#### Arms sales don't boost Saudi capacity 

**Ryan, 2018**

(Missy, "As crisis intensifies, what's at stake in America's military
partnership with Saudi Arabia?," Washington Post, 12 October 2019,

But analysts and former officials said the [cultivation of Saudi Arabia
as the top U.S. arms customer had not yet turned the kingdom into
Washington's essential military partner in the Arab world]{.underline}.
"In terms of the military or security benefit we get, **[there's no
automatic translation from those weapons into an operational
capacity]{.underline}** unfortunately," said Andrew Miller, deputy
director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. "[There
would need to be more of an emphasis on training]{.underline} and less
of an emphasis on the systems themselves." [Saudi Arabia's military
performance has been hobbled by]{.underline} a number of issues,
analysts said, including [shortcomings in logistics and maintenance, a
weak noncommissioned officer corps and a system for military
appointments based on connections rather than merit]{.underline}. [Saudi
Arabia has requested less hands-on training from the U.S.]{.underline}
military than some other Arab nations. [It also relies on outside help
to maintain much of its high-tech weaponry.]{.underline} **["The bang
they get for that large buck is extremely low,"]{.underline}** said
Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa and a
former analyst at Canada's Department of National Defense. ["It's
especially shocking given how much money they spend and the fact they
have some of the most advanced systems in the world." American military
officials continue to see elite forces from the United Arab Emirates,
Jordan and Iraq as their preferred tactical ground partners]{.underline}
among Arab nations. [The war in Yemen]{.underline}, where Riyadh is
leading a coalition of nations battling Houthi militants linked to
Iran[, has laid bare those challenges]{.underline} as Saudi Arabia
remains mired in an expensive war it started over U.S. objections more
than three years ago. [The kingdom maintains a small force on the
ground]{.underline}, [relying on local and third-country forces to
battle]{.underline} the Houthi troops. Saudi planes have repeatedly
struck civilian sites, raising questions about their targeting practices
and, for the first time, stirring a growing tide of opposition in
Congress. Lawmakers have delayed one major sale because of concerns
about civilian harm and have advanced proposals that could block U.S.
military aid to the Yemen operation, which includes aerial refueling and
intelligence sharing.

Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official, said U.S. and
[Saudi intelligence cooperation had long]{.underline} been more reliably
[beneficial for the United States]{.underline} than the two country's
military alliance. For years, Saudi officials have fed their American
counterparts information about Islamist groups or plots against the
United States. But **[Riedel said the quality of that intelligence has
deteriorated since Mohammed took over as the country's de facto ruler
and pushed out the former intelligence chief]{.underline}**. Brian
Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress think tank,
said recent events in Istanbul brought to a head questions about the
Trump administration's decision to designate the kingdom as its primary
partner in the Arab world. ["If your whole Middle East strategy is
premised on the idea that we've got to work directly through Riyadh, but
Riyadh has shown itself to be such a flawed partner, it raises questions
about what we're doing,]{.underline}" he said.

#### Something about NATO or Russia sales

**NYT 17**

Turkey Signs Russian Missile Deal, Pivoting From NATO
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/world/europe/turkey-russia-missile-deal.html

ISTANBUL --- [In the clearest sign of his pivot toward
Russia]{.underline} and away from NATO and the West, President Recep
Tayyip [Erdogan announced]{.underline} on Tuesday that [Turkey had
signed a deal to purchase a Russian surface-to-air missile
system]{.underline}.

[The deal cements]{.underline} a recent r[approchement with Russia,
despite differences over the war in Syria, and comes as Turkey's ties
with the United States and European Union have become
strained.]{.underline}

It is certain to stir unease in Washington and Brussels, where officials
are trying to keep Turkey --- a longtime NATO member, and an
increasingly unlikely candidate for European Union membership --- from
entering Russia's sphere of influence.

**[The deal comes as relations between Russia and the West are at a
particularly low point.]{.underline}** Tensions escalated in 2014 when
Russia annexed Crimea and then began fomenting armed revolt in eastern
Ukraine. They have grown still worse as evidence has mounted that Moscow
was behind the hacking of the 2016 election in the United States and
also tried to interfere in other nations' elections.

Although a prospective missile purchase from Russia was made public
several months ago, Mr. [Erdogan's announcement was the first
confirmation that Turkey had transferred money to pay for the missile
system]{.underline}, known as the S-400.

"Signatures have been made for the purchase of S-400s from Russia," Mr.
Erdogan said in comments published in several newspapers on Tuesday. "A
deposit has also been paid as far as I know."

The [purchase of the missile system flies in the face of cooperation
within the NATO alliance,]{.underline} which Turkey has belonged to
since the early 1950s. [NATO]{.underline} does not ban purchases of
military hardware from manufacturers outside the American-led alliance,
but it [does discourage members from buying equipment not compatible
with that used by other members]{.underline}.

A NATO official in Brussels, the headquarters of the alliance, said that
[no NATO member currently operates the Russian missile
system]{.underline} and that the alliance had not been informed about
the details of the purchase by Turkey.

**["What matters for NATO is that the equipment allies acquire is able
to operate together,]{.underline}**" the official said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity as required by alliance procedures.
"[Interoperability of allied armed forces is essential to NATO for the
conduct of our operations."]{.underline}

**[Turkey had earlier planned to buy missiles from China, but that deal
fell through under pressure from the United States]{.underline}**.

[Western arms makers lobbied]{.underline} hard for the expansion of NATO
into former Soviet satellite countries after the collapse of Communism.
They have since lobbied both [new and old NATO member states not to
stray outside the alliance]{.underline} for weapons purchases that would
cut into their business.

Mr. Erdogan dismissed issues of interoperability, brand loyalties or the
geopolitical optics of such a sale. "Nobody has the right to discuss the
Turkish republic's independence principles or independent decisions
about its defense industry," the daily newspaper Hurriyet reported him
as saying.

"We make the decisions about our own independence ourselves," he said.
"We are obliged to take safety and security measures in order to defend
our country."

Mr. Erdogan's announcement --- made to Turkish journalists aboard his
presidential jet as he returned from Kazakhstan --- appeared timed as a
riposte to two judicial cases announced last week in the United States.
One is against his presidential bodyguards, who are charged with
assaulting protesters when Mr. Erdogan visited Washington this year. The
other is against a group of Turks, including a former minister, accused
of breaking United States sanctions against Iran.

Mr. Erdogan has angrily criticized both cases.

Yet [Turkey has other reasons for the missile purchase. It needs to
cultivate good relations with Russia, and it also needs to build its own
military defense]{.underline}, said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the
European Council on Foreign Relations. "Turkey wants the deal," she
said, "and Russia is only too happy to drive a wedge into the NATO
alliance."

NATO's collective defense should be sufficient for Turkey; indeed, NATO
deployed Patriot missiles there during a rise of tensions with Syria in
the past. But Mr. Erdogan has lost trust in the West since last year's
failed coup, which he has interpreted as a Western plot to oust him, and
appears determined to secure his own defense, Ms. Aydintasbas said.

Military and civilian plotters used jets and tanks to try to seize power
last July and bombed several locations, including the Parliament
building, before being faced down by loyalist security forces and public
demonstrations. Mr. Erdogan narrowly evaded capture.

The [transfer of technology from Russia is attractive to
Turkey]{.underline}, Ms. Aydintasbas said. Mr. [Erdogan has spoken also
of his frustration at having requests to the United States for drones
turned down]{.underline}, and of his satisfaction that Turkey developed
its own.

Mr. Erdogan's announcement of the deal with Russia came after Germany
said that it was suspending all major arms exports to Turkey because of
the deteriorating human rights situation in the country and the
increasingly strained ties.

"We have put on hold all big requests that Turkey sent to us, and these
are really not a few," the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said
during a panel discussion in Berlin on Monday, according to Reuters.

[As suspicions toward the West have grown, relations with Russia have
warmed]{.underline}, driven by the personal relationship between Mr.
Erdogan and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Erdogan has
expressed personal admiration for Mr. Putin, to the consternation of
many European and American leaders, if not President Trump.

Mr. Erdogan has also shown a preference for the Russian model, with its
sense of restoring a lost empire, returning Turkey to a more independent
place in the world and rejecting Western democracy.

After a tense falling out in 2015, when Turkish jets shot down a Russian
warplane on Turkey's border with Syria, Mr. Erdogan sought to improve
relations with Russia, sending two letters to Mr. Putin and then
traveling to Moscow for a meeting in June 2016.

His visit represented a marked shift from the Cold War era, when Turkey
was a staunch ally of the West in facing down the Soviet Union. (Turkey
shares a border with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet
republics that remain, to varying degrees, under Russian influence.)
Russian-Turkish rivalry in the Black Sea and the Caucasus dates back
centuries.

Mr. Putin, at odds with the West since he annexed Crimea from Ukraine in
2014, also worked hard to patch up relations with Ankara, seeing in Mr.
Erdogan a like-minded strongman who shares his distrust of meddling by
the West.

The fact that Turkey belongs to NATO, whose unity Moscow has struggled
for years to undermine, has only increased Mr. Putin's desire to forge
strong relations with Mr. Erdogan despite their differences over the
conflict in Syria.

"Mr. Putin and myself are determined on this issue," Mr. Erdogan told
journalists about the missile deal.

Last year, Russia and Turkey reached an agreement to revive a suspended
natural-gas pipeline project.

The [purchase of Russian missiles would take cooperation to a new
level]{.underline}, but is not the first time that Turkey has bought
military equipment from Russia. It turned to Moscow in the early 1990s
to buy military helicopters and armored personnel carriers.

After relations hit a rocky patch over Russia's 1994 war in Chechnya,
however, Turkey disappointed hopes in Moscow that it would become a
major new market for Russian hardware.

[Russia, largely squeezed out of the arms market in Western and Eastern
Europe]{.underline}, even in countries that once bought nearly all their
weapons from the Soviet Union, h[as looked for years to NATO'S eastern
flank as a promising market and the alliance's weakest link. It has also
sold weapons to Greece, another NATO member and to Cyprus, which is not
a member of NATO but houses British military bases and effectively
serves as an outpost of the alliance.]{.underline}

I say this as someone who believes that [the U.S. government and private
sector both have a strong stake in the success of the crown prince's
policy of transforming Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. That is why I have
worked with or advised a variety of organizations [to develop U.S.-Saudi
business interests]{.underline}. The crown prince's [Vision
2030]{.underline} plan did not promise democracy but [did promise
far-reaching social and economic changes]{.underline}. These changes,
particularly those that required discrediting the strict and intolerant
Wahhabi interpretation of Islam --- an interpretation that has exported
and fueled al Qaeda, ISIS and extremism throughout the Middle East and
beyond --- is very much in American interests. Similarly, creating a
successful model of development for the Arab Middle East has long been
needed to counter radical efforts --- whether Islamist or secular ---
that promise progress and justice and always produce the opposite. The
Trump administration may focus less on these factors and more on others:
[our common interests to counter the Iranian determination to dominate
the region, and our economic and business interests in the
kingdom]{.underline}. Its definition of our interests has led the Trump
administration to try to manage the fallout from the Khashoggi killing.
Yes, we have a reason to preserve our relationship with Saudi Arabia.
And, yes, given the reality that the crown prince, known as MbS, may be
effectively running the kingdom for years to come, the administration
must find a way to safeguard our ongoing interests.
