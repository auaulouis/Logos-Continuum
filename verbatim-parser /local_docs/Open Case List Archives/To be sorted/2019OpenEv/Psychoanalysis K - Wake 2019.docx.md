**The performance of radical demands against the state fails**

**LUNDBERG 2012** (Chris, comm studies prof at UNC, Lacan in Public)

The demands of student revolutionaries and antiglobalization protestors
provide a set of opportunities for interrogating hysteria as a po liti
cal practice. For the antiglobalization protestors cited earlier,
demands to be added to a list of dangerous globophobes uncannily
condense a dynamic inherent to all demands for recognition. But the
demands of the Mexico Solidarity Network and the Seattle Independent
Media project demand more than recognition: they also demand danger as a
specific mode of representation. ["Danger" functions as a]{.underline}
sign of something more than inclusion, [a way of reaffirming the
protestors' imaginary agency]{.underline} over processes of
globalization. If danger represents an assertion of agency, and the
assertion of agency is proportional to the deferral of desire to the
master upon whom the demand is placed, then [[demands to be recognized
as dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline} are doubly hysterical. Such demands
[[are]{.mark} also [demands]{.mark}]{.underline} for a certain kind of
love, namely, [[the state might extend its love]{.mark} by recognizing
the dangerousness of the one who makes the demand. At the level the
demand's rhetorical function, [dangerousness is metonymically connected
with]{.mark} [the idea that average citizens]{.mark} can effect
change]{.underline} in the prevailing order, [or]{.underline} that they
might [be recognized as agents who]{.underline}, in the instance of the
list of globalophobic leaders, [can [command the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Mexican [[state]{.mark} to reaffirm their agency by recognizing their
dangerousness. [The rhetorical structure of danger implies the
continuing existence of]{.mark} the [state]{.mark} or governing
apparatus's [interests]{.mark},]{.underline} and these interests become
a nodal point at which the hysterical demand is discharged. This
structure generates enjoyment of the existence of oppressive state
policies as a point for the articulation of identity. The addiction to
the state and the demands for the state's love is also bound up with a
fundamental dependency on the oppression of the state: otherwise the
identity would collapse. Such demands constitute a reaffirmation of a
hysterical subject position: they reaffirm not only the subject's
marginality in the global system but the danger that protestors present
to the global system.

There are three practical implications for this formation.

First, for the hysteric [the simple discharge of the demand is both the
beginning and satisfaction of the political project]{.underline}.
Although there is always a nascent political potential in performance,
in this case [[the performance of demand comes to fully eclipse]{.mark}
the desires that animate [content]{.mark} of the demand]{.underline}.

Second, [[demand allows institutions]{.mark} that stand in for the
global order [to dictate]{.mark} the direction of
[politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not to say that engaging such
institutions is a bad thing; rather, it is to say that [[when
antagonistic engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} with certain institutions
[[is]{.mark}]{.underline} read as [[the end point]{.mark} of politics,
the field of political options is]{.underline} relatively [constrained.
[Demands to be recognized]{.mark} as]{.underline} dangerous by the
Mexican government or as a [powerful]{.underline} antiglobalization
force by the WTO often [[function at the cost of]{.mark}]{.underline}
addressing how practices of globalization are reaffirmed at the level of
consumption, of identity, and so on or in [thinking through alternative
[political strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} for engaging globalization
that do not hinge on the state and the state's actions.

Paradoxically, the third danger is that [an addiction to the refusal of
demands]{.underline} creates a paralyzing disposition toward
institutional politics. Grossberg has identified a tendency in left
politics [**[to retreat from the "politics of
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and public
**[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**."45 Although Grossberg identifies the
problem as a specific coordination of "theory" and its relation to left
politics, perhaps [a]{.underline} hysterical [commitment to marginality
informs the impulse]{.underline} in some sectors [to eschew engagements
with]{.underline} institutions and [institutional debate. [An addiction
to the state's refusal]{.mark} of ten makes the perfect the enemy of the
good, implying a stifling commitment to po liti cal purity as a pretext
for sustaining a structure of enjoyment dependent on
refusal]{.underline}, dependent on a kind of paternal "no." Instead of
seeing institutions and policy making as one part of the political field
that might be pressured for contingent or relative goods,
[a]{.underline} hysterical [politics [is in the]{.mark} incredibly
[difficult position of taking an addressee]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as
the state) [[that]{.mark} it assumes [represents the totality of the
political field; simultaneously it understands its addressee
as]{.mark}]{.underline} constitutively and necessarily [[only a locus of
prohibition]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These paradoxes become nearly insufferable when one makes an analytical
cut between the content of a demand and its rhetorical functionality.
[[At the level of]{.mark} the **[content]{.mark}** of the demand, the
state or [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} that represent globalization
[[are figured as illegitimate]{.mark},]{.underline} as morally and
politically compromised because of their misdeeds. Here there is an
assertion of agency, [[but]{.mark}]{.underline} because [the assertion
of agency is simultaneously a deferral of desire]{.underline}, the
identity produced in [[the]{.mark}]{.underline} hysterical [[demand
is]{.mark}]{.underline} not only intimately tied to but is ultimately
[[dependent on the continuing existence of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
state, [[hegemonic order]{.underline}]{.mark}, or institution. [[At the
level of affective investment, the]{.mark} state or institution is
automatically figured as the legitimate authority over its
domain.]{.underline} As Lacan puts it: "demand in itself . . . is demand
of a presence or of an absence . . . pregnant with that Other to be
situated within the needs that it can satisfy[. [Demand constitutes the
Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying
needs]{.underline}]{.mark}[, that it is to say, the power of depriving
them of that alone by which they are satisfied]{.underline}."46

**Desire is not natural or inevitable---rather, we are taught to desire
by imagining the desire of the Other**

**HEWITSON 2010** (Owen, Middlesex University, Centre for
Psychoanalysis, "What Does Lacan Say About... Desire?," Lacan Online,
May 9,
https://www.lacanonline.com/2010/05/what-does-lacan-say-about-desire/)

There are two relatively straightforward ways in which we can understand
one of Lacan's most well-known maxims, that "Man's [desire is the desire
of the Other]{.underline}"? (Seminar XI, p.235). Firstly, that desire is
essentially a desire for recognition from this 'Other'; secondly that
desire is for the thing that we suppose the Other desires, which is to
say, the thing that the Other lacks.

In commenting on the way that desire repeats and insists through the
transference and the signifier in psychoanalytic work, Lacan verifies
our first reading, that [desire is fundamentally a desire for
recognition]{.underline}:

"The necessary and sufficient reason for the repetitive insistence of
these desires in the transference and their permanent remembrance in a
signifier that repression has appropriated -- that is, in which the
repressed returns -- is found if one accepts the idea that in these
determinations the desire for recognition dominates the desire that is
to be recognised, preserving it as such until it is recognised" (Ecrits,
431).

In other words, desire pushes for recognition. It is less a question of
what we desire as much as it is that we be recognised. Moreover, Lacan
believes that this dependence on the other for recognition is
responsible for structuring not only our desires, but even our drives:

"To return psychoanalysis to a veridical path, it is worth recalling
that analysis managed to go so far in the revelation of man's desires
only by following, in the veins of neurosis and the marginal
subjectivity of the individual, the structure proper to a desire that
thus proves to model it at an unexpected depth -- namely, the desire to
have his desire recognised. This desire, in which it is literally
verified that man's desire is alienated in the other's desire, in effect
structures the drives discovered in analysis, in accordance with all the
vicissitudes of the logical substitutions in their source, aim, and
object" (Ecrits, 343).

So firstly our desire is a desire for recognition. But secondly [it is
also the desire for what we believe the other desires]{.underline}. We
can see this as a consequence of the desire for recognition: [what we
experience as [our own desire is always going to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a certain sense, [[the other's
desire,]{.mark} the other that [we desire recognition
from]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[We can understand this 'other']{.underline} in two ways[[:
first]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as]{.underline} indicated with a lower case
o, [[the other person]{.underline}]{.mark}, our counterpart, our
semblable; [[second]{.mark}, as the]{.underline} Other with a capital O,
a more 'otherly' other, the essential feature of which being that
although we never know quite what their desire is, we are on a constant
quest to find an answer. This [[big Other]{.underline}]{.mark} might be
another person in their essentially enigmatic dimension; or it might be
[the assumed]{.underline} virtues, morals and [ideals of our
culture]{.underline} and upbringing. One of the reasons why it is useful
to put the capital O on this maxim of man's desire being the desire of
the Other is that it renders this 'otherness' of the Other more stark.

We never fully know exactly what the Other desires or why it desires it,
or in what way we ourselves might be implicated. For the subject, desire
is thus a constant process of questioning what the Other has or desires
to have. In an address to the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1951
Lacan sums this up in saying:

"The object of man's desire, and we are not the first to say this, is
essentially an object desired by someone else. One object can become
equivalent to another, owing to the effect produced by this
intermediary, in making it possible for objects to be exchanged and
compared. This process tends to diminish the special significance of any
one particular object, but at the same time it brings into view the
existence of objects without number" (Lacan, 'Some Reflections on the
Ego', International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, 34, 11-17; reproduced in
Furman and Levy (eds), Influential Papers from the 1950s, Karnac, 2003,
p.295 -- 296).

Equally, in the late sixties Lacan says:

"Desire full stop is always the desire of the Other. Which basically
means that [we are always asking the Other what]{.underline} he
[desires]{.underline}" (My Teaching, p.38).

This is the second way to understand the idea of our desire being the
desire of the Other: as a desire for what we think the Other desires or
lacks. So taking these two readings of Lacan's maxim together, the
lesson Lacan has for us is that the consequence of striving for
recognition from the Other is that we can never 'simply' desire. Our
desire is not something innate inside us. Indeed, for Lacan [our desires
are not even our own]{.underline} -- we always have to desire in the
second degree, finding a path to our own desire and our own recognition
by asking the question of what the Other desires. [[We]{.mark} have to
[desire things that are desirable to]{.mark}]{.underline} the Other --
whether [[other people]{.underline}]{.mark} or the Otherness of our
socio-cultural context -- and through that process the desire of the
Other becomes our own. This is an idea that has its heritage in Hegel's
philsophy, as Lacan acknowledges in the Ecrits:

"Man's very desire is constituted, he \[Hegel\] tells us, under the sign
of mediation: it is the desire to have one's desire recognised. Its
object is a desire, that of other people, in the sense that man has no
object that is constituted for his desire without some mediation. This
is clear from his earliest needs, in that, for example, his very food
must be prepared; and we find this anew in the whole development of his
satisfaction, beginning with the conflict between master and slave,
through the entire dialectic of labour" (Ecrits, 182).

To desire is to answer the question 'What does the Other desire?'

However, this does not simply mean that we just identify with the other
and automatically take whatever they desire as our own. Indeed, it is
not always clear what the Other wants. When we call our desires our own
what we really mean is only that we have succeeded in seeking out the
gaps in the desire of the Other, and carving out a space for ourselves
there:

"... It must be posited that, as a characteristic of an animal at the
mercy of language, man's desire is the Other's desire.

This concerns a totally different function than that of primary
identification mentioned above, for it does not involve the assumption
by the subject of the other's insignia, but rather the condition that
the subject find the constitutive structure of his desire in the same
gap opened up by the effect of signifiers in those who come to represent
the Other for him, insofar as his demand is subjected to them" (Ecrits,
628).

Although Lacan's maxim is that man's desire is the desire of the Other,
he does not picture our desires as clones of the Other's. Rather, part
of the job of creating our own subjectivity is to generate some autonomy
between us and the Other, which in the first instance is manifested as
the mother, or motherer. In order for him to become a subject, the
helpless infant must first identify the mother's desire, and then pick a
position in response to it. A baby may get fed when he cries, whether or
not his cry was a cry for food, for warmth, or for a change of nappy.
The most urgent task in the development of his own desire is in coming
up with an answer to the question of what the Other (in this case, his
mother) wants, and seeking for himself a position in respect of that
unfathomable 'x'. Lacan characterises this dilemma in the following way
in Seminar V:

"It is not just frustration as such, namely something more or less in
the real order which has been given or which has not been given to the
subject, which is the important point; it is the way that the subject
has aimed at, has located this desire of the other which is the mother's
desire, and with respect to this desire it is to make him recognise, or
pass, or propose to become with respect to something which is an X of
desire in the mother, to become or not the one who responds, to become
or not the desired being" (Seminar V, 12.03.58., p.3 -4).

In that seminar Lacan introduces the famous graph of desire, and the
paper entitled 'The Subversion of the Subject' in the Ecrits follows on
from the presentation of the graph of desire in Seminar V. Lacan makes
the question of what the (m)Other desires -- 'Che vuoi?', 'What do you
want?' -- a kind of rites of passage for the infant, the answer to which
will give the him a place from where he can answer the same question put
to himself -- what do I desire? Later in life this question might be
echoed in a psychoanalysis as the patient lies on the couch asking
himself what the analyst wants of him. Here is how Lacan puts this in
the paper in the Ecrits:

"This is why the Other's question \[la question de l'Autre\] -- that
comes back to the subject from the place from which he expects an
oracular reply -- which takes some such form as 'Che vuoi?', 'What do
you want?', is the question that best leads the subject to the path of
his own desire, assuming that, thanks to the know-how of a partner known
as a psychoanalyst, he takes up that question, even without knowing it,
in the following form: 'What does he want from me?'

It is this superimposed level of structure that will nudge my graph
\[see Graph 3\] towards its completed form, inserting itself there first
like the outline of a question mark planted in the circle of the capital
A, for Other, symbolising the question it signifies with a disconcerting
collineation" (Ecrits, 814-815).

However, even if he has succeeded in constructing his own desire from
the answer he has given to the question of the Other's desire, the fact
that his desire has been premised on the Other's desire means that
[there will forever be a world of difference between what]{.underline}
he [[desires]{.mark} [and]{.mark} what]{.underline} he [actually
[wants]{.mark}. The two [will **never be in the same place at the same
time**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When the question of what the Other desires
manifests itself, or is brought to the fore, it,

"... Leaves it up to the subject to butt up against the question of his
essence, in that he may not misrecognise that what he desires presents
itself to him as what he does not want -- a form assumed by negation in
which misrecognition is inserted in a very odd way, the misrecognition,
of which he himself is unaware, by which he transfers the permanence of
his desire to an ego that is nevertheless obviously intermittent, and,
inversely, protects himself from his desire by attributing to it these
very intermittences" (Ecrits, 814-815).

[There results a gap between unconscious desire and]{.underline} the
desire of your ego ([what you]{.underline} might be said to
[want]{.underline}), as expressed in demand:

**We begin generate new enemies who must be destroyed**

**STAVRAKAKIS 99** (Yannis Stavrakakis has PhD degrees from the
'Ideology and Discourse Analysis' programme at the University of Essex,
"Lacan and the Political", p.93-94, 10/3/99)

In the light of our theoretical framework, [fantasy can only exist as
the negation of real dislocation]{.underline}, as a negation of the
generalised lack, the antagonism that crosses the field of the social.
Fantasy negates the real by promising to realise it, by promising to
close the gap between the real and reality, by repressing the discursive
nature of reality's production. Yet [any promise of absolute
positivity]{.underline} the construction of an imaginarised false real
[is]{.underline} founded on a [violent]{.underline}/negative origin; it
is [sustained by the exclusion of a]{.underline} real a
[non-domesticated real which always returns to its place]{.underline}.
Sustaining a promise of full positivity leads to a proliferation of
negativity. As we have already pointed out, [[the fantasy of]{.mark}
a]{.underline} utopian [harmonious [social order]{.mark}]{.underline}
can only be sustained if all the persisting disorders can be attributed
to an alien intruder. Since the realisation of the utopian fantasy is
impossible, utopian discourse [[can remain]{.underline}]{.mark}
hegemonically [[appealing only if it attributes]{.underline}]{.mark}
this impossibility that is to say, [[its own]{.underline}]{.mark}
ultimate [[impossibility to an alien intruder]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
Sartre has put it the anti-Semite is in the unhappy position of having a
vital need for the very enemy he wishes to destroy (Sartre, 1995:28).
The impossibility of the Nazi utopia cannot be incorporated within
utopian discourse. This truth is not easy to admit; it is easier to
attribute all negativity to the Jew: All that is bad in society (crises,
wars, famines, upheavals, and revolts) is directly or indirectly
imputable to him. [The anti-Semite]{.underline} is afraid of discovering
that the world is ill- contrived, for then it would be necessary for him
to invent and modify, with the result that man would be found to be the
master of his own destinies, burdened with an agonising and infinite
responsibility. Thus he [localises]{.underline} all [the evil of the
universe in the Jews]{.underline}. (Sartre, 1995:40) 12 As Jerrold Post
has pointed out, we are always bound to those we hate: [[We need enemies
to keep our]{.mark} [treasured]{.mark} and idealised [selves
intact]{.mark}]{.underline} (Post, 1996:28-9). And this for fear of
being free (Sartre, 1995:27). [The fantasy of attaining a perfect
harmonious world]{.underline}, of realising the universal, [can only be
sustained through]{.underline} the construction/localisation of [a
certain [particularity]{.mark} which]{.underline} cannot be assimilated
but, instead, **[[has to be eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There
exists then a crucial dialectic between the universal fantasy of utopia
and the particularity of the always local enemy who is posited as
negating it. [[The result]{.underline}]{.mark} of this dialectic [[is
**always**]{.mark} the same: The tragic paradox of utopianism has been
that instead of bringing about]{.underline}, as it promised, a system of
final and permanent [stability]{.underline}, it gave rise to utter
restlessness, and in place of a reconciliation between human freedom and
social cohesion, [it brought **[totalitarian
coercion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In terms of the symbolic axis of communication then, to reiterate the
point made above, we are concerned with something more than merely
taking another's perspective, which, after all, would not remove us from
the level of imaginary inter- subjectivity. [We cannot,]{.underline} for
example, [imagine a referee, who in order to make a crucial decision,
adopts an empathic posture, and puts him or herself in the subjective
position of one of the players]{.underline} . . . So, [what is often
taken as an ideal of communicative efficacy (or]{.underline} indeed, as
a [rudimentary ethical gesture) -- the attempt to 'see something from
the other's point of view' -- is not necessarily a goal of effective
communicative change]{.underline}. It is likewise, from a Lacanian
perspective at least, decidedly not an ethical ideal. That is to say:
**[there is no easy stepping outside of ego-subjectivity within the
perspective of the ego itself; there is no imaginary assumption of 'how
the other sees it' that succeeds in bracketing one's own
ego]{.underline}**. This paradox should be emphasized: **[the attempt to
'put myself in the shoes of an other' occurs via one's own
ego]{.underline}**, [so the very gesture of empathic inter-subjectivity
really only reaffirms my ego (i.e. the logic here is that of how I think
they see it)]{.underline}. A maxim of Lacanian clinical practice comes
to the fore here: [it is only via the Other, by means of the symbolic
enunciations that patients make, that they and what they are speaking
about]{.underline} (however indirectly) [can be approached in a
(relatively) ego-bracketed fashion]{.underline}.6 Michael Miller (2011)
accordingly stresses that [clinicians should be attuned not to the
inferred content of a patient's discourse, but 'to the letter' of
actually enunciated speech. Such a literal approach]{.underline}, he
stresses, [involves less of a leap of theoretical faith than does an
approach 'which takes as its source the inferred content of the
patient's speech and behaviour]{.underline}' (p. 52). **[Inferring
contents, distilling apparent themes, or making interpretive assumptions
about what patients say, invariably says more about the analyst's own
ego than it does about the patient.]{.underline}** It is for these
reasons that La[canian clinicians remain wary of attempts to see things
from the perspective of others and avoid making assumptions about what
their patients are thinking or feeling. In such instances, the other
becomes all too easily a prop for the (clinician's) ego's own
self-realization]{.underline}.7 Hence the Lacanian critique of
'counter-transference' as a means of interpreting the patient's current
emotional state (i.e. comments such as: 'I am feeling anxious in this
setting, which makes me wonder if you are feeling agitated'). For Lacan
these are at basis ego- centred interpretations that foreground the
clinician's own ego even while claiming access to the other.8

#### Psychoanalytic theory produces its own desire in order to fill the hole of nothingness created by subjectivity. All drives to imperialistically obtain the object fail because they'll never amount to the *objet petit a*.

The politics of the death drive begins with the revolutionary idea of
subjectivity that Freud uncovers: his understanding that [[the subject
doesn't seek knowledge but instead desires]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Following from this idea, the traditional notion of [progress becomes
untenable]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the subject [becomes
self-destructive]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the one hand, earlier thinkers
like Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche anticipate Freud's
revolutionary turn from the subject of knowledge to the subject of
desire. Schopenhauer and Nietzsche emphasize how [[our quest for
knowledge serves as a guise for a more fundamental quest for
satisfaction]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in this way they overturn the
traditional philosophical conception of subjectivity.1 But on the other
hand, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche fail to grasp the signifi cance of
the human animal's entrance into the fi eld of knowledge or language.
For both, will exists on one side and knowledge (or representation) on
the other, and will is nothing but a biological fact. Freud's conception
of desiring subjectivity recognizes that [the subject is the result of
instinct being deformed through its submission to the realm of
knowledge]{.underline}. Though we act on behalf of desire rather than
knowledge, we do so, paradoxically, because our instincts are mediated
by knowledge. Freud's subject, in contrast to Schopenhauer's and
Nietzsche's, never experiences pure biological instincts but rather a
desire that remains unconscious.2 Authentically [prioritizing desire
requires an idea of the unconscious not simply as the site of a will or
instinct associated with human animality but as a radically diff erent
psychic scene fundamentally irreducible to consciousness]{.underline}.
26 Subjectivity For Freud, [the [subject doesn't know its unconscious
desire]{.mark} not because of its failure to grasp its continued
animality but [because unconscious desire gives birth to the subject and
always remains in front of every project of
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. Freud's revolution is a genuine one ---
tied to a unique vision of how subjectivity emerges.3 Th e political
implications of psychoanalytic thought begin with its understanding of
the genesis of subjectivity, an understanding that sets psychoanalysis
apart from other political theorizing of all stripes. The [[foundational
status of loss for the subject entails a politics centered around the
repetition of loss rather than the achievement of the
good]{.underline}]{.mark}. Psychoanalytic thought sees us as condemned
to the repetition of loss, but it aims at freeing us to take up a new
relation to this repetition. Th is new relation is the emancipatory
project of psychoanalytic politics. Initially, as Freud conceives it,
the [human animal is an autoerotic being that has no object
world]{.underline}. [The distinction between self and other]{.underline}
(or subject and object) [is not a fact of birth but a psychical
achievement]{.underline}. The infant's autoerotic mode does not yet
differentiate between itself and objects, and the being finds some
degree of satisfaction in its undifferentiated existence. This
autoeroticism is not yet even narcissism. The narcissistic relationship
of the subject with its own ego requires the formation of an ego, which
can only form through a break in the autoerotic circuit. As Freud puts
it in "On Narcissism: An Introduction," "A unity comparable to the ego
cannot exist in the individual from the start; the ego has to be
developed. Th e auto-erotic instincts, however, are there from the very
first; so there must be something added to auto-eroticism --- a new
psychical action --- in order to bring about narcissism."4 Because the
ego is just a special sort of object (one that competes with other
objects for the subject's libido), it can form and the subject can
become narcissistic only after the subject has created the division
between subject and object. This creative act --- what Freud calls "[a
new psychical action]{.underline}" --- [produces a division out of the
undifferentiated autoeroticism of the human animal. [The subject]{.mark}
as such [emerges through the experience of
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[It is]{.mark} the loss of a part
of the subject --- [an initial act of sacrifice]{.mark} --- [that
creates both subject and object]{.mark}, the object emerging through
this act as what the subject has lost of itself]{.underline}. [[The
subject takes an interest in the object world because it forms this
world around its lost object]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Jacques Lacan
notes, "Never, in our concrete experience of analytic theory, do we do
without the notion of 27 The Formation of Subjectivity the lack of the
object as central. It is not a negative, but the very spring for the
relation of the subject to the world."5 The loss of the object generates
a world around this loss to which the subject can relate. Obviously, no
one literally creates objects through an initial act of sacrifice of an
actual body part. This would be too much to ask. But the psychical act
of sacrifice allows for a distinction to develop where none existed
before and simultaneously directs the subject's desire toward the object
world. In his breakthrough essay "Negation," Freud describes this
process as follows: "Th e antithesis between subjective and objective
does not exist from the fi rst. It only comes into being from the fact
that thinking possesses the capacity to bring before the mind once more
something that has once been perceived, by reproducing it as a
presentation without the external object having still to be there. [The
fi rst and immediate aim, therefore, of reality-testing is, not to fi nd
an object in real perception which corresponds to the one presented, but
to refind such an object, to convince oneself that it is still
there]{.underline}."6 Th ough Freud doesn't use terms from linguistics,
it is clear that he is making reference to the subject's alienation in
language and that he sees this alienation as the key to the emergence of
both the subject and the object. [When the subject submits to the
imperatives of language, it enters into an indirect relation with the
object world. Th e speaking being does not relate to books, pencils, and
paper but to "books," "pencils," and "paper." Th e signifi er intervenes
between the subject and the object that the subject perceives. [Th e
subject's alienation into language deprives it of immediate contact with
the object world]{.mark}.]{.underline} And yet, in the above passage
from "Negation," Freud conceives [of the subject's entrance into
language ---]{.underline} its "[capacity to bring before the mind once
more something that has once been perceived, by reproducing it as a
presentation without the external object having still to be
there]{.underline}" --- as the event that produces the very distinction
between subject and object. Th is means that the indirectness or
mediation introduced by language deprives the subject of a direct
relation to the object world that it never had. Prior to its immersion
in the mediation of language, the subject had no object at all --- not a
privileged relation to objects but a complete absence of relationality
as such due to its autoeroticism. In this sense, [the subject's
willingness to accede to its alienation in language is the fi rst
creative act, a sacrifi ce that produces the objects that the subject
cannot directly access]{.underline}. Language is important not for its
own sake but because it is the site of our 28 Subjectivity founding
sacrifi ce. We know that the subject has performed this act of sacrifice
when we witness the subject functioning as a being of language, but the
sacrifi ce is not an act that the subject takes up on its own. [Others
always impose the entry into language on the subject. Th eir
exhortations and incentives to speak prompt the emergence of the
speaking subject]{.underline}. But the subject's openness to alienation
in language, its willingness to sacrifi ce a part of itself in order to
become a speaking subject, suggests a lack in being itself prior to the
entry into language. Th at is, the act through which the subject cedes
the privileged object and becomes a subject coincides with language but
is irreducible to it. [[The subject engages in the act of sacrifi ce
because]{.underline}]{.mark} it does not fi nd its initial autoeroticism
perfectly satisfying --- [[the unity of the autoerotic being is not
perfect]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and this lack of complete
satisfaction produces the opening through which language and society
grab onto the subject through its alienating
process]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If the initial autoerotic state of the
human animal were perfectly satisfying, no one would begin to speak, and
subjectivity would never form]{.underline}. Speaking as such testifi es
to an initial wound in our animal being and in being itself. But
subjectivity emerges only out of a self-wounding. Even though others
encourage the infant to abandon its autoerotic state through a multitude
of inducements, the initial loss that constitutes subjectivity is always
and necessarily self-infl icted. Subjectivity has a fundamentally
masochistic form, and it continually repeats the masochistic act that
founds it. [Th e act of sacrifi ce opens the door to the promise of a
satisfaction that autoerotic isolation forecloses, which is why the
incipient subject abandons the autoerotic state and accedes to the call
of sociality]{.underline}. But the term "sacrifi ce" is misleading
insofar as it suggests that the subject has given up a wholeness (with
itself or with its parent) that exists prior to being lost. [[In the act
of sacrifi ce, the incipient subject gives up something that it doesn't
have]{.underline}]{.mark}. Th e initial loss that founds subjectivity is
not at all substantial; [[it is the ceding of
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Th rough this defi ning gesture, the
subject sacrifi ces its lost object into being]{.underline}. But if the
subject cedes nothing, this initial act of sacrifi ce seems profoundly
unnecessary. Why can't the subject emerge without it? Why is the
experience of loss necessary for the subject to constitute itself qua
subject? Th e answer lies in the diff erence between need and desire.
[While the needs of the human animal are not dependent on the experience
of loss, the subject's desires are]{.underline}. 29 The Formation of
Subjectivity [It is the initial act of sacrifice that gives birth to
desire:]{.underline} [the subject sacrifi ces nothing in order to create
a lost object around which it can organize its
desire]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Richard Boothby puts it in his
unequaled explanation of the psychoanalytic conception of the emergence
of desire, "Th e destruction and loss of the object . . . opens up a
symbolic dimension in which what was lost might be recovered in a new
form."7 He adds: "Sacrifi ce serves to constitute the very matrix of
desire. Th e essential function of sacrifi ce is less do ut des, I give
so that you might give, than do ut desidero: I give in order that I
might desire."8 [[Th e subject's desire is oriented around this lost
object, but the object is nothing as a positive entity and only exists
insofar as it is lost. Th is is why one can never attain the lost object
or the object that causes one to desire]{.mark}.]{.underline}9 Th e
coming-into-being of this object originates the subject of desire, but,
having no substance, the object can never become an empirical object of
desire. [[We may see an object of desire as embodying the lost object,
but whenever we obtain this object, we discover its
emptiness.]{.underline} **[Th e lost object is constitutively rather
than empirically lost]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Eating
Nothing In this light, we can see the anorexic as the model for all
desiring subjectivity. Most cultural critics justifi ably see anorexia
as the product of oppressive defi nitions of femininity that abound in
contemporary society and force women to starve themselves in order to fi
t the ideals of feminine beauty. According to Naomi Wolf 's classic
popular account in Th e Beauty Myth, the ideal of thinness became a way
of controlling women --- disciplining their bodies --- aft er the idea
of natural female inferiority began to evanesce.10 Th e anorexic
embodies female victimization: she has internalized a patriarchal ideal
and does violence to her own body in order to live up to this ideal. But
the problem with this analysis is that the anorexic doesn't just try to
embody the ideal of feminine beauty.11 She goes too far in her pursuit
of thinness and comes to inhabit a body far from the ideal. Even when
everyone tells her that she no longer looks good, that she is too thin,
the anorexic continues to lose weight. It is for this reason that many
feminists have seen her as a subversive fi gure. As Elizabeth Grosz puts
it, "Neither a 'disorder' of the ego nor, as popular opinion has it, a
'dieting disease' gone out of control, anorexia can, like the phantom
limb, be a kind of mourning 30 Subjectivity for a pre-Oedipal (i.e.,
pre-castrated) body and a corporeal connection to the mother that women
in patriarchy are required to abandon. Anorexia is a form of protest at
the social meaning of the female body."12 Grosz accounts for the
excessiveness of anorexia by aligning it with feminist resistance to
patriarchy rather than obsequious submission to it. But she aligns the
anorexic with wholeness and the maternal bond rather than with the lost
object. In this sense, she misses the true radicality of the anorexic, a
radicality that stems from the power of the anorexic's desire. Th e
anorexic doesn't simply refuse to eat but eats nothing, the nothing that
is the lost object. While all positive forms of food fail to address the
subject's lack, nothing does speak to the subject's desire and allows
that desire to sustain itself. Th e anorexic starves not because she
can't fi nd, in the mode of Kafk a's hunger artist, any food that would
satisfy her but because she has found a satisfying food, a food that
nourishes the desiring subject rather than the living being. Th e logic
of anorexia lays bare the hidden workings of desire that operate within
every subject. [[Subjects believe that they pursue various objects of
desire]{.mark} (a new car, a new house, a new romantic partner, and so
on) [and that these objects have an intrinsic attraction, but the real
engine for their desire resides in the nothing that the subject has
given up and that every object tries and fails to
represent]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Objects]{.mark} of desire are
desirable only insofar as they [attempt to represent the impossible lost
object]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is what the anorexic reveals. Still,
the anorexic is exceptional; most nonanorexic subjects imagine that
their lost object can be found in something rather than nothing. Despite
its resonances with the structure of desire, anorexia cannot be
dissociated from the imposition of the ideal of thinness as a mode of
controlling female subjectivity. Th ough this ideal distorts the
anorexic's relationship to her own body, it also renders the nature of
desire itself apparent. Th e impossible ideal of perfect thinness allows
the anorexic subject to avow, albeit unconsciously, the structural
impossibility of desire itself. Unlike male subjects (or other female
subjects who manage to distance themselves from the ideal), the anorexic
cannot avoid confronting the impossibility of her object. Th e
oppressive ideal of perfect thinness allows the anorexic to bear witness
with her body to the truth of desire.13 [Understanding [the]{.mark}
[impossible nature of the lost object]{.mark}]{.underline} --- what the
anorexic makes clear --- [[allows us to rethink the nature of the
political ac]{.underline}t.]{.mark} [**[Rather than being the successful
achievement of some object]{.mark}, the accomplishment of some social
good, [the political act involves insisting on one's desire in the face
of its impossibility, which is precisely what occurs in the death
drive.]{.mark} [The key to a politics of the death drive is
grasping]{.mark}**, in the fashion of the anorexic[, **the nothingness
of the object and thereby finding satisfaction in the drive
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[But the subject's relationship to its
object inherently creates an illusion that makes this possibility almost
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Though the lost object that
initiates subjectivity has no substance, its status for the subject
belies its nothingness.]{.underline}** For the subject, [[the]{.mark}
originary [lost object]{.mark} is the object that [seems to hold the key
to the subject's very ability to enjoy]{.mark}. Subjects invest the lost
object with the idea of their own completion: [the loss of the object
retroactively causes a prior state of completion to arise]{.mark}
[---]{.mark} [a state of completion that never actually existed --- and
the object itself bears the promise of inaugurating a return to this
imaginary prior state]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}14 In short, [it
promises to fi ll in the subject's lack and answer its
desire]{.underline}. As a result of this investment on the part of the
subject, [the initial lost object becomes the engine for all the
subject's subsequent desiring]{.underline}. Without the initial act of
sacrifice, the would-be subject neither desires nor enjoys but instead
suff ocates in a world of self-presence, a self-presence in which one
has no freedom whatsoever. [Th rough the loss of the privileged object,
one frees oneself from the complete domination]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} (parental or social) [authority by creating a lack that
no authority can fi ll. Ceding the object is thus the founding act of
subjectivity and the fi rst free act]{.underline}. **[[Every subsequent
effort by authority to give the subject what it lacks will come up
short]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- or, more correctly, will go too far,
**[[because only nothing can fill the gap within the
subject]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For this reason, **[[dissatisfaction and
disappointment are correlative with freedom: when we experience the
authority's failure to give us what we want, at that moment we also
experience our distance from the authority and our radical freedom as
subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Nostalgia stains the political goal with a false image of a nonlacking subjectivity---it's a political tool that never follows through

[Even though loss is a constitutive experience that founds the subject
in its relation to the]{.underline} object[, this initial [loss misleads
us into believing that we have lost something substantial]{.mark}. We
often fail to see that [we have lost nothing and that our lost object is
simply the embodiment of this nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [belief
in the substantiality of the lost object fuels the prevalence of
nostalgia as a mode of relating to our origins. We dream of recovering
the object and restoring the complete enjoyment that we believe
ourselves]{.mark}]{.underline} to have once had prior to the experience
of loss. This enjoyment never existed, and the recovery of the object,
though it may bring some degree of pleasure, always brings
disappointment as well, which is why sustaining our feeling of nostalgia
depends on not realizing the return to the past that the nostalgic
subject longs for. By insisting that loss is constitutive for the
subject, psychoanalytic thought works to combat nostalgia and its
poisoning of contemporary politics. [[Nostalgia permits us to avoid
seeing the necessity of the link between enjoyment and
loss]{.underline}]{.mark}. Seen in a nostalgic light, **[[enjoyment
gains a purity that it can never actually have]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[It becomes an experience that completes the subject and provides
plenitude rather than an experience that derives from the subject's
partiality and lack. The false image of enjoyment that nostalgia
portrays is the source of its widespread appeal. As subjects, we
constantly turn ourselves toward both our individual past and our
collective cultural history in an att empt to fi nd what we have
lost.]{.underline} The story of Eden, the origin myth of Judeo-Christian
society, reveals dramatically the privileged place of nostalgia in our
society. While the doctrine of original sin attempts to represent the
necessity of an original loss, the account of humanity's expulsion from
the Garden of Eden counterbalances this doctrine with an image of lost
perfection. Prior to the act of eating the fruit from the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil, humanity had a direct relation to its
privileged object. One could enjoy in the Garden of Eden without
restraint. This particular origin myth has the power that it does
because it ties in with the subject's self-deception that emanates from
its experience of original loss. Th e very experience of loss prompts us
to believe that we have lost something, and the Eden myth fi lls in the
content of what we have lost. If we accept the Eden myth (even as a
metaphor), [[we explicitly affirm ourselves as subjects of nostalgia,
subjects who have lost something rather than nothing. But this mode of
subjectivity goes far beyond our ideas about
creation]{.mark}.]{.underline} It manifests itself in the privileging of
the words of the Founding Fathers in political discourse, the power of
fashion trends that mimic earlier eras, and the popularity of historical
dramas in the cinema. To take just the last example, spectators go to
films like Braveheart (Mel Gibson, 1995), Saving Private Ryan (Steven
Spielberg, 1998), and Cinderella Man (Ron Howard, 2005) because they
depict the past as a heroic time when people had an 41 The Formation of
Subjectivity ability to enjoy directly the privileged object. Even
though William Wallace (Mel Gibson) dies in his fi ght for freedom in
Braveheart, he nonetheless has the appearance of a nonlacking subject, a
subject defined by his wholeness rather than his loss. Th e image of
this wholeness on the screen appeals to spectators' nostalgia for what
they believe they once had. [Nostalgia reaches into almost every aspect
of contemporary culture, even those places where it appears to be most
absent]{.underline}. The contemporary idealization of the child seems on
the surface to indicate a rejection of nostalgia, an investment in the
future rather than the past. In No Future, his superb account of this
phenomenon, Lee Edelman criticizes the cult of the child for precisely
this reason. He sees the privileging of the child as part of a
heterosexist ideology oriented toward the future and toward the
reproduction of an oppressive social order. He claims: "Th e Child has
come to embody for us the telos of the social order and come to be seen
as the one for whom that order is held in perpetual trust."32 For
Edelman, the image of the child predominates as a result of our need to
believe in a better future. What he doesn't address fully is the psychic
source of this image's power. We idealize the child not simply because
it embodies our hope for the future but primarily because it provides us
with a look at what we believe we have lost. Th e innocent child appears
to be nonlacking, not subject to loss. When we devote ourselves to the
image of the child, we affirm an image of our own lost completeness.
Belief in the purity of the child is the positing of our own lost
purity. We fi nd violence against children so much more abhorrent than
violence against adults because of this association of childhood with a
lost purity. In the United States, Megan's Law (rendering public the
addresses of those convicted of sexual offenses with children), the
Amber Alert (a public emergency broadcast in response to the abduction
of a child), and many other similar programs have emerged out of the
nostalgic belief that the child is a nonlacking being and that violence
against the child thus represents the ultimate crime --- the destruction
of innocent wholeness.33 It is nostalgia that gives the image of the
child the power that it has over us. As we bow down to this image, we
avoid seeing the constitutive role that loss plays in the experience of
even the youngest child. Th rough an illusion of perspective, the child
appears uncorrupted by the trauma of existence. We can believe in a
complete satisfaction, which is what companies and charitable
organizations off er us when they use the image of the child in their
marketing campaigns. Th is image is successful as a marketing tool
because it partakes in the nostalgia that defines our relation to loss.
[[The prevalence of nostalgia has]{.mark} perhaps [its most obvious
impact in the shaping of contemporary political
programs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Th e entirety of the contemporary
right-wing social and cultural agenda has its basis in the nostalgia for
a time of plenitude. Nostalgia fuels the demand for school prayer, the
opposition to gay marriage, the eff ort to eliminate abortion, the
support for the death penalty, and so on. According to contemporary
American conservatism, the abandonment of school prayer, for instance,
has helped to bring about many of the social ills (teen pregnancy,
school violence, incivility, etc.) that plague contemporary American
society. Champions of school prayer see the epoch when students prayed
in school as time prior to loss. [At]{.underline} this [earlier
historical moment, subjects enjoyed a direct relation with their
privileged object and achieved a perfect satisfaction]{.underline}.
**[[We exist in the aftermath of a fall, and from the perspective of the
fall, we can see the possibilities for complete satisfaction in the
world we have lost]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similarly, eliminating the
threat of gay marriage allows conservatives to imagine a time when
marriage itself was a pure institution, a bond that permitted a direct
link to one's object. **[Within the nostalgia framework that
conservatism offers, [loss has a place only as a limit to overcome
through the return to a nonlacking past]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Conservatism cannot admit the notion of a constitutive or necessary
loss. **[Though right-wing political activity is unthinkable without
nostalgia, emancipatory politics oft en succumbs to its power as
well.]{.underline}** Within certain forms of environmentalism, the
alternative medicine campaign, and the antiglobalization movement, we
can see prominent examples of this. In each case,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} left ist [[political
goal]{.underline}]{.mark} --- protecting the environment, providing
people more health options, countering global capitalism --- [[becomes
intertwined with the idea of a return to an earlier epoch and to a less
alienated way of relating to the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Implicit
in this idea is the image of a nonlacking subjectivity, and this image
stains the political goal with the tint of
nostalgia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those who argue for a return to harmony
with nature, for privileging non-Western and homeopathic forms of
medicine, and for forsaking global capitalism by supporting only local
producers all take up a politics of nostalgia. **[[The idea that we
might return to a stable relation with the natural world posits a prior
time in which this stability existed, a time lost with the onset of
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [By appealing to the inherent
nostalgia of subjects, the forces of emancipation undoubtedly gain
adherents]{.underline}. Many people drawn to the idea of "buying local"
would not otherwise find common cause with emancipatory projects, for
instance. But the long-term cost of this strategy is not worth the
supporters that it wins for the emancipatory politics. Th ough
conservatism doesn't have a monopoly on nostalgia, nostalgia does have
an inherently conservative structure to it. [Nostalgia is fundamentally
conservative insofar as it works to obscure the gap within the social
order]{.underline}. [It posits the possibility of an order that works
without interruption and thus leaves no room for subjectivity
itself]{.underline}. [The freedom of the subject depends on the
imperfection of the social order, its inability to achieve completion or
harmony]{.underline}. [**[A political philosophy that represses]{.mark}
this [failure also inherently represses the opening through which
freedom emerges]{.mark}**. In eff ect, the nostalgic subject longs to
access a past prior to its subjectivization]{.underline}. To retreat
into nostalgia is to fl ee one's own freedom. [In order to accomplish
this and to close the gap within the social order, [nostalgic projects
necessarily rely on a strong authority fi gure who promises to
reinvigorate the lost past rather than on the freedom of the
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}[.[The emancipatory goal placed in a
nostalgic appeal loses touch with the overall emancipatory project of
freeing the subject from its submission to authority fi
gures]{.underline}]{.mark}. What's more, **[[nostalgia works only in
theory, not in practice]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nostalgic appeals always
create disappointment in the last instance. We long for a time before
loss, but this time only comes into existence with its loss: the birth
of subjectivity retroactively creates the object that it loses. **[[Th e
politics of nostalgia involves never actually following through on the
nostalgic promise, as contemporary]{.underline}]{.mark}** conservatism's
**[[social politics make]{.underline}]{.mark}**s
**[[evident]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In contrast to their vigorous
pursuit of a conservative economic program, Ronald Reagan and George W.
Bush (the two great proponents of a politics of nostalgia in the last fi
ft y years) did not actively try to enact their social agenda. For
Reagan and Bush, the [[dream of a return has a political eff ectiveness
that an actual return could not have]{.mark}.]{.underline} If school
prayer again became the norm in public classrooms, the nonexistence of
the former wholeness would be revealed. If the threat of the gay
lifestyle were really eliminated, the banality of heterosexual marriage
would once again show itself. [[Nostalgia remains a useful political
tool only insofar as one doesn't effectuate it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Th
is is the limit of its power.

#### Disruption caused by the symptom is ultimately the only source of happiness---only the failure in obtaining the *objet petit a* allows for satisfaction rather than the object of desire

**McGowan 2013** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television

Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013\] // afre

Typical neurotics enter into analysis believing in their
dissatisfaction. They complain of a symptom --- insomnia, say --- that
functions as a barrier to their enjoyment. They view the analyst as a
subject supposed to know, that is, as a subject who knows the secret of
the symptom. Through the transmission of this knowledge, neurotics hope
to overcome their symptom and become able to freely enjoy themselves
without this hindrance. Th rough the duration of a neurosis, symptoms
serve as a source of satisfaction for the neurotic. Analysis emerges as
a possibility only when this satisfaction becomes too troublesome, when
the symptom begins to debilitate the neurotic and intrude on all aspects
of the neurotic's life. What neurotics don't see, however, is the
satisfaction that the disruptiveness of the symptom offers. Th e goal of
analysis does not consist in eliminating this disruptiveness but in
changing the subject's relationship to it. [Rather than seeing the
disruptiveness of the symptom as the barrier to a truly satisfying life,
the subject must come to grasp this disruptiveness as the source of the
subject's satisfaction]{.underline}. Th e relationship between
psychoanalytic thought and the symptom marks the former's most dramatic
point of rupture from forms of healing (including both other kinds of
therapy and medicine). When patients come to their doctors exhibiting a
symptom, doctors ideally attempt to treat the underlying illness in
order to eliminate the symptom. Th e symptom is valuable for the doctor
insofar as it provides an indication of the underlying illness that can
be addressed. For psychoanalytic thought, the symptom is the indication
of an underlying disorder, but at the same time it coalesces the
subject's psychic existence. [Th e symptom is the disruption of the
circuit that the death drive follows, but its disruptiveness constitutes
the circuit]{.underline}. Without the symptom's disruption of the
circuit, there would be no drive at all; we would have a living organism
rather than a desiring subject.8 [Th e symptom marks a point of excess
at which the subject cannot conduct business as usual. It emerges out of
the subject's failure to realize its desire: the subject develops a
symptom]{.underline} --- aphasia, say --- [in response to an unfi lled
lack]{.underline}, an inability to say the right thing to a love object.
[Th ough the failure]{.underline} marks the point at which the subject
misses something, it [becomes the point through which the subject enjoys
itself]{.underline}. Because there is no possibility for success in
relation to the object, [the subject can fi nd satisfaction only through
its specifi c mode of failure.]{.underline} [Through the symptomatic
failure, the subject relates to its lost object, and this failure is the
only possible vehicle for doing so]{.underline}. It is not as if the
symptom is a poor substitute for a true relation to the object. **[The
subject's failure is its form of success, and the trouble that the
disruptiveness of the symptom gives the subject defines the subject as
such.]{.underline}** Every subject has a fundamental symptomatic
disruption that serves as the foundation for subjectivity itself.9 Th e
elimination of this disruption would not produce a normal subject able
to enjoy itself but would result in the annihilation of the subject
itself (and its capacity for enjoyment). **[By simultaneously showing
the subject that the disruption of the symptom is not the barrier to
enjoyment but the source of it and that there is no normal symptomless
path to enjoyment, psychoanalysis frees the subject to fi nd
satisfaction through the subject's symptomatic disruption rather than
continuing to view the disruption as the obstacle to the ultimate
satisfaction that the subject is constantly missing]{.underline}**. This
is not to say that psychoanalysis simply condemns the insomniac to
perpetual sleeplessness that must be enjoyed rather lamented. Instead,
with the aid of psychoanalysis, the obsessional who views insomnia as
the barrier to a satisfying life comes to recognize the satisfaction
that it actually off ers. Th e subject realizes that it will not lose
the satisfaction att ached to this disruption if it falls asleep,
because the disruption is constitutive of the subject's very
subjectivity. As a result, the subject can begin to enjoy while once
again gett ing to sleep. By facilitating this transformation,
psychoanalysis economizes the trajectory of the death drive. A similar
kind of economizing is at work in almost all of Toni Morrison's novels,
though it is especially pronounced in later works like Love.10 In this
novel Morrison depicts two women who have lived together most of their
adult lives despite hating each other. Christine and Heed are related
through their bond with Bill Cosey, who is Christine's grandfather and
Heed's husband, though Christine and Heed are the same age. Heed's
marriage to Bill when she was eleven years old drove a permanent wedge
between Christine and her, though they had been close friends. Aft er
the marriage, each experiences the other as a symptom, as the barrier to
satisfaction, an indication that she has failed to have Bill Cosey for
herself. Aft er Bill's death, the women continue to live together in his
house because each provides enjoyment for the other through her role as
symptom, though neither can recognize this. At the end of the novel,
Christine and Heed return to an abandoned hotel that Bill owned and that
they hadn't visited for years. While they are investigating it, Heed
falls down some stairs and mortally injures herself. As she lies dying,
she and Christine transform in each other's eyes. Th ey both begin to
see the other as the source of their enjoyment rather than as a barrier
to it. Or they are able to see that they enjoy the barrier to the
desired object rather than the desired object on the other side of the
barrier. In the final moments of Heed's life, she is able, like Sethe in
Beloved, to embrace and enjoy her symptom, thereby passing through a
transformation akin to the one off ered by psychoanalysis. Finally
expressing her aff ection for Christine, Heed begins to economize the
path of the drive and to recognize her mode of enjoyment as her own
instead of fl eeing from it. Like the individual symptom, the social
symptom also appears as a barrier to enjoyment while in fact marking the
very possibility of it. As many theorists have noted, for capitalist
society, the fi gure of the Jew is the symptom that appears to throw the
capitalist system out of balance. (Because it is a fi gure above all,
any social identity can occupy the symptomatic position that the Jew
usually occupies. Th ough historically it was primarily actual Jews who
were in this position, one of the great ironies of contemporary society
is that the Palestinian can serve as the fi gure of the Jew, though it
is most oft en the immigrant.) According to Slavoj Žižek, "Th e
anti-Semitic capitalist's hatred of the Jew \[is\] the hatred of the
excess that pertains to capitalism itself, i.e., of the excess produced
by its inherent antagonistic nature."11 Th e excesses att ributed to the
fi gure of the Jew are the excesses of the system itself, but the belief
nonetheless arises that capitalism without excess is possible. Th is
belief in capitalism without excess fi nds its political expression in
Fascism, which att empts to eliminate the excess embodied by the fi gure
of the Jew. Fascist ideology singles out the fi gure of the Jew for its
opprobrium not as a matt er of historical contingency but because this
fi gure is the symptom of capitalism itself. The figure of the Jew is
capitalism run amok, and Fascist ideology posits that the removal of
this fi gure will restore balance to the capitalist system and make
possible the coexistence of the constant innovation of capitalist
development and the stability of traditional society. Of course, the
Fascist program for the elimination of the fi gure of the Jew stumbles
over the inherent imbalance within capitalism. Th e successful
extirpation of this fi gure doesn't create a balanced capitalism, and
the result is that the Fascist project can never succeed and can never
end. Fascism cannot countenance the elimination of the fi gure that it
works to eliminate. Th e enduring nature of the fi gure of the Jew ---
its persistence even aft er the eradication of actual Jews --- testifi
es to the role that this fi gure plays in the subject's enjoyment. Th e
Fascist subject sees the fi gure of the Jew as the ultimate barrier to
its own enjoyment, which creates the exigency behind the project of
eliminating this fi gure. What psychoanalysis makes clear is that, as in
the case of the neurotic, the Fascist actually derives enjoyment from
this barrier. Rather than blocking enjoyment, the fi gure of the Jew
enables it. As the symptom of capitalism, the excess point in the
structure, the fi gure of the Jew embodies the enjoyment of the system
itself.12 By pursuing the destruction of this fi gure, the Fascist is
actually accessing this enjoyment and taking part in it. Th e only
reason that the destruction of the fi gure of the Jew provides enjoyment
for Fascists is the position that this fi gure occupies as a symptom of
capitalism. But like neurotics, Fascists take an indirect route to their
enjoyment. Th ey are unable to see the fi gure of the Jew as the source
of their enjoyment rather than as an obstacle to it. Th ey are satisfi
ed subjects, but they give themselves too much trouble for their
satisfaction. Freud fi nds in the neurotic not dissatisfaction but a
satisfaction that comes with too much trouble. In Seminar XI Lacan
claims that this is, in fact, the driving force behind the entire
psychoanalytic project: "It is this too much trouble that is the sole
justifi cation of our intervention."13 In other words, the intervention
has nothing to do with alleviating dissatisfaction but with changing the
way in which the analysand relates to her or his satisfaction. Neurotics
come to Freud believing themselves dissatisfi ed. But this is a refl
ected dissatisfaction: they are, though they usually aren't aware of it,
dissatisfi ed with their satisfaction. Th ey are seeking some other way
of arriving at it, because they fail to recognize it as satisfaction. In
response, Freud att empts to produce a change in position relative to
this satisfaction. [Th e neurotic mistakes the experience of the death
drive for the experience of desire, and psychoanalysis att empts to
reveal the drive where the neurotic mistakenly sees desire]{.underline}.
[We misrecognize satisfaction as dissatisfaction because we imagine, in
our present state of lack, that we once had a completeness that we have
now lost.]{.underline} Th at is to say, we believe that our privileged
object once had a substantial existence and fail to see that it became a
privileged object through the very act of being lost. [Th is
misrecognition allows us to continue to believe in a previous and
possible future completeness]{.underline}. Th ough it is neurotic, [this
misrecognition is inherent in the very nature of desire, and it is
through this fundamental misrecognition that desire fi rst begins and
later sustains itself]{.underline}. Desire constantly seeks out the
object that would satisfy it, but this object always eludes it --- or,
to be more precise, [desire eludes the object]{.underline}, [keeping
desire]{.underline} perpetual (and [perpetually dissatisfi
ed]{.underline}). [Desire, in other words, doesn't att empt to achieve
satisfaction but to sustain itself as desire, to keep desire
going]{.underline}. Th is is why [desire constantly seeks out a
satisfying object and yet never quite gets it]{.underline}. It leads us
to see ourselves as dissatisfied and to fail to see the satisfaction we
obtain from the circulation of the drive. [Desire is nothing but a
misrecognition of the death drive]{.underline}.14

LUNDBERG 2012 (Chris, comm studies prof at UNC, Lacan in Public)

Paradoxically, these two facets of human life are intensely
complementary. The failure of unicity necessitates imagined unicity to
purchase the coherence of a subject's reality. Alternately, imagined
unicities are the precondition for recognizing the failure of unicity,
because **[unicity's failure]{.underline}** only **[becomes apparent
when the hard facts of the Real run up against our
fantasies]{.underline}**. Subjects and their discourses emerge at this
nexus of failed and feigned unicity through rhetorical artifice, via the
act of imagining and performing localized, contingent unicities in
response to unicity's failure. Thus, Lacan's psychoanalysis "reads all
speech" and, by extension, the discourses that constitute a subject "as
a compromise formation."8 Failures of unicity in speech, subject, and
the sign are put to work as forces that call forth our investment in the
supplements, fantasies, and imagined totalities that work to cover over
failed unicity: instead of becoming fatal in the life of speech and the
speaking subject, failures in unicity become the driving forces that
animate human existence.

Thus, a provisional definition of rhetoric as a compromise formation:
rhetoric is both signifying in a condition of failed unicity and a way
of feigning unicity in the context of failed unicity. Failed unicity
means, for example, that despite a subject's expectation that the social
world should function as a coherent whole, this condition does not
inhere in its experiences of the interhuman world. Similarly, despite
the subject's presumption of an [essential
**complementarity**]{.underline} between language and the world, there
is no automatic correspondence between signifiers, representations, and
the objects to which they refer or between signifiers and that which
they attempt to capture. Feigned unicity means that discourse is a
contingently situated act of labor connecting signifiers and
representations with their referents and providing the illusion of
communion between subjects and their others. Feigned unicity between
signs, representations, and their referents purchases the subject an
ability to act as if words and representations effortlessly stand in for
their referents. **[Feigned unicity]{.underline}** also **[imagines a
unified social field, despite the subject's experience of a fragmented
social world]{.underline}**. Failed unicity invites feigned unicity in
the **[form]{.underline}** of **[artificial practices that bind
signifiers together]{.underline}**, **[habitually repeat the presumption
of the signifier's correspondence with the world external to it, and
render signifiers communicable.]{.underline}** Rhetorical
artifice---tropes, modes of address, imaginary commitments, and the
labor of investment--- underwrites these practices, feigning unicity in
the context of its failure. Rhetoric affords Lacan's psychoanalysis an
account of the means by which **[feigned unicity underwrites the
speaking subject, the idea of a shared communicative relationship and
correspondence between discourse and the world. Simultaneously, Lacan's
theory of rhetoric marks the fact that unicity fails because there is a
world of things, forces, and relations that lie beyond the limits of
rhetoric's ability to encode or capture them without
remainder.]{.underline}** If **[there is no ultimate point of
unicity]{.underline}**---if **[there is no transparent reciprocal
intersubjective bond that unites subjects in
communication]{.underline}** and no natural correspondence between signs
and the world---there are at least tropes and practices of investment
that sustain subjects and their discourses.

This radical dimension of loss is, therefore, nothing other than **[[the
loss of the security of a metalanguage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[the
loss of a \"claim to a position of
exhaustiveness\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** which would precisely be the
claim of grammar: we are faced, once again, with **[[the inescapable
dimen-sion of rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that \"stumbling block\"
**[[which forces discourse to discover that it can only define rhetoric
rhetorically, by participat-ing in it]{.underline}]{.mark}**, i.e., by
stumbling, **[[by elaborating not a grammar of rhet-oric but a rhetoric

What, however, is a grammar (a formalized grammar) if not the epitome of
metalanguage? **[[Grammar is]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus---and Lacan
knows it---**[[one more impossible desire: the desire to establish a
norm]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a rule of correctness, to avoid precisely
the misprision inher-ent in the enterprise, to be for once a non-dupe.
But who knows better than Lacan that \"non-dupes err\"?24 Lacan\'s
writing thus articulates the very torment which inhabits logic. And the
chances taken by Lacan\'s text---what gives it a chance and what makes
its chance ours---is **[[the spark struck up in language by the inner
ten-sion of a discourse struggling with itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
struggling **[[with its]{.underline}]{.mark}** dou-ble,
**[[contradictory desire: the desire for grammar and its counter-part,

**Psychoanalysis is based specifically on the irrational actions of
leaders. Absent the alt's analysis, policymakers will always shift their
failed desire onto an external scapegoat, ensuring dangerous
interventions.**

Psychoanalysis and international relations revisited", International
Relations, SagePub)

That interest is long gone, except for a minor and embattled presence in
the sub-field of political psychology. Even there, little has changed in
three decades since a volume entitled Psychological Models in
International Politics appeared, devoid of a single reference to
psychoanalysis.2 Freud, as Paul Roazen lamented long ago, 'has remained
throughout political science something of a spook'.3 Roazen referred to
American political science. Critics of this summation combed political
science to cite at best a few marginal forays (usually British or
Commonwealth in origin) into psychoanalysis, which is of interest only
insofar as a particular analyst thereby buttresses his or her
paradigmatic preferences in constructivism or poststructural discourse
analysis.4 A major methodological objection to psychoanalysis is that an
investigative means devised for individuals is inadvisable to apply to
collective entities. States cannot possess egos, ids, or superegos --
although a case has been made by Zizek, and Erich Fromm long before him,
for the palpable influence of an 'institutional unconscious'.5 Freud was
alert to the perils of overstepping domains when he pondered whether
civilizations could be neurotic.6 Psychoanalysts, an eminent analyst
cautions, are: uniquely qualified to understand, analyze and assist the
patient on the couch, but as soon as they move away from this personal
confrontation (or the modification of a small group) to comment on
matters outside their training and experience, the value of their
comments would appear to depend on their knowledge and wisdom, not on
their qualification.7 While some scholars draw upon cognitive frameworks
to analyze otherwise overlooked political phenomena, [**psychoanalysis
remains firmly on the fringes of IR**]{.underline} where Lacanian
discourse analysts treat us to such illuminating sentences as, 'It then
endeavors, via constructing fantasies, to use transitive discourse
objects to sustain the desire for the constructed dichotomies, which
hankers for discursive closure'.8 Psychoanalysis, contrary to his
proponents, neither begins nor ends with Lacan. [**[Few scholars
deny]{.mark} that [psychological factors exert a significant effect upon
politics]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Hans Morgenthau wrote that
international politics was primarily psychological in character, and
that **[the [personal]{.mark} inclinations and oddities [of
leaders]{.mark} can at crucial times [matter a great
deal]{.mark}]{.underline}**.9 If anarchy is 'what we make of it' (and
the rise of Athenian power created anxiety in Sparta), then it pays to
ask who we are in our inner worlds as well as in our outer guises when
we make something out of whatever we behold.10 At what point in an
explanation do psychological factors -- from personal quirks to group
dynamics to mass perceptions -- become important? From the very
beginning of our lives, is the psychoanalytic answer. Indeed,
psychoanalysis aims to change where the beginning is reckoned to begin
in any explanatory probe. In the 1930s, radical analyst Wilhelm Reich
was really rather moderate when arguing that **[[psychoanalysis]{.mark}
had a role in [explain]{.mark}ing [why actors pursue]{.mark} what to the
external observer are [irrational]{.mark}, blinkered, [and
self-injurious actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.11 Reich's intent was not
only to explain 'deviations from rationality' but to inquire into the
adequacy of our notion of rationality, especially as this seductive and
problematic concept is buffeted by changing contexts and personal
interests.12 [**[Misperception is a widely accepted phenomenon in
IR]{.mark} now**,]{.underline} as is the imputed sway in decision-making
circles of analogical reasoning, **[[such as the domino
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13 But important differences exist between
Freud's depth psychology and, to use shorthand for a bundle of related
practices, 'cognitive psychology'.14 [The purpose of psychoanalysis is
to pry into our **unconscious drives**]{.underline} and defenses [to
illuminate their influence over]{.underline} the [**motives** and
**behavior**]{.underline} of the beholder as well as the beheld.15
Cognitive psychology, unlike psychoanalysis, usually exempts
practitioners from being prey to their own forms of unexamined
irrationality, which may be one reason for its relative toleration in
the field. This essay reconsiders, long after Lasswell's heyday, whether
**[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, beyond discourse analysis,
**[[can be a useful interpretive approach]{.mark} in international
politics]{.underline}**. What is the significance in human behavior of
the unconscious, that is, of motives and forces of which we are largely
unaware?16 (Extremely significant, Freud says, because unconscious
forces, if unexposed, tend to make our decisions for us.) The first
section examines Freudian analysis and its uneasy relation to political
analysis.Zizthen examine key issues raised by psychoanalysis regarding
the efficacy of IR models, the concept of selfinterest, and the waging
of war. Finally, to appraise the 'value added' of this
approach,Zizexamine psychoanalytic understandings of intervention in
Vietnam and, more briefly, the 'war on terror'. The argument is that
psychoanalytically attuned approaches yield important insights into the
wielding of power. Psychoanalytic triggers Psychoanalysts regard human
emotional life as a continuum in which we share every feeling and
impulse to some degree, and indulge or capitulate to them if the
combination of internal and external conditions is right. Violent
emotions are universal, as much so as love, though they usually are
channeled in muted ways that avert harm in everyday life. One is only
tempted to summon the psychoanalyst when excesses form a profoundly
damaging pattern. The same rule of thumb goes for bringing
psychoanalytic perspectives, or psychological predilections of leaders,
to the fore in inquiries: Do so when behavior is very much out of
keeping with observable circumstances. Freud, while shying away from
direct applications to politics, always intended that psychoanalysis
contribute to the social sciences and even to public health.17 At
minimum, such exploratory expeditions demand considerable knowledge both
of psychoanalysis and of the social scientific field into which one
introduces analytic concepts. One may well ask whether we need to know
what, for example, the youthful years of leaders have to do with their
professional lives. Their actions surely are overdetermined.18
Methodological humility, a rare enough trait anywhere, is called for. In
1965, after the long-distance 'analysis' of candidate Barry Goldwater,
the American Psychiatric Association president rebuked those who
diagnosed political personalities from afar.19 Psychological
reductionism is a tempting pitfall, though anyone trained in political
science, with its overvaluation of quantitative methods and formal
theory, is unlikely to stumble into it.20 One thereby would
underestimate familiar tangible forces that shape political decisions.
Still, [seasoned scholars cannot credibly deny that international
politics is at best only **partly** a rational enterprise]{.underline}.
If so, [**[IR is a valid]{.mark} arena for psychoanalytic
inquiry**.]{.underline} What some players within IR deem rational --
'thinking about the unthinkable', '[brinksmanship', or 'winning hearts
and minds']{.underline} [through supposedly **selective
violence**]{.underline} -- will [appear **irrational**]{.underline} [to
beholders]{.underline} who apply different standards. '[You can't be too
careful' is a bromide that counterproductively spurs **dangerous
imbroglios**]{.underline}, [such as the security dilemma.]{.underline}21
[Rationality]{.underline} often [is]{.underline} what we choose to make
of it, [under institutional pressure, disciplinary habits, and
unexamined personal traits.]{.underline} Mercer notes how [rational
choice notions, supposedly stripped of emotion, consistently lead to
distorted depictions]{.underline} [of human action,]{.underline}
although this insight harks back half a century or more in Freudian
annals.22 Consider too Mannheim's classic distinction where [what is
functionally rational is not always substantively
rationa]{.underline}l.23 Ellul captured this significant divide acutely
when he defined technology as the application of increasingly refined
means to ever more carelessly considered ends.24 Rationality is
conceived as rationalization, a defense mechanism cloaking other
motives, which may or may not be conscious. [Psychoanalysis is applied
not only to the leadership but also to relations between elites and the
citizenry.]{.underline} Rose notes that actors must be understood not
only in terms of their material interests and institutional constraints
but also in terms of their images (of reality) and identifications.25
[This venerable formulation sets up interestingly porous dichotomies
between inside and outside (private and public), and between the social
and psychic]{.underline}. A lack of personality and group psychology
studies only deprives us of useful ways to burrow into the 'agentic',
which is, after all, where the 'mutual constitution' of agency and
structure that constructivists are so concerned about occurs. As for
realists, the political murderers in a Brecht play apologize to their
victim: 'Sorry -- force of circumstance' -- a sentiment realists readily
understand. But one trouble with halting inquiry here is that Freud
demonstrated how often, to quell a conscience or to fool an outsider, we
attribute to circumstances what are our own impulsions. '[**[A
common]{.mark} psychodynamic [mechanism is to convert desire so that it
appears an external necessity']{.mark}**,]{.underline} Bakan explains,
'It is thus an open question in each instance whether what appears to be
external necessity really is that, or simply a facet concealing some
internal pressure'.26 Hence, even when interests seem to do the trick in
explaining behavior, [**[actors]{.mark} may [reso]{.mark}**[rt
to]{.mark}]{.underline} pleasing or **[[exculpating rationales to
justify callous aims]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Acknowledging this slippery
fact of political life is useful to understanding and even anticipating
what actors do. [The story that the US elites invaded Iraq because they
feared]{.underline} a weapon of mass destruction ([WMD]{.underline})
threat [does not play well anymore]{.underline} despite interesting but
tenuous defenses.27 If key actors say they were misled by faulty
intelligence, which they had a strong hand in purveying, then one is
well advised to look elsewhere for explanation. [Typically, we can come
up with]{.underline} a plausible answer based on [material interests
such as oil]{.underline} ([ridiculed in mainstream circles at the
time]{.underline}). Typically too, there are 'multiple equilibria' in
policy choice. Why did these leaders select this course of action when
force of circumstances was not determinative? Why impute credence to
what is 'in actors' heads' when imputation of material factors or
structural forces can do the job? The reason is that [although social
structural forces operate apart from individual human agency, they
remain **dependent** on the **character** of human beings to carry them
out]{.underline}. 'It is precisely at this juncture that Freudian theory
proves so suggestive', Lichtman argued, 'For the conjunction of
individual intentions and social structures is embedded dialectically in
the alienated institutions of social life and in the repressed
unconscious of specific social agents'.28 How does this apply in IR?

### Butler

**Butler's theory of performativity reproduces the subject of
philosophy**

**CAMPBELL 2001** (Kirsten, dept of sociology at Goldsmiths College,
University of London, "The Plague of the Subject: Psychoanalysis and
Judith Butler's Psychic Life of Power," International Journal of
Sexuality and Gender Studies, Vol. 6, Nos. 1/2)

Lacan (1977) argues that [[the Hegelian model]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} "being conscious of self, the [fully conscious self"
[produces a subject]{.mark} that is founded in the conscious and
[secured by consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 296). [Because this
subject takes up a defensive position against its unconscious other, [it
cannot know itself in its refusal of the
unconscious]{.mark}]{.underline}. In that position, the subject projects
consciousness and self as a unified identity. [That unity of identity
enables the subject to claim mastery and presence of self]{.underline}.
In this position, the subject is substantiated as a conscious self that
is transparent, certain, and foundational. [This is a subject in the
traditional philosophical sense]{.underline} of a conscious self. Lacan
(1991) argues that the subject founds philosophical discourse. In his
later work, L'envers de la psychanalyse, Lacan (1991) contends that
[philosophy founds its knowing upon a conscious self]{.underline}, an
"I" that believes that what it perceives of itself represents its true
self, that it can know itself and, hence, [that]{.underline} it [can
master itself]{.underline} (p. 71). Philosophical knowledge continually
reproduces this transcendental and illusory conscious self (p. 70). For
Lacan, [[philosophy is a **discourse of mastery**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In Subjects of Desire, Butler (1987) considers the implications of
Lacan's critique of Hegelian philosophy. She briefly, but suggestively,
discusses the implications of Lacan's critique of Hegel for
philosophical thinking. Butler argues that:

Inasmuch as philosophy savours the postulation of a self-adequate
subject, philosophical

discourse purports to say all that it means, and never to mean more than
it actually says.

The psychoanalytic deconstruction of philosophy would, then, consist in
listening to the lacks and gaps in philosophical discourse, and
theorising on that basis what kind of defence against desire the
philosophical project seems to be (1987, pp. 196--197). Considered in
these terms, [[Butler's theory]{.mark} of the subject]{.underline} in
The Psychic Life of Power [reproduces philosophical
discourse]{.underline}. It postulates the self-adequate subject of
philosophy, a conscious self that is transparent, certain, and
foundational. [Her theory **[continually performs this
subject]{.mark}**, reiterating this transcendental and illusory
conscious self of identity]{.underline}. If that theory is read
symptomatically[, this]{.underline} philosophical discourse of the
conscious subject repudiates the unconscious. It [repeats the
philosophical defence against its unconscious other. [Butler's missed
encounter with the]{.mark} psychoanalytic [unconscious traps her
theory]{.mark} of the subject [within the philosophical discourse of the
conscious self]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fundamental psychoanalytic
distinction between the conscious and the unconscious reveals "reason's
inability to come outside of itself, to enclose and know itself from the
outside: the inadequation of the subject and its other" (Grosz, 1993, p.
189). [Psychic Life continually repeats, and is haunted by, the
impossible task of understanding the]{.underline} "being conscious of
self, the [fully conscious self." [The aporia]{.mark} [of the
unconscious]{.mark} in Butler's theory of the subject [prevents her from
theorising the psychic life of power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Psychic Life articulates an extremely important political and
theoretical problematic for contemporary theory. Politically, it
provides a critical account of the formation of identity in power.
Theoretically, it deploys both Foucault and Freud to produce this
critical account, opening the possibility of a powerful intersection of
Foucauldian and psychoanalytic theory. Butler's repetition of
philosophical discourse, and [[her failure to undertake a psychoanalytic
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[prevents her from developing
this]{.underline}]{.mark} important [[theoretical and political
project]{.mark}. Instead, like the return of the repressed, [that
project continually suffers the **plague of the (repressed)
unconscious**. In order to understand the psychic life of power, it is
necessary to reconsider the]{.mark}]{.underline} problematic
relationship between the political subject of Foucault and the
[[unconscious]{.underline}]{.mark} subject of Freud.

### Nuclear war

#### Nuclear War rhetoric leads to psychic numbing. 

(There is a better tag for this)

**Chernus 91** Ira, "Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology of the
Nuclear Age",
https://books.google.com/books?id=P5ZadFGmKq0C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Nuclear+Madness:+Religion+and+the+Psychology+of+the+Nuclear+Age&source=bl&ots=w4uQtfU365&sig=ACfU3U0P3sG4sqvLdHui2uA5PQI9WAUzLQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwimxNup8aDjAhUGTN8KHVQEANAQ6AEwBnoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false

[[The dilemma can no longer be attributed to a paucity of public
knowledge and debate.]{.underline}]{.mark}Nor can it simply be charged
to widespread immorality. Most Americans proclaim their love for their
land, their children, and themselves unashamedly. [[For some this love
leads to antinuclear sentiments, for others it leads to a pronuclear
stance.]{.underline}]{.mark} But there is little reason to doubt that
love is just as genuine in either case. [Perhaps that is why moral
appeals are no more successful than intellectual appeals in removing the
nuclear threat. It is hard for us to see what other approach might be
available, though, because the two tracks of antinuclear activism are
the two tracks laid down for all moral problem solving in the
foundations of Western culture.]{.underline} The first rests on the
premise of classical Greek thought (and its Enlightenment revival) that
evil stems from ignorance, that those who know the right will inevitably
do the right. The second rests on the biblical premise that evil stems
from a misguided or perverted will. In the present case, however, it
seems that those who are committed to nuclear abolition do need a new
diagnosis of the problem. [[Some disarmament advocates already entertain
a third approach. They focus not on problems of thinking or willing but
of feeling, or in more general terms on psychological
problems.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Probably the best known psychological
diagnosis is]{.underline}]{.mark} summed up in Robert Jay Lifton's term
[[psychic numbing.]{.underline}]{.mark} According to this view [[**the
essential problem lies not in the way we think or choose but in our
failure to think and choose at all, and this is essentially a failure of
imagination -- a lack of images of the threat**. Psychic numbing is a
very real phenomenon, and a psychological perspective offers fruitful
new approaches to the nuclear dilemma.]{.underline}]{.mark} But it seems
to me that [[the crucial problem is not an absence of images but rather
the kind of images we use to think about the nuclear
issue.]{.underline}]{.mark} Somehow these images must promote psychic
numbing. [[If so, then it matters little whether we think about the Bomb
or not. In either case, we will remain numb and unable to make
meaningful changes in the status quo.]{.mark}]{.underline} This book
therefore takes Lifton's theoretical model as its starting point and
builds upon it, developing a broader model as its starting point and
builds upon it, developing a broader model that can account for both the
proliferation of nuclear imagery and the persistence of psychic numbing.
[Lifton suggests that psychic numbing must be understood as in some
sense a religious problem. My own previous research suggests that most
of our nuclear images have striking analogues in traditional religious
images.]{.underline} So it seems especially fruitful to probe the
problem from the perspective of the psychology of religion. My approach
to the problem begins with two theorists of psychology and religion who
have influence Lifton's own though -- R.D. Laing and Paul Tillich. The
first three chapters apply their thought to the psychodynamics of the
Cold War and the superpowers' arms race. Since the Cold War remains with
discourse, and as an ever-present possibility for the future, I speak of
it in the present tense.

#### Nuclear Rhetoric prevents meaningful scenario planning - The discussion itself is the nuclear annihilation. Psychic numbing leads to the false sense of securitization 

**Chernus 91** Ira, "Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology of the
Nuclear Age",
https://books.google.com/books?id=P5ZadFGmKq0C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Nuclear+Madness:+Religion+and+the+Psychology+of+the+Nuclear+Age&source=bl&ots=w4uQtfU365&sig=ACfU3U0P3sG4sqvLdHui2uA5PQI9WAUzLQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwimxNup8aDjAhUGTN8KHVQEANAQ6AEwBnoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false

[[The prerequisite for relative balance is what Lifton calls
"grounding]{.mark}".]{.underline} The self must be grounded in a sense
of itself as a biological and historical unity, an ongoing integrated
vital organism. [[This grounding depends, in turn, on a basic trust in
life itself as a dependable balance of structure and change in which the
self is permanently embedded, and which will continue beyond every
individual's death.]{.mark} The prerequisite for basic trust is an
image-constellation or form that can symbolize both the death of the
individual and the survival of the individual's meaning through
biological, spiritual, cultural, or natural continuity. [This is what
Lifton calls "symbolic immortality." When there is no adequate form of
symbolic immortality, the result is psychic numbing.]{.mark} Through
Lifton's many discussions of psychic numbing]{.underline} view it from
varying perspectives, they all point toward a basic (though often
implicit) theory of the phenomenon rooted in his larger paradigm.
[According to this theory, a massive death encounter calls into question
every form of symbolic immortality; it raises the possibility that the
stream of life as a whole may come to an end.]{.underline} Therefor it
undercuts the grounding of the self. **[[For the ungrounded self, every
experience of psychological change evokes the threat of death for two
reasons. Without assurance of life continuity, the self fears that the
decentering caused by changing forms and images may be permanent. Since
the decentered self has no stable patterns for filtering stimuli,
permanent decentering means a threat of being annihilated by
overwhelming stimuli. At the same time the decentered self also fears
that it may search for new imagery corresponding to the new stimuli but
fail to find any, leaving it bereft of all stimuli and all interactions
with the world.]{.underline}]{.mark}** When symbolic immortality is
undermined, therefore, [[the self feels the threat of annihilation from
every new stimulus that calls for new inner imagery. This fear of
annihilation, both from too few and too many stimuli, can lead the self
to refuse to seek new images at all. When the formative process thus
shuts itself down, the result is psychic numbing or death in
life.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is what has happened to all of us,
Lifton contends, under the threat of nuclear annihilation. [[We are
simply too petrified to accept, or even seek, adequate images of the
Bomb and its effects.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Security

#### Psychoanalysis is ontologically tied to the ongoing quest for security -- The self will always attempt to tie itself towards its false sense of protection

Tillich, Laing, and Hillman [in a comprehensive theoretical model for
interpreting the nuclear age]{.underline}. Laing and Tillich agree that
[[the ultimate concern of every human life is the quest for ontological
security. So a psychology that enters the domain of ultimate concern
must become an ontological psychology. In ontological terms the self's
quest for vitality is its quest for ontological security; to feel really
alive is to feel genuinely real.]{.underline}]{.mark} Since each of the
psyche's two impulses has a limited reality and each is in conflict with
the other, the self must feel less than fully real. But [[the self can
feel secure in its reality as long as it feels that the formative
process is free to follow its innate path toward religious imagery.
Ontological security thus depends on experiencing the endless freedom of
the image-making process]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is our won most
genuine reality, or what Laing calls the true self: ["our personal idiom
of experiencing... imagination, dreams, fantasy, and beyond that to ever
further reaches of experience." So security requires that imagination be
grounded in religious image, which can give form to the possibility of
pure formlessness.]{.underline} The self must be able to look into pure
possibility, which portends the abyss of unreality, within an immutably
real structure and see pure possibility as the promise of perfect
reality (even if that promise reamains an unrealized ideal). When there
is no grounding in a religious image, the formative process seems unable
to continue its innate path toward religious imagery[. [The psyche feels
trapped in its limited reality. Yet, since it has no form for the
prospect of formlessness, the pure possibility of that prospect can be
experienced only as the threat of imminent unreality. This is the
state]{.mark}]{.underline} that Laing calls **[[ontological insecurity.
Psychic numbing must be understood in ontological terms as a response to
this crisis.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Psychic numbing displays the same
psychodynamics described by Laing as the 'schizoid strategy' and by
Tillich as 'neurosis.' In fact the schizoid strategy can best be
understood as a particular manifestation (or perhaps a more precise
description) of what Tillich calls neurosis. The schizoid fantasies that
Laing discovered parallel the neurotic's nightmare images described by
Tillich.

### Cap

#### Getting swept off our feet by our fantasies ends with a harsh encounter that politics cannot be controlled by us 

**Stavrakakis 99** (Yannis Stavrakakis has PhD degrees from the
'Ideology and Discourse Analysis' programme at the University of Essex,
"Lacan and the Political", p.64, 10/3/99)

The field of social construction and political reality is the field in
which the symbolisation of this real is attempted. Chaitin is correct
when asserting that [symbolisation has the creative power to produce
cultural identities, but at]{.underline} a price, [the cost of covering
over the fundamental nothingness that forms its foundation it is
culture, not nature, that abhors a vacuum, above all that of its own
contingency]{.underline} (Chaitin, 1996:4- 5), [of its ultimate
inability to master and symbolise the impossible real: there is a
structural lack in the symbolic, which means that certain points of the
real canít be symbolised in a definite manner]{.underline}. **[The
unmitigated real provokes anxiety, and this in turn gives rise to
never-ending, defensive, imaginary constructs]{.underline}** (Verhaeghe,
1994:60). Following from this, [all human productions \[Society itself,
culture, religion, science can be understood in the light of that
structural failure of the symbolic in relationship to the
real]{.underline} (ibid.: 61). [It is the moment of this failure, the
moment of our encounter with the real, that is revealed as the moment of
the political par excellence]{.underline} in our reading of Lacan. [It
is the constitutivity of this moment in Lacanian psychoanalysis that
proves our fantasmatic conception of the socio-political institution of
society as a harmonious totality to be no more than a mirage. It is this
traumatic moment of the political qua encounter with the real that
initiates again and again a process of symbolisation, and initiates the
ever-present hegemonic play between different symbolisations of this
real. This play leads to the emergence of politics, to the political
institution of a new social fantasy (or of many antagonistic fantasies
engaged in a struggle for hegemony) in the place of the dislocated
one,]{.underline} and so on and so forth. In this light, Lacan's
insistence on the centrality of the real, especially in the latter part
of his teaching, acquires major political importance. Lacan himself, in
his seminar on The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis uses
noise and accident as metaphors or examples of our encounter with the
real. It might be possible to add the political to this chain of
equivalences. Lacan's schema of socio-political life is that of a play,
an unending circular play between possibility and impossibility, between
construction and destruction, representation and failure, articulation
and dislocation, reality and the real, politics and the political.

#### Capitalism functions on empty promises of new commodities that will bring satisfaction to the people---the AFF only plays into this illusion and ultimately fails.

[Capitalist ideology aims at producing subjects who experience their
existence as dissatisfied and simultaneously invest themselves
completely in the ideal of happiness or complete
satisfaction]{.underline}.15 [Th is idea manifests itself]{.underline}
not just [in the everyday workings of capitalism]{.underline} but in its
most serious theorists --- from Adam Smith and David Ricardo to
Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. According to Adam Smith, society
can attain the satisfaction of true prosperity as long as it unleashes
humanity's natural propensity for accumulation. He writes: "Th e natural
eff ort of every individual to bett er his own condition, when suff ered
to exert itself with freedom and security, is so powerful a principle,
that it is alone, and without any assistance, not only capable of
carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a
hundred impertinent obstructions."16 [Th e desire to accumulate enables
capitalist subjects to overcome barriers and obtain
happiness.]{.underline} For Smith and others, there is no question of an
insurmountable barrier and no possibility of enjoying the barrier
itself. [Capitalism survives on]{.underline} the [basis of]{.underline}
the same [misrecognition]{.underline} that plagues Freud's neurotic:
[the mistaking of desire for drive]{.underline}, [the inability to see
satisfaction in the act of not getting the object]{.underline}. Without
engendering this collective misrecognition, capitalism could not sustain
itself as capitalism. [Capitalist subjects structurally fail to see
their own inherent self-satisfaction, and it is this failure that keeps
them going as capitalist subjects.]{.underline} Freud's thought reveals
this, and it reveals that there is a beyond of the capitalist subject
--- a beyond that is the death drive. **[Th e emancipatory politics of
psychoanalysis is thus inherently anticapitalist insofar as the
functioning of capitalism depends on the idea of obtaining the
object]{.underline}**. [Capitalism feeds off of desire's perpetual
dissatisfaction. Th is dissatisfaction leads to eff orts to accumulate
more capital, att empts to increase productivity]{.underline}, [and the
introduction of new commodities into the market]{.underline} --- in
short, every aspect of capitalist economics. [Marketers in capitalist
society are bent upon producing desire in subjects and blinding them to
the drive]{.underline}. In the Grundrisse Marx describes the way
[capitalism perpetuates desire through the production of
needs]{.underline}: "[Production not only supplies a material for the
need, but it also supplies a need for the material. . . . The need which
consumption feels for the object is created by the perception of
it]{.underline}. Th e object of art --- like every other product ---
creates a public which is sensitive to art and enjoys beauty. Production
thus not only creates an object for the subject, but also a subject for
the object."17 Capitalism functions by sustaining --- and even
increasing --- a sense of dissatisfaction commensurate with desire. Th
is explains capitalism's infatuation with the new. [Capitalism
constantly seeks out and embraces what is new, because the new keeps
desire going by helping to create a sense of lack]{.underline}. [Th e
new holds the promise of a future enjoyment that will surpass whatever
the subject has experienced before]{.underline}. Th is promise is the
engine behind capitalism's creation of ever more needs. Th e more
represents a constant lure, the next more --- at least from afar ---
always seems to be it, the object that would provide the elusive
enjoyment. A portrayal of the inherent dissatisfaction that capitalism
requires even among the wealthy occurs near the end of Roman Polanski's
Chinatown (1974). In the fi lm's penultimate scene, Jake Gitt es ( Jack
Nicholson) reproaches Noah Cross ( John Huston) for continuing a pattern
of ruthless accumulation despite having already obtained a vast fortune.
Th eir conversation makes clear the insatiable nature of the imperative
to accumulate. Jake asks, "How much are you worth?" Cross, sensing the
possibility of buying Jake off , says, "I have no idea. How much do you
want?" But Jake doesn't want money; he wants to know what keeps Cross
going. Jake continues, "No, I just want to know what you're worth. Over
ten million?" Cross responds, "Oh my, yes." Th en Jake asks, "Why are
you doing it? How much bett er can you eat? What can you buy that you
can't already aff ord?" Cross gives an answer emblematic of the
capitalist subject: "Th e future, Mr. Getz \[sic\], the future." Cross's
appeal to the "future" indicates that he believes in [the promise of
capitalism]{.underline} [--- that the future holds the lost enjoyment
that always eludes us today]{.underline}. Despite his millions, his
emphasis on the future demonstrates that Cross cannot recognize his own
inherent satisfaction.18 [Capitalism leaves individual subjects with a
constant sense of their own dissatisfaction,]{.underline} [but it also
holds out the lure of future enjoyment, which prompts both the
capitalist to create a new commodity and the consumer to buy
it]{.underline}. Just as the capitalist hopes that every newly created
commodity will be it, so does the consumer. However, **[no new commodity
can ever provide the lost enjoyment for either the capitalist or the
consumer, no matt er how successful the commodity is, because the
enjoyment has only an imaginary status]{.underline}**. [Once the
commodity is realized for each]{.underline} (put on the market, in the
case of the capitalist, or purchased, in the case of the consumer), [it
necessarily loses its enjoyment value]{.underline}. In this sense,
capitalism depends upon the dynamic of the child at Christmas time. On
Christmas Eve all the presents under the tree off er the promise of a
future enjoyment, but by aft ernoon on Christmas Day the child ends up
bored and desiring once again, not having found the elusive enjoyment in
any of the opened packages. Th is boredom isn't just the sign of the
child's narcissism or that it has been spoiled by overindulgent parents;
it is, rather, a structural necessity within the desiring world of
capitalism. [Th e cycle of the promise of future enjoyment and then the
inevitable dissatisfaction that follows can only perpetuate itself as
long as capitalist subjects continue to hope, that is, to believe in the
promise that the new commodity holds out]{.underline}. More than
anything else, [hope keeps capitalism going]{.underline}. [Giving up
hope]{.underline} --- and yet continuing on, enjoying continuing on ---
[moves us from desire to the drive.]{.underline} Th is type of
transformation also entails the end of the capitalist subject:
**[capitalist subjects without hope are no longer capitalist
subjects]{.underline}**.

#### Capitalist subject endlessly accumulate in order to try to fill the lack created by the formation subjectivity---nothing will ever fill that lack.

[What holds us back from this possibility is our inability to discover a
way of fi nding satisfaction satisfying]{.underline}. Th is failure,
perhaps even more than its human costs, is what most disturbs Marx about
capitalism. Th e points in Th e Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts at
which Marx seems to slip into humanism as he recounts the eff ects of
capitalism are the points at which he tries to articulate, though he
wouldn't put it this way, the capitalist system's resistance to the
death drive: [capitalism doesn't allow us to find satisfaction in our
satisfaction]{.underline}. Its logic is one that Marx calls
"self-renunciation." As he puts it in perhaps the most famous passage
from the Manuscripts, "The less you eat, drink and buy books; the less
you go to the theater, the dance hall, the public house; the less you
think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save ---
the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will
devour --- your capital. Th e less you are, the less you express your
own life, the greater is your alienated life, the more you have, the
greater is the store of your estranged being."19 What Marx describes
here as "alienated life" is not a life made unnatural by capitalism but
a life where satisfaction is not satisfying, a life stuck within the
capitalist logic of desire. [The alternative is]{.underline} not, as
Marx seems to imply, an immediate satisfaction involved with eating,
drinking, and buying books; rather, it is [the ability to achieve a
mediated satisfaction]{.underline}, [becoming satisfi ed with the
satisfaction that is already ours.]{.underline} The key, in other words,
is not what we do so much as how we do it. It is on the level of this
"how," rather than a "what," that capitalism alienates its subjects from
their satisfaction. It [fosters]{.underline} this type of [alienation
through its unrelenting demand for accumulation]{.underline}.
Accumulation is the superegoic imperative apropos of capitalism. Th at
is, within capitalism, [accumulation has the status of a moral
obligation, and the capitalist subject inevitably hears an internal
voice urging her or him on for "more."]{.underline} In the fi rst volume
of Capital, Marx captures perfectly the superegoic dimension of
capitalism's command for accumulation. Th e voice proclaims,
"Accumulate, accumulate! Th at is Moses and the prophets!"20 Here, Marx
reveals the way in which the call for accumulation functions as law and
formally as a command. Despite whatever eff orts we might make at
obedience, we can never quiet this voice or sate the superego's
appetite: [no amount of accumulation is ever enough, either for the
individual capitalist subject or for the capitalist society on the
whole]{.underline}. Th e debt to the superego, in other words, is infi
nite. Th e more we accumulate, the more we see there is for us to
accumulate.21 Once we surrender to the demand for accumulation, we only
get sucked further and further in by it. Th e fundamental project of
capitalist ideology involves identifying accumulation with enjoyment. Th
is is why the capitalist subject can understand, if not identify with,
the actions of the character Trina in Frank Norris's naturalist novel
McTeague. In the most memorable scene of the novel, Trina goes to bed
with the gold she has hoarded and derives an intensely sexual pleasure
from this experience. Norris writes: "One evening she had even spread
all the gold pieces between the sheets, and had then gone to bed,
stripping herself, and had slept all night upon the money, taking a
strange and ecstatic pleasure in the touch of the smooth fl at pieces
the length of her entire body."22 Th ough Norris presents this sexual
encounter between Trina and her gold as a perversion, it nonetheless
resonates strongly and seems true to most readers because of the
seemingly natural link between accumulation and enjoyment. Th e sexual
nature of the gold in this scene stems from its ability to package and
contain an enjoyment that would otherwise remain ungraspable. Most of us
do not have sex with gold or other monetary forms. But we do accept the
link between accumulation and enjoyment that leads to the actions of a
character like Trina. Most oft en, the [apotheosis of accumulation
manifests itself in purchasing commodities that seem to embody future
enjoyment.]{.underline} One buys the newest clothes, the trendiest
music, or the latest technological gadget in order to access the
enjoyment that these commodities promise. But under the sway of
capitalist ideology this att itude extends even to relationships: one
chooses friends, albeit unconsciously, who will advance one's own social
status, and one hopes to fi nd a romantic partner who will do the same.
Th e most private forms of enjoyment in capitalist society have their
basis in the idea of accumulation and are unthinkable outside of it. It
follows from this that the primary line of social critique launched
against capitalist society would focus on society's failure to live up
to its ideology. It is a truism of Marxist analysis --- especially aft
er the Frankfurt School --- to suggest that [capitalist ideology uses
the image of successful accumulation in order to hide the lack of
accumulation that most subjects endure and thereby produce
docility]{.underline}. According to this position, images of enjoyment,
such as Hollywood fi lms, create a false or illusory pleasure that helps
to satisfy otherwise dissatisfi ed subjects. While entranced by the
romantic bond between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman or between
Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman, capitalist subjects do not think
about their position within the capitalist order of things. [Th ese
subjects invest themselves in the image of enjoyment rather than in the
real thing.]{.underline} Th is is why Th eodor Adorno claims that "all
mass culture is fundamentally adaptation."23 Th e promulgation of the
image of enjoyment, for Adorno and the Frankfurt School, becomes
capitalist ideology's way of creating subjects who believe that they are
enjoying themselves while existing within the intractable
dissatisfaction of capitalism. In the face of capitalist ideology's
proliferation of such images, the task for the critical thinker becomes
one of tearing them apart, exposing the lack of enjoyment at the heart
of them and showing how, as Adorno and Max Horkheimer make clear in
their Dialectic of Enlightenment, capitalism and its ideological
handmaiden, the culture industry, never really deliver.24 According to
this view, [capitalist subjects aren't really enjoying themselves
despite feeling that they are. Such subjects actually exist in a state
of perpetual dissatisfaction]{.underline}, and Adorno and Horkheimer
hope to expose this dissatisfaction for what it is in order to create a
revolutionary consciousness akin to their own. For Marxist thinkers like
those of the Frankfurt School, [the chief problem with capitalism is
that it promises an enjoyment without ever delivering on that
promise]{.underline} (even to those who seem taken care of by the
capitalist system).

#### A psychoanalytic interrogation of capitalism is the only way to challenge the never ending drive of accumulation

**McGowan 2013**  \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television

Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013\] // afre

At times, Marx indicates how the capitalist mode of production
transforms the driving force of human activity, and he implicitly
envisions Communism as a corrective to this transformation. [The drive
to accumulate]{.underline}, in this view, [ceases to be a drive inherent
in human subjectivity itself, and an alternative becomes
visible]{.underline}. In the second volume of Capital, Marx almost
articulates the position of psychoanalytic emancipatory politics
directly when he says, "For [capitalism is already essentially abolished
once we assume that it is enjoyment that is the driving motive and not
enrichment itself]{.underline}." Here, the distinction between enjoyment
and enrichment as motives for action divides capitalism from other
unmentioned economic systems. [The alternative to accumulation
is]{.underline} satisfaction --- or, more specifically, [the recognition
of our satisfaction]{.underline}. [The fundamental problem with
capitalism is this: it doesn't allow us to recognize our enjoyment or
even to grasp enjoyment as what drives us]{.underline}. It's not that
capitalism deprives us of the satisfaction involved with thinking,
loving, theorizing, singing, painting, and fencing (to use Marx's
examples cited above) but that it doesn't allow us to view satisfaction
as a possible motive for our acts. We can think of the drive for
enjoyment or a drive centered around enjoyment as a possibility existing
outside of the capitalist system. This drive --- [the death drive ---
would have no purpose other than enjoyment, which is to say that it
would operate in contrast to the accumulative logic of the capitalist
drive]{.underline}. The capitalist drive to accumulate represents a
distortion of the death drive, a rewriting of it that changes its
structure. But the capitalist drive to accumulate does not simply do
away with enjoyment. As a rewriting of the death drive, it continues to
provide the enjoyment that this drive does, though this drive to
accumulate makes it more difficult for subjects to identify the site
where they enjoy. Our investment in capitalism doesn't occur through a
complete neglect of our enjoyment but depends in a fundamental way on
its ability to deliver enjoyment. If capitalist subjects weren't
actually enjoying themselves at all, they would not continue to be
capitalist subjects. We really do enjoy ourselves within the capitalist
universe --- the death drive continues to function --- but [we don't
enjoy in the way that capitalist ideology tries to convince us that we
do]{.underline}. [Political struggle is]{.underline} not simply a
struggle over the right to enjoy certain goods and the distribution of
this right. It is also --- even predominantly --- [a struggle over how
we identify and locate our enjoyment]{.underline}. [Capitalist ideology
is triumphant today because it has won this struggle]{.underline}. As
capitalist subjects, we must define enjoyment in terms of accumulation:
one enjoys insofar as one accumulates objects of desire. This definition
has become ubiquitous: according to the prevailing logic today, even the
enjoyment that derives from romance comes from acquiring one's object of
desire. But this is not the only way of figuring enjoyment. **[One of
the most important political tasks for emancipatory politics today
consists in transforming our way of thinking about enjoyment ---
breaking the link that capitalist ideology has forged between
accumulation and enjoyment.]{.underline}**

#### The alt is breaking away from the fantastical promises capitalism makes.

[When it comes to fantasy's role in the subject's experience, Western
philosophy seems to have a clear political content]{.underline} --- and
even a political program. This program involves [stripping away the
seductive lure of fantasy]{.underline} in order to acquaint subjects not
with b are reality but with the way that reality is produced. This
emphasis on critiquing fantasy in the name of production provides a
clear link to Marx and Marxism, despite Marx's hostility to philosophy.
As is well known, Marx attacks philosophy for its failure to become
politically efficacious. His diatribe against philosophy finds its most
straightforward expression in the eleventh of his "Theses on Feuerbach."
Here Marx claims: "The philosophers have only *interpreted* the world,
in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."17 According to
Marx, philosophers have failed in the central duty of thought: having a
practical effect on the world rather than just arriving at a theoretical
understanding of it. Marx sees philosophy itself as the problem, and
hence he sees the need to break from philosophy altogether if thought is
to become politicized. In *The Philosophy of Marx* Étienne Balibar
claims: "The *Theses on Feuerbach* . . . demand a definitive exit
(*Ausgang*) from philosophy, as the only means of realizing what has
always been its loftiest ambition: emancipation, liberation."18 But
Marx's call for a "definitive exit" from philosophy comes to seem
paradoxical when we consider the politics of philosophy in juxtaposition
with the tenets of Marxist politics. Despite his attack on philosophy's
failure to politicize itself, Marx himself actually adopts a version of
philosophy's conception of politics. [Marx's political critique of
capitalist relations of production is at almost every instance a
critique of the tendency of these relations to produce subjects
entranced by fantasy and thus unable to see how the economic structure
of capitalism actually functions. The fundamental fantasy of the
capitalist subject is that of an individual existence that owes nothing
to the larger social structure in which it resides. Throughout his
career]{.underline} as an analyst and critic of capitalism, [Marx
combated this fantasy,]{.underline} but nowhere more directly than in
the *Grundrisse*. From the beginning of the first notebook in this work,
[Marx works to show that the individual is never an isolated monad but
part of a larger social order that makes individual existence
possible]{.underline}. The act of historicizing allows us, he claims, to
give the lie to individual independence. As he puts it, "The more deeply
we go back into history, the more deeply does the individual, and hence
also the producing individual, appear as dependent, as belonging to a
greater whole."19 Historicizing renders visible the array of social
forces that have enabled the individual to act in an apparently
independent manner. Like the prisoners in Plato's cave, [capitalist
subjects believe in their own unfettered agency because they cannot turn
their heads to ~~see~~ \[realize\] the forces holding them in place and
controlling]{.underline} what they see. The [ahistorical
thinking]{.underline} that predominates under capitalism blinds
individuals to their social dependence, and this blindness [acts as an
insurmountable barrier to proletarian class consciousness and the
overthrow of capitalism. The individualist fantasy that capitalism
promulgates fails to think through its own implications, and Marx
attacks the fantasy on this front as well.]{.underline} Just as fantasy
as such owes its cogency to its lack of coherence, to its ability to
exist in contradiction with itself, the individualist fantasy depends on
restricting it to a few isolated individuals. Though the individualist
believes that everyone is an individual and is capable of acting as a
free agent, this status is implicitly denied to the majority. [The
fantasy envisions workers saving money and raising themselves up in this
manner to the status of capitalists.]{.underline} In this (almost
universally accepted) account of things, capitalism is a meritocracy
that rewards the industrious and penalizes the lazy. But as Marx points
out[, the fantasy unravels as soon as we imagine it being universally
taken up.]{.underline} He says: Only as an exception does the worker
succeed through will power, physical strength and endurance, greed etc.,
in transforming his coin into money, as an exception from his class and
from the general conditions of his existence. If all or the majority are
too industrious (to the degree that industriousness in modern industry
is in fact left to their own personal choice, which is not the case in
the most important and most developed branches of production), then they
increase not the value of their commodity, but only its quantity; that
is, the demands which would be placed on it as use value. . . . An
individual worker can be *industrious* above the average, more than he
has to be in order to live as a worker, only because another lies below
the average, is lazier; he can save only because and if another wastes.
[By thinking through the individualist fantasy]{.underline} to its
endpoint and imagining what would happen if everyone adopted the policy
of industriousness, [Marx reveals the contradiction that proponents of
the fantasy must simply ignore. All fantasizing obscures such
contradictions, and this is the key to fantasy's power.]{.underline}

### Anti-Blackness

#### Here's our thesis: the aff is coercive mimeticism that locks fantasies of racial wholeness in place, this forces children to internalize the truth of identity categories which causes endless psychic suffering which should frame your decision calculus

**Viego 07** \[Antonio Viego, Professor of Ethnic Studies @ Duke, *Dead
Subjects: Toward a Politics of Loss in Latino Studies*, 2014, //Stefan\]

An essay in the collection authored by David O. Sears and Sheri Levy,
''Childhood and Adult Political Development,'' illustrates how Chow's
notion of ''[coercive mimeticism'' might be seen to function in young
ethnic-racialized children]{.underline}. However, Sears and Levy do not
address the power-knowledge relation that compels this mimicry internal
to biopower. The authors' work is interesting in the context of this
discussion because of how they link the acquisition of ethnic-racialized
identity to ''political development.'' [Political development on these
grounds, although perhaps necessary at a particular stage in the
development of a young ethnic-racialized subject's politicization, must
ultimately, given the contemporary politics of multiculturalism in U.S.
universities today, be subjected to serious criticism.]{.underline} [The
notion of politicization around ethnic-racialized identity that is being
compelled in young people is a form of coercion, taking the shape of a
compelled unpaid labor of ethnicracialized resemblance and
representation on college and university campuses]{.underline} in the
service of following through on the post-Bakke 1978 decision's
''diversity rationale.''∑∑ Richard T. Ford explains, ''The diversity
rationale is benign when understood as one of many possible reasons a
university might care about the racial demographics of its student body.
But it is dangerous when codiﬁed as the only reason race is signiﬁcant.
. . . A more subtle and much more pernicious implication hovered over
post-Bakke university life: only by highlighting their own
distinctiveness could minority students justify their presence in the
universities that admitted them.''∑∏ In attempting to understand
children's ethnic identity development, Sears and Levy turn to Jean S.
Phinney's and William E. Cross's three-stage model of ethnic identity.
In the ﬁrst stage, ''unexamined ethnic identity'' (Phinney) or
''preencounter'' (Cross), [children have not explored their ethnic
identity]{.underline}. . . . Children who have not examined their ethnic
identity might have negative feelings toward their own group (Cross
1978, see Phinney 1989). In the second stage, ''ethnic identity search''
or ''encounter and immersion,'' [young persons seek out information
about their group]{.underline} (e.g., reading books on ethnicity,
visiting ethnic museums). [This stage is considered a turning point akin
to an identity crisis]{.underline} (Erikson 1968). [Active identity
exploration often begins in high school or college but may begin in
middle school or even younger as children express identity through
joining ethnicity-based peer groups]{.underline} (Rotheram-Borus
1993).∑π Regarding the negative feelings arising in the children
discussed in the italicized sentence, [perhaps it has less to do with
the children having not examined their ethnic-racialized identity and
more to do with their having come to understand in some way that their
identity---insofar as they will be seen to actually possess one by
others---will be predicated on the labors of ethnic-racialized
resemblance.]{.underline} At the very least, we need to entertain this
possibility. [In a culture like that of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [where virtually all aspects of daily life are
profoundly suffused with racialized meanings, to deny that children's
negativity regarding their respective cultural groups might not also be
a protesting response to the imperative that they accept being marked
out as culturally different material to begin with is to deny the
complicated cognitive and intellectual work carried out by
children.]{.underline} The authors continue, ''In stage 3, '[achieved
ethnic identity' or 'internalization]{.underline},' adolescents have
developed positive self-concepts as members of their group.''∑∫ This
three-step process describes how children learn to assume an identity as
ethnic-racialized in U.S. culture. [They internalize the various
disciplinary codes and rules of proper ethnic-racialized comportment in
order to be able to resemble the acceptable American ethnic-racialized
subject. The process also describes how this internalization works to
preempt the interpretative labor]{.underline}---to engage, we might say,
in Spillers's practice of interior intersubjectivity---[that might allow
the children to ask why these extra categories attach to them and not
others and why fully assuming these ethnic-racialized identity
categories provides the primary means upon which they will be thought to
have reached the status of intelligible human subject. Children are in
fact manifesting these questions. We are not listening closely enough to
this embattled speech, because we are not sufﬁciently
imbued,]{.underline} like the lame psychoanalyst who can't intervene at
the Symbolic because she prefers to play cat and mouse in the Imaginary,
[with the new terms and conditions lending social and cultural
intelligibility to ethnic-racialized subjects on the basis of
self-mimicry.]{.underline} In the passage that ends chapter 3, Ford
writes, ''It may be that the price of providing our descendants with a
world free of social stigma and oppression of identities such as race, a
world we could be proud to call more just, is that they would not share
our identities, that they would be our heirs but not our
descendants.''∑Ω [Our deafness to this embattled, learned speech among
young ethnic-racialized subjects, who are choking on these coercive
edicts, amounts to our irresponsible and shameful refusal to not allow
them to choose not to be our descendants, to not be plagued by our
symptoms.]{.underline} We need to take seriously that these young people
may draw their inspiration from the difﬁcult and, for some, impossible
declaration that Fanon startles his readers with in the concluding pages
to Black Skin, White Masks: ''In no way should I derive my basic purpose
from the past of the peoples of color. . . . I will not make myself the
man of any past. I do not want to exalt the past at the expense of my
present and my future.''∏≠ Why should these children have to suffer the
persistent ghosts and symptoms of their ancestors? The three steps
outlined in the experiment above describe [the implantation of ethnicity
and race]{.underline} as, to use Spillers's language, ''[a poisonous
idea . . . insinuates itself not only across and between ethnicities but
within]{.underline}.''∏∞ [The researchers never ask: Why do the children
do this? Why do they think they have to do this? What compels an
understanding of identity, ethnic-racialized or otherwise, in this
way?]{.underline} Again, the question arises: ''Who, for example,
decides what constitutes a problem for the patient? And by what
criteria?''∏≤ One of the researchers they rely on, Cross, understands a
''strong ethnic identity as serving the protective function of ﬁltering
one's social worldview so as to . . . make it less dehumanizing.''∏≥ A
[strong ethnic-racialized identity,]{.underline} as I have been arguing,
[is predicated on a strengthened ego. This is held out to some as the
instantiating condition deﬁning their humanness and, from a Lacanian
position, could result only in a more thorough alienation of the human
subject. What if the very idea of a ''strong ethnic-racialized
identity'' is what in fact dramatizes a racialization practice
that]{.underline}, to return to Cross's words, [reveals to the child the
''social worldview'' as more ''dehumanizing''?]{.underline} What would
constitute a weak ethnic-racialized identity? More important, what is
the purported effect of a weak ethnic-racialized identity on a child?
Sears and Levy claim, ''The protection comes from accepting that racism
exists and affects all blacks, that negative outcomes are because of a
racist system and not the self, and that one can use various strategies
to deal with racism (withdrawal, assertion, avoidance, passivity). Other
functions that a strong identity may serve include providing purpose,
meaning, and afﬁliation, often expressed in celebration of
accomplishments of the black community.''∏∂ The commonsense nature of
this claim is very seductive, and I certainly don't want to be construed
as suggesting that celebrating the cultural productions, histories, or
traditions of a group to which you understand your self linked to or
belonging to is bad. I am saying that [this characterization of the best
defense against racism is hardly that. It works as an Imaginary
explanation, however, as long as one remains intoxicated by the idea of
a strong ethnic racialized ego. These approaches seem to accept that
race won't budge, as we argued earlier, without understanding the need
for an interpretative practice like Spillers's interior
intersubjectivity that tries to explain to oneself and to others why
race won't budge]{.underline}, why, as Seshadri-Crooks writes, ''it
shows no evidence of disappearing or evaporating in relevance.''∏∑ These
clinical and speculative exchanges on ethnic psychology, Hispanic
psychology, and political psychology reveal a tremendous disparity. A
culture criticism and ideology critique like Chow's or a legally
inﬂected critique like Ford's understands the consequences of accepting
the terms of being an ethnic-racialized subject in a way very different
from what is imagined by the ''clinical'' material as the major
stumbling block: weak ethnic-racialized identities--qua--egos. Let me
restate the central problem as this book has seen it: [we have developed
no language to talk about ethnic-racialized identity that is not
entirely ego- and social psychological and that does not imagine a
strong ego as the desired outcome in a racist, white supremacist
world.]{.underline}

The editors of Critical Race Theory write, ''We began to think of our
project as uncovering how law was a constitutive element of race itself;
in other words, how law constructed race.''π∑ My project agrees with
this assessment, but I would extend [the law]{.underline}'s reach a bit
more to suggest that it [also constructs ethnic-racialized subjects and
in this sense plays in concert with]{.underline} what Chow names
[''coercive mimeticism]{.underline}'' [by helping circulate scripts for
what it means to be a proper, that is, identiﬁable ethnic-racialized
subject worthy of protection.]{.underline} My position is like and
unlike the critical legal theory position that, in the editors' words,
is skeptical, even disdainful, of any political project organized around
race. One could say that any concerted effort to focus on race risks
reifying it. That's old news. I'm more concerned with addressing how
a[ny engagement with race by the legal apparatus produces a hollowed-out
subject, an ego- and social psychological subject, how the legal
apparatus encourages the sad imbecility of feeling compelled to resemble
that which is ethnicracialized and how it disseminates impoverished
readings of ethnic-racialized subjectivity over scores of
generations---its bullying effects---and how this affects social and
political movements staged by ethnic-racialized subjects.]{.underline}
It may be that justice for ethnic-racialized subjects in a white
supremacist society can be achieved only on the condition of the
exhaustive reduction of these subjects to social and cultural
explications, to the utter exclusion of understanding them as subjects
in language, subjects of the signiﬁer, subjects with an unconscious. The
following quotation by the legal theorist and scholar Richard T. Ford
echoes my own sentiment with respect to whether [the law,
dependent]{.underline} as it is [upon an ego- and social psychological
framework for theorizing the ethnicracialized subject that partly
reproduces the reductive and calculating logic of racism in the very act
of protecting disprized subjects from discrimination]{.underline}, can
ever guarantee social justice. Ford writes, ''I don't think law is
capable of resolving or banishing this contradiction. In that sense law
is incapable of guaranteeing social justice. Social justice for people
of color and for other stigmatized minorities will require a
revolutionary cultural transformation, one more sweeping and more
penetrating perhaps than any we've seen. Perhaps one more profound than
any society can achieve while remaining the same society.''π∏ Allow me
to speculate on what I think might set the ground work for a ''cultural
transformation.'' To begin with, we might react to Ford's claims by
noting---with a rather broad stroke---that [the revolutionary
transformation that will have to be effected will necessitate a
radically different theorization of ethnic-racialized
subjectivity]{.underline}---one that willfully refuses to allow these
questions to be ceded entirely to the social sciences, especially
psychology. In the essay, Ford develops a notion, ''compelled
performance'' that sheds important light on how Chow's theory of
''coercive mimeticism'' plays out in the legal apparatus. He writes,
''Contemporary multiculturalism worries a lot about 'silence,'
'absence,' and 'exclusion' but very little about 'speaking for others,'
'conscription,' and 'compelled performances.' If misrecognition is a
serious harm, then we must be concerned that legal recognition may go
wrong, misrecognizing already subordinated groups and codifying that
misrecognition with the force of law and the intractability of stare
decisis. We'd better be pretty sure that the traits the law recognizes
are the right ones.''ππ To translate this into the terms of my argument,
I would say that [since the law can recognize and codify only traits
based on ego- and social psychological notions, a profound
misrecognition is built into the law's ability to see and comprehend the
human subject as a rights-bearing subject.]{.underline} I'm not
suggesting that there is a pure line of vision that would perfectly
capture the traits of the subject in some brilliant and exasperating
explanation, as though that were even a desirable goal. To the contrary,
I am suggesting that [the law won't own up, can't own up to the fact of
misrecognition, denying the Lacanian lesson taught in the mirror stage
article, that ''misrecognition'' constitutes the very structure of
subjectivity.]{.underline} But ''misrecognition'' may simply be the
price to pay for ''protective custody,'' as Ford explains: ''[Cultural
or identity rights are a form of protective custody: the witness gets
protection, sure. The violent accused is thwarted in his plot to silence
the witness or exact revenge. But the price of protection is
incarceration]{.underline}.''π∫ Shifting gears somewhat abruptly in an
effort to link Lacan's theory of the subject who precipitates in the
Symbolic versus legal recognition's attempt to safeguard against the
very appearance of the subject in deference to the masterful ego
ensconced in the Imaginary, I want to transfer Ford's notion of
''incarceration'' into the context of the clinical setting, one gone
awry, where the analyst erroneously engages the analysand only along the
imaginary axis in Lacan's Schema L (ﬁgure 3), from one ego (a) to the
other, counterpart ego (a%), in effect incarcerating the analysand in
the Imaginary. The analyst failing to be fully imbued with the
understanding of the difference between the Symbolic and Imaginary
effectively prevents the appearance of the Subject (and the
unconscious), represented by the S in the upper left-hand corner. [What
emerges from this in the legal context is an ego politics of the
Imaginary.]{.underline} As I explained earlier in the book, the
Imaginary in Lacan is dominated by rivalry and hostility. Moreover, to
be trapped in the Imaginary, in addition to compelling a kind of social
psychosis, as Teresa Brennan argues in History after Lacan, radically
undermines the human subject's ability to make linkages and connections
between historical events--- undermines, in fact, the ability to
historicize, period. Brennan writes, And as we shall see, when Lacan
refers to making connections he says that the process is also one of
''rewriting history.'' To avoid confusion, it should be emphasized at
the outset that rewriting history, in the sense of making connections,
is for Lacan an attribute of the symbolic. His theory of history is an
account of how that symbolic activity, and a great deal else besides, is
curtailed by the imaginary ego's era. In other words, Lacan is
describing a speciﬁc era in history---that of the ego. But the era he is
describing is one that curtails historical thinking.πΩ Making
connections and links between historical events is threatened by the
interference generated by the Imaginary in symbolic relations. In the
1950s, Lacan saw the reduction of this interference as the primary
analytical goal. We might return now to [ego psychology and its role in
helping inscribe an image of ethnic-racialized subjectivity in the
letter of the law.]{.underline} Again, Martin Bergmann reminds us that
the ego psychologists who came to the United States seemed to forget
history: ''In spite of the emphasis on adaptation, the Hartmann group
showed surprisingly little interest in the outside world. Hitler, World
War II, and the Holocaust left no discernible impression on their
thinking. . . . Denying what happened in Europe appears to have been a
necessary defense for their adaptation to America.''∫≠ The ﬁeld of ego
psychology established in the United States is not only a symptom of the
ego's era, in whose language it speaks, it is also run through by a kind
of turning away from making historical links and connections[. The
codiﬁcation of an ego psychological understanding of ethnic-racialized
subjectivity in the service, ostensibly, of crafting legal forms of
social redress that correct upon a history of legal and extralegal
systemic racist practices, oddly enough, in that very move, accomplishes
a kind of refusal to engage this same history because of how it
theorizes these subjects only along the Imaginary, thus rendering the
project of making historical links and connections virtually
impossible.]{.underline} My argument in this chapter has insisted on the
intimate historical links between ego psychology, social psychology,
rights discourse, and the power of the state to weigh in on what
ethnic-racialized difference and psychological trauma means, as
predicated upon ego- and social psychological assumptions and tenets,
and why I think we're tragically stuck since we are fueled by the false
amplitudes that yield from being addressed as ego and only as ego. If it
appears to be the case that [legal and political recognition for
disprized ethnicracialized subjects in U.S. culture in the twenty-ﬁrst
century can be secured only to the extent that we be hallucinated as
psychological subjects at risk according to the Imaginary politics of
ego and social psychology, then employing a more Lacanian psychoanalytic
reading of ethnic-racialized subjects as rights-bearing subjects in
language would precipitate subjectivities that we probably wouldn't even
recognize.]{.underline} Returning to some of Judith Butler's language in
a passage quoted above, we might ask what price would have to be paid in
order to bring to a deﬁnitive close the U.S. legal dimension's
longstanding dependency on ego and social psychology in crafting visions
of ethnic-racialized subjectivity and experience in a white supremacist
society. Ford has a provisional answer to this question: ''It may be
that the price of providing our descendants with a world free of social
stigma and oppression of identities such as race, a world we could be
proud to call more just, is that they would not share our identities,
that they would be our heirs but not our descendants.''∫∞

#### Antiblack violence in the US is explained by the notion that the other has the illusory objet a, that which gives it wholeness. White American anger is directed towards black folk as a result of the fantasy that black folk are experiencing a kind of wholeness and excess joy that white people don't have access to in the afterlife of slavery.

Read from this book's Lacanian psychoanalytic perspective, Dunn's fears
facilitate analysis of not just race but also the core process of
othering2 that is constitutive of racial difference. [These fears point
to a deeper hatred of the other that is veiled by the restrictions upon
self-expression imposed by America's shifting discourses on race.
Blurring the lines between selfdefense and hatred, what today
complicates cases such as Dunn's and Zimmerman's is our increased
inability to account for racist motivations.]{.underline} Though African
Americans remain largely convinced that race continues to be a primary
factor in American life, as a result of the successes of the civil
rights movement, Americans have become more conscious of the moral
impropriety of racial bias. While this self-consciousness has led to
more respectful treatment of African Americans, it has also allowed
Americans to become more adept at a kind of self-policing that enables
the expression of racially biased opinions through the screen of
politically correct speech.3 In the supposedly postracial era initiated
by the presidency of Barack Obama, in which race purportedly no longer
matters, it is impolite both to express racist views and to accuse
others of racism. [Thus the discourse of race has shifted to such arenas
as culture, which recall race without naming it. This shift is what we
see particularly in the Dunn case, where rap music becomes the link of
association Dunn uses to bind African Americans to "thug culture" and
define them as criminals in need of violent disciplinary instruction in
proper conduct.]{.underline} Though masked within this shift, Dunn's
desire to discipline racial others subsumes his articulated motive of
fear under a deeper hatred of the racial other as true inspiration for
his actions. In evading direct reference to racial difference through a
focus upon the boys' "behavior" and the rap music they enjoy, [**[Dunn
simultaneously divulges a hatred of the other that extends beyond race
toward what Jacques Lacan calls the other's jouissance]{.mark}, or
enjoyment, [the very core around which,]{.mark} I suggest, [otherness
articulates itself]{.mark} to constitute racial** difference. [It is
against this jouissance that Dunn's actions must be read]{.mark}, and it
is [this jouissance that explains the possibility for hatred in
contemporary America to address itself at racial difference without need
of acknowledging this difference. Lacanian theory defines jouissance as
the pleasure made available to the subject through the mediation of
discourse, the pleasure availed this subject by his or her ability to
ground a psychic sense of the self as coherent, autonomous, and
self-controlled through use of the mechanisms of language and
fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Where Lacan reveals the subject to be
psychically split, most noticeably between the conscious and
unconscious, control over the discourses that define the self, and over
the environment this self occupies, becomes a means of veiling the gap
that fissures all individual subjectivity. [This book identifies white
racial identity as just such a discourse for white Americans, serving to
ground white identity in the jouissance of language and
fantasy.]{.underline} [Fueling Dunn's fears and hatred is apprehension
over the dwindling hegemony of this discourse. Information exposed in
Dunn's trial and in letters Dunn wrote from prison help to identify his
aggressive response to Davis and his friends as a form of aggressivity,
the aggression that emerges in the subject specifically upon recognition
of the fracturing of his or her self-image]{.underline}.4 In Dunn's
case, I would suggest, this fracturing is bound to a devaluing of the
sway of his personal and racial identity, a devaluing that Dunn senses
through his inability to dominate the space and interpersonal
environment he occupies.As Dunn returns to the Jacksonville neighborhood
he once knew but has not lived in for a number of years, what initiates
the conflict between Dunn and the teenage boys is his request that they
turn down the loud music that dominates this space. Dunn experiences a
frustration that seems bound to spatial restriction, as he sits parked
in a spot outside of the gas station's store that positions him in such
tight proximity to the boys' SUV and loud music that his own doors,
rattling from the pounding bass, could only open partially. The entire
incident seems to involve for Dunn a reversal in the natural order of
things, a restriction upon his entitled freedoms that only gets extended
by his imprisonment after the shooting. Expressing, after his arrest,
his frustration and uncertainty as to whether he "should feel like
\[he's\] a victim of reverse-discrimination or a political prisoner,"
Dunn is convinced that "either way" the "state of Florida is screwing
\[him\] over."5 Dunn remains self-assured that he is "being held,
illegally," because "the blacks" are "calling the shots, in the media
and the courts,"6 despite his contradicting assertion that "the jail is
full of blacks and they all act like thugs."7 Dunn designates the prison
he occupies with these blacks "Thugville,"8 asking, "Why am I here?"9
Though lamenting that it is "so sad in this day and age we're still
divided by race,"10 Dunn affirms, "I'm glad I don't live in
Jacksonville, the murder capitol \[sic\] of Florida."11 While both
distancing himself from the site of the murder and absolving himself of
blame for its commission, Dunn seeks to establish an exclusionary
identity defined by its discreet relation to place and by this
identity's disciplinary function over racial others who enter spaces he
seeks to control. Dunn declares, "This may sound a bit radical, but if
more people would arm themselves and kill these fucking idiots when
they're threatening you, eventually they may take the hint and change
their behavior."12 Correcting improper behavior is at the heart of
Dunn's actions and trial. Though Dunn's disciplinary actions are
addressed to black males, he speaks in a moralistic vein more acceptable
even to African Americans about cultural vices. Dunn argues, "I'm really
not prejudiced against race, but I have no use for certain cultures.
This gangster-rap, ghetto talking thug 'culture' that certain segments
of society flock to is intolerable. They espouse violence and disrespect
toward women."13 [Our ability to recognize the problematic relation
between rap music and the glorification of violence lends support to
Dunn's suggestion that his actions are not racist. But what Dunn's
remarks express is a hatred directed at rap music as a source of
enjoyment, or jouissance, that has come to be identified with black
Americans more broadly.]{.underline} Dunn takes part in a contemporary
discourse that binds difference not to the body but to jouissance.
[[**Difference may be isolated from the racial body in this manner
because it is ultimately jouissance that grounds difference**,
establishing this difference through its circumscription of the fantasy
object Lacan calls the object a]{.mark}. Most precisely, [jouissance
designates the pleasure that would emerge from an impossible
wholeness**.**]{.mark} **Lacan explains, however, that [in the face of
such impossibility the signifier serves as "the cause of jouissance,"
producing pleasure through its articulation of the fantasies of
wholeness,]{.mark} or being, that compensate for subjective lack.**14
This being, lost to the subject, is defined as a psychic sense of unity,
autonomy, and individuality that the subject can construct only through
the signifier's isolation of the object a, the illusory lost object that
promises to return the subject to a jouissancefilled state of
wholeness**. [In American society, this fantasy object a]{.mark}, I
argue[, is often racial identity, supporting both difference and
jouissance-inducing fantasies of being]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Within
the fantasies of the racialized subject, this object a of race, this
"object that puts itself in the place of what cannot be glimpsed of the
other" and the self, serves as the "basis of being," isolating an
imaginary core self that "holds the image \[of the racial body\]
together," granting it psychic and semantic significance for the
subject.]{.underline}15 Race, as object a, functions as what I would
call after Lacan the "para-being," the "being beside," which is
"substitute\[ed\] . . . for the being that would take flight."16 [[More
so than the physical body, it is racial identity as founded by this
illusory core being, the racial essence distinct to each racial group,
that provides structure and coherence to fantasies of
difference]{.underline}.]{.mark} [But where this a as racial core is
both illusory and thus elusive, what [racial fantasies ultimately
isolate as proof of the other's alterity is the other's
enjoyment]{.mark}, which is [perceived as an index of this other's
jouissance]{.mark}, a [reification of the bliss experienced by this
other through access to an illusory a.]{.mark} In racial fantasies, the
other's visible or even stylized expressions of pleasure, which are
exemplified so distinctly in music, come to define the other's
particular mode of jouissance, his or her specific manner of accessing
being. This visible enjoyment helps to construct the other as bound to a
distinctive jouissance of being that differentiates self from other and
racial group from racial group.]{.underline} Through the group's mode of
jouissance, its very being or core self is defined and its racial
identity is solidified. Racial alterity is thus often contextualized by
a fantastical sense of the incompatibility of the other's mode of
jouissance with that of the subjective self, or that of this self's
racial group; but the other's jouissance, bound to fantasy, actively
oscillates between subjective imaginings that designate it alternately
as alien and as excessive, and this jouissance can therefore also found
what Lacan terms "jealouissance," the frustrated hatred that may spring
forth from the subject upon conviction that the other "has the a" and
accesses a bountiful bliss the subject lacks.17 [Where hatred of the
other is fundamentally "addressed to being" and is essentially isolated
through the jouissance perceived in the other's manifest enjoyment, it
is toward the bountiful excesses of a visible pleasure alien to Dunn's
self-identity, an unrestrained jouissance of being expressed in the
boys' loud rap music and undisciplined behavior, that Dunn directs his
hatred and aggressivity]{.underline}

#### **I**nvestment in race as a unique signifier binds studies to the past, creating a process of repetition that leads to psychic trauma 

**George 16** [\[Sheldon George is a Professor of English and a scholar
of American and African American literature @ Simmons College. "Trauma

[[The limitation of most African American scholarly investigations of
race,]{.underline}]{.mark} I argue[, [is their allegiance to conceptions
of discourse, race, and agency that are framed not by psychoanalysis but
by poststructuralist]{.underline}]{.mark} [[criticism]{.mark}. Jacques
Derrida's poststructuralist argument that "centers" of meaning have "no
natural \[or\] fixed locus" but are secured instead by discourse
provides for the scholarship on race an anxiously alluring
appeal.]{.underline}1 [The anxiety associated with this theory emerges
because poststructuralism poses a challenge to the very concept of race
itself, which for many African American scholars provides both a sense
of identity and a route toward agency.]{.underline} As early as 1987
Barbara Christian, a pioneer of African American studies, articulated
the rationale for resisting this theory, observing that
poststructuralist critique of the center emerged "just when the
literature of peoples of color . . . began to move to 'the center.' "2
But, even when not explicitly employing poststructuralist theory,
African American scholars nevertheless mirror its signature processes of
decentering and discursively resignifying identity in their efforts to
establish race as a "social construct." [We see this, for example, in
the assertion of leading African American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.
that "precisely because 'blackness' is a socially constructed category,
it must be learned through imitation," and, most important for Gates, it
is therefore also open to "repetition and revision."3 This attempt to
revise race discursively is essential to African American theoretical
conceptions of agency; but, like poststructuralist models, it is limited
by its frequent failure to acknowledge and account for influences upon
race and the racial subject that lie outside of the structure imposed by
discourse.]{.underline} While this focus upon discourse directs much of
contemporary race theory toward analyses of what we may call after
Jacques Lacan the social Symbolic, Trauma and Race is an attempt not
only to articulate the impact of the discursive signifiers of race on
the unconscious of African Americans but also to circumscribe a
traumatic Real that escapes and indeed structures the agency of the
signifiers of the Symbolic. Lacan speaks of the Real as the excluded
center of the subject. [Coining [the term "extimate]{.mark}," [Lacan
defines the Real as that which simultaneously is most intimate, or
internal to the subject, and excluded from
symbolization]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 [[This]{.mark} extimate Real, I
suggest, [is what a theoretical focus solely upon discourse
misses**.**]{.mark} [**My work links this Real to slavery as an
exclusion within the social Symbolic that yet shapes the discourse of
race and indeed founds central aspects of African American and American
identity**.]{.mark} However, my interest is not so much in the history
of slavery as in the ineffable experience of jouissance---or excessive,
traumatizing pain and pleasure---that issues out of this Real past to
fuel the psychic desires and fantasies of Americans.]{.underline} Tying
this trauma to the fundamental trauma of subject formation, the
traumatic elision of being that occurs with the onset of subjectivity, I
read [[slavery]{.mark} as marking an upsurge of jouissance, such that
slavery [comes to signify a moment in time when the pleasures and pains
associated with being are open to manipulation by white Americans.
**What enables such manipulation is the concept of race itself, thus
constituted by slavery as an apparatus of jouissance that African
Americans today still struggle to control and manipulate**]{.mark}. But
[this]{.mark} precarious source of jouissance and being remains for
[African Americans an illusory object of attachment that binds them to
the unbearable past**.** ]{.mark}**Through the function of the
signifier,**]{.underline} I argue**[, [race enables a psychoanalytic
process of repetition that once again produces for African Americans the
psychic trauma of the Real.]{.mark} Maintaining]{.underline}**,
[therefore, that slavery has produced a historical legacy that is both
discursive and psychical, I turn to Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic
theory because his fundamental assertion that the "unconscious is
constituted by the effects of speech on the subject" offers a more
expansive understanding of the workings of the signifier than is
available in other theoretical models.]{.underline}5 Though indebted to
Freud for his ideas on the unconscious, much of Lacan's thinking on the
signifier emerges from a rereading of the seminal work in linguistics
and semiotics produced by Ferdinand de Saussure, a theorist whose
thinking also influenced Derrida. However, the divergences between
Lacan's and Derrida's theories offer radical implications both for how
we understand the effects of the past upon African Americans and for how
we conceptualize an African American agency meant to resist this past
and its continuing legacy. [Both Lacan and Derrida derive from Saussure
the notion that signifiers have no inherent meaning6 but instead produce
meaning by operating through what Lacan calls "themes of opposition" and
"functions of contrast and similitude."7]{.underline} Derrida advances
this Saussurian reading by reducing signification to "absolute chance"
and the "genetic indetermination" of the signifier, arguing that meaning
only ever accumulates as a "trace," as the by-product of differential
relations established between signifiers in their"movement \[along\] a
chain."8 [Where Lacan differs from both Saussure and Derrida is in his
understanding of the signifier as not arbitrary or indeterminate but
contingent upon causation that is external to the Symbolic.]{.underline}

[Focusing on this past, Du Bois presents us a narrative of the African
American racial self that we may say, with Lacan, "condense\[s\] in

structures the signifiers of both Du Bois' discourse and his
identity]{.underline}.43 [Lacan explains that "when the subject tells
his story, something acts, in a latent way, that governs \[his\] syntax

the deployment of racial identity and, more significantly, substitutes
race for another signifier with which race holds a metonymical relation:
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}[. T]{.mark}hese two signifiers, I suggest,
are linked within a signifying chain that thus ensures Du Bois' return
to race. [But the [signifier slavery that Du Bois chooses]{.mark} to
emphasize does not only recuperate his racial identity]{.underline};
more importantly, [it [links this identity to slavery's signifieds---
insult, discrimination, disaster. As this source of insult and injury,
slavery is the nucleus around which Du Bois' narrative and identity
condense]{.mark}.]{.underline} I say with Lacan that this "nucleus
refers to something traumatic," something beyond slavery itself that
"must be designated as belonging to the real" of subjective lack; and I
argue that Du Bois confronts this lack, as may contemporary African
Americans, precisely because he begins by embracing a hyperbolic,
historical relation to the signifiers of race and their injurious
signifieds.45 The Rhetorical Self, Dominated by the Signifier In his
rhetorical construction of the self as racial, Du Bois subjects himself
to a domination by the signifiers of race in ways that can be understood
in relation to Lacan's reading of the mechanisms of metaphor and
metonymy as central to subjective activity. [Lacan's work "links
metaphor to the question of being and metonymy to its lack."46 Metonymy
expresses what Lacan identifies as the "properly signifying function" of
language, the root effort of language to compensate for lack by routing
the subject's desire along a signifying chain in which desire is
"eternally extending toward the desire for something
else."]{.underline}47 This something else is the plenitude of being that
the subject seeks continually to find through the metonymical movement
of language, through both the "transfer of signification" from one word
to another within a signifying chain and the transfer of desire from one
object to another as value and meaning are cast upon them by the
signifier.48 It is this metonymical revaluing of race so as to retain it
as a means of compensating for lack that we see in Du Bois. [Born in
what he defines as "the century when the walls of race were clear and
straight" and "there was no question of exact definition and
understanding of the word," Du Bois eventually comes to question "the
concept of race" because it "has so changed and presented so much
contradiction."]{.underline}49 [[Insofar as Du Bois reaches toward race
as that which promises to fill lack, he struggles with these
contradictions, shifting metonymically from the biological to the
sociohistorical and eventually coming full circle through the signifier
slavery to ground his identity in this very
contradiction.]{.mark}However, the nature of this contradiction is such
that it allows Du Bois a restrictive understanding of both his
historical and his psychic self. In pinning his identity to slavery, Du
Bois moves from the operations of metonymy to a metaphorical process
whereby slavery is substituted as the dominating signifier for his
(racial) identity. **[Where metaphor involves the substitution of the
signifier for that which it names, the function of metaphor is to
remanifest being, to give presence, through language, to
absence]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Most notable through the subject's
self-representation in the signifier of his or her proper name, metaphor
allows for the emergence of the lost being in the only form through
which it may manifest itself, as what Lacan refers to as "the being of
signifierness."]{.underline}**50 This lost being is thus the signified
implied in the signifier of the subject's proper name.** [But what we
see in Du Bois is how the signifier of slavery restructures his
subjective relation to being. In Du Bois' narrative, slavery functions
as a dominating master signifier that delineates the meaning of Du Bois'
racial identity. Not only does it substitute itself for Du Bois' proper
name as the signifier that will structure Symbolic representation of his
(racial) being, but **it also conflates this being with the injury,
insult, and discrimination both he and the nonwhite world suffer today
and have suffered in the past, thus bonding them in a common identity**.
This substitution of identity and conflation of feelings is explained by
a Lacanian understanding of metaphor as that which brings to a halt the
metonymical sliding of desire and meaning through manifestation of a
more lasting substitution, a "conjunction of two signifiers" for which
there is "the greatest disparity of the images
signified."]{.underline}**51 S disparity of the signified is what we see
in Du Bois when slavery, the new master signifier of his identity,
structures Du Bois' personal feelings and sense of being, in what he
calls a "later reaction" to racism, around racial feelings that belong
to all nonwhites. Slavery is able to produce this disparity that
organizes his sliding feelings because metaphor does not involve
juxtaposition of two equally actualized signifiers but is instead a
process in which one signifier has "replaced the other" in "the
signifying chain."**[52 In such juxtaposition, the substituting
signifier of slavery suppresses other signifiers of identity, so that
they remain present only "by virtue of \[their\] (metonymic) connection
to the rest of the chain," while it simultaneously delimits and occludes
the signifieds that emerge as an expression of this identity's psychic
and emotional reality.]{.underline}**53 In Du Bois' discussion of his
feelings toward Negroes and Africa, these personal feelings are
themselves the signifieds that will express and further elide his being,
articulating this being around the substitute signifier slavery that
displaces the multiple signifiers of Du Bois' personal identity with its
dominating historical context**

#### Signifiers of race rearticulate the subject's sense of self around a lack that was once defined in the past, repeating the trauma of slavery into the present 

**George 16** [\[Sheldon George is a Professor of English and a scholar

and Race: A Lacanian Study of African American Racial Identity". Baylor

[The cause that Trauma and Race demarcates is what I call the jouissance
of slavery, a psychic experience of trauma that emerges from the past
and repeats itself in the present through the agency of the
signifier.]{.underline} [It is the signifier that establishes the link
through which this traumatic cause, germane to the slave's experience
and not to that of his or her descendant, intrusively establishes its
place in the internal lives of African Americans. The signifier defines
the category of race, allowing for a conscious association of African
Americans with a chain of signifiers that links them to the brutal
historical past.]{.underline} [This linkage confronts African Americans
not only with the terrible history itself but also with a traumatic lack
that, I will argue, was made manifest by slavery]{.underline}**. [[What
the signifiers of race do,]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore[, [whether
emanating from the racist other or whether willfully embraced as a
source of identity, is rearticulate the subject's sense of self around
an unveiled lack once defined in the racist past]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Thus, I maintain, [[the discursive linking of African American identity
to this past becomes the means through which the trauma of slavery is
repeated in the experiences of African Americans]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
From Resignification to the Barred Subject The anticonceptual cause of
which I speak, this more than historical jouissance of slavery, is
precisely what is ignored by both Derridean poststructuralism and
leading African American scholars like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Houston
Baker. [At the heart of these scholars' work is [a focus on the Symbolic
that actively limits African American agency and identity to]{.mark}
what we may call after Judith Butler "[resignification]{.mark}," the
effort "to lay claim" to the terms that define us "precisely because of
the way these terms, as it were, lay their claim on us prior to our full
knowledge."]{.underline}11 Butler's Derridean approach to agency and the
challenges she recognizes in it are useful for shedding light on the
mirroring route embraced by African American scholars. [Working, like
Butler, with a conceptualization of the Symbolic as a closed system in
which existent signifiers can only be resignified and recirculated,
these scholars confront a particular problematic that can be articulated
as the prospect of "forging a future from resources inevitably
impure."]{.underline}[12 [Without a viable methodology by which newness
can enter into the Symbolic,]{.underline}]{.mark} [by which something
alien to the system can either be introduced into it or act upon it,
[the challenge]{.mark} these scholars come to embrace [is how to
rearticulate the terms of race "that \[once\] signaled degradation" so
that they can now "signify a new and affirmative set of meanings," so
that this "reversal" is not one that "retains and reiterates the
abjected history of the term."]{.mark}]{.underline}13 It is this focus
on resignification that we see, for example, in [Gates' famous theory of
"the signifying monkey,"]{.underline} which [defines a discursive
practice of resistance that is grounded in a "formal revision" that
"turns on repetition of formal structures, and their
difference."]{.underline}14 Disregarding the psychoanalytic notion of
repetition as tied to the unconscious and Real, Gates views African
American culture as involved in continual efforts to produce a
"chiasmus," or what Gates articulates as a process of "repeating and
simultaneously revising in one deft, discursive act."15 Gates relies,
ultimately, on a model of agency that Derrida calls after Levi-Strauss
"bricolage": the process of making use of "the instruments \[one\] finds
at \[one's\] disposition around \[oneself\], those which are already
there," in one's attempt to, by "trial and error, adapt them" to a use
for "which \[they\] had not been especially conceived."16 [Though Gates
seeks to imagine a beyond of this bricolage and reach outside of the
American Symbolic by asserting that African Americans must turn to their
own "black vernacular tradition" itself in their efforts to "
'deconstruct,' if you will, the ideas of difference inscribed in the
trope of race," **Gates limits agency to language, arguing that we must
"take discourse itself as our common subject.**]{.underline}"17 [[Both
Gates and Baker bind African American political resistance to language
and thus also to the Symbolic]{.mark}, with Baker viewing the slave
narrative and historical figures like Booker T. Washington as embracing
a politics of "liberating manipulation" and "revolutionary renaming"
that employs language as a "black defense against and revision of
ancient terrors, mistaken identities, dread losses]{.underline}."[18 In
the view of an African American theory of race shaped by the work of
thinkers like Gates and Baker, this revisionary repetition has been and
continues to be a means for blacks to alter the social structure of a
racist Symbolic.]{.underline} This effort at resignification is laudable
and indeed necessary. But **[[the problem with a theoretical focus on
the Symbolic is that it does not acknowledge how what is extimate may
impact]{.mark} upon [the Symbolic and the discursive activities of the
subject beyond his or her conscious volition,]{.mark} [and neither does
it offer a direct means to address the scars that may be left on the
subject's psyche through the operations of racism within this
Symbolic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, it may be argued that **[[what
is missed in such a focus on the Symbolic is the very psychoanalytic
subject him- or herself.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As Lacan states, "the
subject is not the one who thinks" or speaks through discourse.19
Lacan's work continually returns to a critique of what he calls "the
I-cracy," or "myth" of "the I that masters" discourse, the myth of the
"speaker" that "is identical to itself."20 [Known for his focus on the
split subject, Lacan counters the I-cracy by asserting that "the point"
is "to know whether, when I speak of myself, I am the same as the self
of whom I speak."21 In opposition to the speaking subject of the
I-cracy, Lacan "identifies the subject with that which is originally
subverted by the system of the signifier]{.underline}."22 [What Lacan
points to is "the function of barring, the striking out of another
thing" that his theory establishes as inherent in the subject's relation
to the Other's signifiers]{.underline}. **[[It is this process by which
something essential to the subject is stricken from him or her
that]{.mark} I propose [enables an understanding of the effects of
slavery upon both the slave and contemporary African
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Lacanian theory shows that all
subjects are constituted through the Other's signifiers. More precisely,
[the subject]{.underline}, Lacan argues, [can only emerge as a
signifier. Lacan notes that because language "exists prior to each
subject's entry into it," the subject is "the slave of a discourse" in
which "his place is already inscribed at his birth."]{.underline}24
Gaining subjectivity and meaning through those "themes of opposition"
and "functions of contrast and similitude" that we have already seen are
essential to the operations of the signifier, "this subject," Lacan
asserts, "which, was previously nothing if not a subject coming into
being---solidifies into a signifier."25 The function Lacan ascribes to
the Symbolic and its signifiers is that of producing the aphanisis of
the subject, her or his "fading" or "disappearance" under the
signifier's agency.26 [Subjectivity not only restricts the subject to
the Other's preexistent universe of meaning; it also deprives the
subject of access to those essential components of the self that cannot
be circumscribed by signification, the unconscious and Real as the
barred or stricken portions of the self that constitute the fundamental
lack of subjectivity**. Where Lacan's work is particularly useful is in
providing a comparative framework through which we may distinguish a
heightened aphanisic effect of the signifier upon the slave, a barring
that often is again manifested for African Americans as an internal lack
when accosted by acts of racism.**]{.underline} Lacan argues that what
each "subject has to free himself of is th\[is\] aphanisic effect of the
. . . signifier."27 This ethical stance fundamental to Lacanian theory
coincides with my own efforts in Trauma and Race to imagine an agency
beyond the Symbolic.

#### The affirmative defines race as a unique signifier, while the function of religion during slavery proves the notion that race itself merely functions as an objet a -- empirics. The affirmative is a project of resignification that attempts to reclaim notions of blackness -- this is an illusory and impossible fantasy

[Race,]{.underline} I propose, [is an object a established around lack
as much for African Americans as it is for whites.]{.underline} **[The
function of the object a]{.underline}** Lacan outlines in his reading of
the fort-da **[is not only to signify loss but also to displace it
through acts of repetition, to reassociate traumatic entrance into the
Symbolic with a temporally and qualitatively distinct moment of trauma
later experienced in the Symbolic.]{.underline}** In place of the
subject's traumatic division in language, the mother's departure from
the room becomes temporally defined as the cause of the split or
"Spaltung in the subject," which is then repetitively represented as the
true source of loss that is also "overcome by the alternating game,
fort-da."98 I read [slavery as serving the function of repetition for
African Americans]{.underline} that Lacan here assigns to the mother's
departure, [as the Symbolic and temporal signifier of a traumatic loss
that is more deeply psychic. Slavery comes to serve this function
because it eruptively displays psychic lack.]{.underline} Lacan defines
repetition as "the commemoration of an irruption of jouissance."99 Where
this irruption designates a breach inward and a splitting of the
subject, I identify in slavery a simultaneous eruption or outpouring of
jouissance that finds its Symbolic representatives across distances of
time through the signifiers of race[. I suggest that **both these
residual signifiers (even when redefined by African Americans) and the
acts of racism that** may grow out of them **are repetitions** that
function in relation to the jouissance of this past that both displaces
and displays psychic lack. Slavery's exhibition of the slave's lack and
its insistence upon the master's exultant and autonomous being produced
within the Symbolic a certain excess or surplus of jouissance, enabling
discursive and power structures through which access to jouissance
became unusually open to manipulation. Slavery thus marks a traumatic
moment in which jouissance as both lack and excess is
localized.]{.underline} [This eruption of jouissance thereby positions
slavery as a temporal representative of the lack that is the Lacanian
Real**. It is the signifiers of race that help to both localize this
lack temporally and bind it to the identity of those subjects who come
to be called African Americans.**]{.underline} [The concept of race came
to center African American identity because it not only augmented the
signifier's essential function of striking being from the subject,
actively restricting the slave's access to fantasies of self, but also
presented itself as an object of contention that promised to
re-establish the illusory existence of this being.]{.underline} As is
true in the case of the child of the fort-da, [the signifier, as
designator of the object a, is ever a protective source of identity, and
so race is often exceedingly empowering for African
Americans.]{.underline} In slavery and beyond, it offers subjects a
sense of direction, belonging, and self-worth. But **[race alone could
guarantee neither community nor being for enslaved
blacks.]{.underline}** [To truly understand the notion of being that
slaves were able to construct for themselves]{.underline} and to
appreciate the jouissance of suffering to which this being yet binds
contemporary African Americans, [we must look to the function of
religion in slavery]{.underline}. **[Because efforts during slavery to
resignify race were especially open to contention, enslaved blacks were
slow to embrace race truly as a source of being.]{.underline}** And so,
in truth, [the nascent African American identity that began to cohere in
times of slavery more often employed religion both to contend against
and to positively resignify race in an effort to constitute this being,
thus setting the stage for an emphasis on religion in African American
culture that is yet present today]{.underline}. What we find **[in
slavery]{.underline}** is that **[the unity developed by enslaved blacks
emerged not primarily because of a sense of their "racial"
commonality]{.underline}** but because blacks were bound together by a
common circumstance that both accentuated existing similarities across
the group and demanded this unification as a source of resistance and a
means of survival.100 More likely to recognize differences within the
racial group than the masters who asserted the power to define the
group[, individual slaves formed alliances and group affiliations that
were more nuanced than any allowed by the category of race.]{.underline}
The slave narrative of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, who spends much
of his enslavement on a merchant ship before landing in New York City,
supports this point, displaying the internal differences among slaves
that prevented their easy unification around race as a source of being.
Gronniosaw's inability to identify with the other slaves in his new
master's household not only leads to his conviction that the "servants
were all jealous, and envied \[him\] the regard, and favour, shewn
\[him\] by \[his\] master" but also facilitates his construction of a
narrative that asserts God will not save Gronniosaw's fellow blacks or
"those born under every outward Disadvantage, and in Regions of the
grossest Darkness and Ignorance" if they lack "knowledge of the
\[biblical\] Truth."101 Written after he is freed and no longer has even
the common circumstance of a mutual enslavement to link him to the
larger slave community, Gronniosaw's narrative seeks support not for
members of this community but for his own starving family in dire need
of money. Gronniosaw's narrative maintains that through the bondage
under which members of his race still exist, the "Lord undertook to
bring" Gronniosaw "out of Darkness into His marvelous light."102 What
Gronniosaw's religious rhetoric shows is that race by itself could not
unify slaves or fully promise them being; functioning at times in direct
opposition to race, within and beyond slave communities, it was
primarily religion that made this promise. Such a focus by slaves like
Gronniosaw on religion as the source of the object a that grounded being
must be read within the context of a broader slaveholding society that
celebrated the Christian view of God as the Supreme Being, a view
expressed in the biblical statement "I am the one who is," by which,
Lacan notes, "God asserts his identity with Being."103 The object a,
Lacan shows, is that which presents itself as not just a semblance of
being but also being's "remainder."104 [From this Lacanian perspective,
we may read the a as the source of the soul that, for the Christians to
whom Gronniosaw addresses his narrative, links mankind to the true
Supreme Being; this a functions as the divine remnant at the core of
man, the spiritual essence, shaped by God's own hands, that transcends
man's earthly existence.]{.underline} Both within man and external to
man, this extimate core as object a is what sets man on the path of a
true love of his neighbor as the self. It is the source of a kind of
love that Lacan calls "soul loving," whereby subjects "love each other
as the same in the Other," aiming this love at the extimate object a
that is both absent from the self and illusorily present in the
other.105 Where Gronniosaw wishes to establish the similarity of his
soul to that of his white reader's through use of his religious
rhetoric, he struggles against a racism that functions to define his
core self as blackened by the absence of God's light, as devoid of the
soul's divine spark. This struggle emerges because the soul loving he
beseeches of the white other is equally, I would argue, the root of race
love, whereby individuals of the same race come to love each other as
mirrored images of the self, finding in each other the same object the
self pursues, the object belonging to the self that is absent from the
self. This absence fuels a desire for racial unification and solidarity
that stands at odds with the universalism ostensibly glorified by
religious soul loving of the neighbor. I will show in chapters 2 and 3
how [race comes to supplant religion as a source of this core object a
that offers African Americans a semblance of being, but what we find in
Gronniosaw's narrative is race as an impediment to any loving of the
neighbor's soul]{.underline}. [Within slavery, race both obstructed
cross-racial unity and impaired creation of an extimate object a capable
of unifying blacks intersubjectively into a group identity]{.underline}.
[Because race was the root of slavery's assertion of the nonbeing of the
slave, race had to be redefined and buttressed by religion for it to
function as a source of being. Not only religion but also communal
activities like group worship or singing and working together all helped
to create the unified group to which this being could be assigned.106
Establishing unity through communal activity, religion and spiritual
slave songs were especially important to both the reformation of slave
identity and the gradual development of notions of race as possible
sources of being.]{.underline} Emblematic of this fact is Lawrence
Levine's observation that "the single most persistent image of the slave
songs is that of \[African Americans as\] the chosen people."107
[**Through attempting to supplant the authority of the slave master with
that of God, slaves sought to recast the veil of fantasy over the
psychic place of lack uncovered by the institution of slavery.**
Religion became the source of a fantasy grounded more in the patriarchs
of the Old Testament than in race, allowing for identification with
heroes like Moses, Joshua, Jonah, and Noah, who were delivered from
their own suffering and that of the world around them. Through such
fantasies, the slave's suffering could be contextualized as proof of a
unique access to being, as proof of one's divine selection for
salvation.]{.underline} This is precisely what we see in Gronniosaw, who
asserts, "I am willing, and even desirous of being counted as nothing,"
for "I know that . . . every trial and trouble that I've met with . . .
\[has\] been sanctified to me."108 Gronniosaw takes the concept of the
chosen to its extreme, articulating his worthiness of financial aid from
others through a demonstration of his position of distinction from all
sinners, white and black. Seeking to constitute himself as a chosen one
by rhetorically severing this religiously sanctified self from
established notions of race, Gronniosaw simultaneously distances himself
particularly from other blacks because he realizes that as race augments
the notion itself of a group identity it also implicitly contests the
fantasies religion allows. Though these revivifying religious fantasies
of being often promised salvation in this world, and not just the next,
the limits of the agency they covenanted were displayed in the ability
of slave masters to themselves bind race to religion in order to justify
notions of white supremacy. Such biblical events as Noah's cursing of
the descendants of his son Ham to forever become the servants of all
other men were significant to this process. Through this story, whites
could not only promote the association of blacks with Ham, whose name
"is a vulgarization of Cham," or ch'm, the Hebrew word for black, but
also present black skin as the sign of a servitude and cursed suffering
that was divinely sanctioned.109 This suffering, bound to race, is
merely the obverse of that constructed in the rhetoric of Gronniosaw.
[What we see through such contention over race and suffering is that
African Americans encounter continuous obstacles in the construction of
their fantasy of being through reliance upon the apparatus of race.
Because race as object a today still remains discursively tied to the
trauma it attempted to compensate for in slavery, African American
identity ever circles this traumatic past, defined by a suffering that
the concept of racial identity alternately attempts to alleviate and
traumatically unfurls.]{.underline}As Lacan notes, "There is nothing
more difficult than separating a word from discourse. . . . As soon as
you begin at this level, the whole discourse comes running after
you."110 [**Still able to function as a stigma for African Americans,
what the word "race" marks is a fantasy difference that not only
discursively justified the master's brutal and traumatic scarring of the
slave's flesh and psyche but also still today repeats its long
historical function of signifying the lack of some quality needed to
make African Americans the equals of whites**. It is therefore no
surprise that the process initiated by slaves of forming for blacks a
protective group identity demanded the unifying function of music and
communal activities like religious worship, and could not rely solely
upon the efforts to resignify race]{.underline} that we see praised by
African American academics like Gates and Baker. As scholars such as Ron
Eyerman have demonstrated[, African American racial identity could only
be truly solidified as a discursive concept after slavery ended, at the
moment post-Reconstruction when an emerging black middle class and
intelligentsia had finally attained sufficient levels of agency over
discourse to employ race in calls for political unity]{.underline}.111
[While most African American scholarship repeats endlessly this early
attempt by the intelligentsia and the slaves themselves to resignify and
politically redeploy race, Trauma and Race suggests a need finally to
advance beyond mere resignification.]{.underline} [**What
resignification today entails is an ambivalent scholarly desire to
maintain race that is actively facilitated by conceptualizations of
agency and identity as discursive, a desire to uphold race while also
depriving it of a lethal essentialism that is often the core of
racism**. This ambivalence suggests race's position not only as a
fantasy object, or object a, but also as a Symbolic remnant, as a
link--- often willfully preserved by scholars---to the traumatic Real of
slavery's jouissance]{.underline}. By contrast, **[Trauma and Race seeks
to articulate a notion of agency and identity that distances itself from
both race and the traumatic past it incorporates.]{.underline}**

What we find in both Du Bois and Outlaw, I suggest, [is an effort to
conserve race beyond its referential value and an attachment to race
that extends beyond the logic]{.underline} of these individuals'
arguments. Part of the reason for this adherence to race [is a dogged
belief that, despite the conceded lack of scientific basis for race,
this concept does indeed have some perceivable referential
value.]{.underline} [Du Bois himself argues that a "scientific
definition of race is impossible," for "physical characteristics are not
so inherited as to make it possible to divide the world into races."10
But race asserts its existential veracity through appeal to the eyes,
through assertion of a natural and visible difference, marked in skin
color, that helps to seduce equally Du Bois and Outlaw into compliance
with racial thinking.]{.underline} It is [this seductive visibility of
race, this "common sense" evidence from "everyday life,"]{.underline} as
Outlaw puts it, [that we must first come to terms with in understanding
the compelling attachment to race maintained by African Americans like
Outlaw and Du Bois. Though race is a discursive construct, one that I
argue is inspired by psychic urgencies, race remains compelling to the
eyes because racial differences emerge from a grafting of the meanings
of the Symbolic onto biology]{.underline}. It is this propensity of race
to conflate the Symbolic's discourses with biology that Du Bois and
Outlaw promote in clustering race as both sociohistorical and
biological. **[Emerging from the intersection of biology and the
Symbolic, race does not manufacture difference but instead structures a
prescribed mode of interpretation that grants forms of existent
biological difference more critical Symbolic value.]{.underline}** The
biological fact of phenotypic variations functions in racial discourse
as race's alibi, masking the inherent arbitrariness of racial
distinction by internalizing and eternalizing difference as an embodied
permanency. Because phenotypic differences in pigmentation and
morphological variations in bone and hair are often traceable through
ancestral lines, these visible differences provide an ostensive basis
for a biological notion of race as defined by inheritable
characteristics. However, as the history of racial passing in this
country attests, such characteristics do not always correlate in
predictable ways with racial identity. Though, by grounding itself in
the biology of phenotype, race comes to imply deeper dissimilarities in
such things as morality, intellect, degrees of licentiousness, violent
proclivities, and so on, it **[is the system of the Symbolic itself that
grants race and these implied dissimilarities their value, establishing
a differential status that has meaning only within a chain where black
adopts its Symbolic significance through its interrelation with and
distinction from white]{.underline}**. [Precisely by grafting itself
onto biology, however, race presents itself as pre-dating the system of
the Symbolic, masquerading as an inherent component of nature indicative
of visible, natural variations in groups of humans. **This ability to
grant permanency to difference through biology is both what enables race
to function as the accomplice of psychic fantasies aimed at jouissance
and what Outlaw attempts to reinforce by defining race as a cluster
concept.**]{.underline} Though Outlaw contends that racism today is
caused by "invidious conceptualizations of raciality and ethnicity" and
that therefore today "we desperately need . . . settled and widely
shared knowledge" of "empirically and socially appropriate
identification of persons and groups," Outlaw does not embrace the
cluster concept for its empirical or social appropriateness.12
Recognizing that race's lack of scientific grounding makes it a concept
that will always be "subject to challenge and change," Outlaw admittedly
embraces the "cluster concept" definition of race for its fluidity and
its ability to account for "variation across time and space"; he
embraces this definition because it allows him to maintain race and
racial distinctions.13 We note most visibly the contradiction in
Outlaw's argument when he asserts that the "continued existence of
discernible racial/ ethnic communities of meaning is highly desirable,
even if, in the very next instance, racism and invidious ethnocentrism
in every form and manifestation were to disappear forever."14 If [race,
though failing to define its referent, is yet needed to achieve "social
peace and harmony" in the face of invidious racism, why this compulsion
to maintain race once racism disappears forever?]{.underline}15 It would
seem that what Outlaw seeks is not to establish communities of meaning
but to maintain racial communities forged by the memory of this very
history of race and racism Outlaw seeks to overcome.

In such warfare[, it is the dominating substitute signifier that
coheres]{.underline} and grants [structure to the sentimental mass of
the signified]{.underline}. **[Slavery as signifier comes to organize
both desire and identity]{.underline}** for Du Bois because slavery
"crystallizes" his feelings and sense of self in what Lacan calls a
"dialectic that has as its centre a bad encounter."58 In psychoanalysis,
the bad encounter is a "traumatizing" confrontation in the life of the
subject that assumes an "organizing function for development" because it
produces an awareness of lack.59 In Du Bois' case, however, the bad
encounter of slavery that organizes his personal biography is external
to his biographical experiences. [Slavery allows for the historicizing
and]{.underline}, thus, [depersonalizing of both being and
lack]{.underline} for Du Bois. [This historicizing becomes possible
because the racism of slavery that attempted to elide the being of
slaves by pinning subjective lack exclusively to them also produced
slavery as a central historical representative of subjective
lack]{.underline} for later generations of African Americans. **[Racial
identity itself]{.underline}**, **[whether imposed]{.underline}** by
racism **[or willfully embraced]{.underline}** by contemporary African
Americans **[as the historical context for self-understanding and
being]{.underline}**, [not only crystallizes for African Americans the
indisputable link between slavery and the racism they continue to suffer
but also may collapse their personal sense of being with the historical
lack emerging from slavery. Racism is key to this
conflation]{.underline}. In repeating a process whereby the African
American subject's relation to being is again questioned, as it was in
slavery, [racism grounds the African American subject's psychic sense of
lack not in the split self but in the racial past.]{.underline} This
crystallization of identity through the bad encounter of slavery is
therefore what redefines Du Bois' own desires by obfuscating lack. Du
Bois models the process by which slavery and racial identity may
displace African Americans' relation to both lack and being. [Lacan ties
the subject's loss of being to the exclusion from the Symbolic of those
aspects of the subject that defy linguistic circumscription, the drives
and desires of the subject that evade representation even in the very
process of the subject's articulation of his or her
demands.]{.underline} The root of these core drives and desires is the
libido as "an internal" tension, a "constant force" that registers what
the "sexed being loses in sexuality" upon entrance into the Symbolic.60
Initially "polymorphous, aberrant," the emerging subject is able to
attain pleasure through multiple sources, but sexuality and the
signifier both step in to define the regions of the body and the objects
of the Symbolic through which the sexed subject may attain pleasure.61
As a result, the constant force of the libido achieves Symbolic
expression only as "partial drives," emerging with only "that part of
sexuality that passes into the networks of the constitution of the
subject, into the networks of the signifier."62 As "the most profound
lost object," the libido, manifested as an aphanisis of being, fuels
desire and sexuality such that it is through pursuit of a mate that the
subject attempts typically to compensate for lack, seeking out in love
the person who possesses the illusory lost object that will fulfill him
or her and make him or her, fantastically, whole again.63 However,
[African Americans]{.underline} like Du Bois, [who ground their identity
primarily in race, relate to this fantasy of wholeness on a grander
scale.]{.underline} As we see above, when he reaches the point of "ultra
'race' loyalty," what compensates for lack in Du Bois is not a
connection with a mate but membership in a larger race. In this moment,
[desire is most directly grounded in the substitute signifier slavery
that organizes the sentimental continuum away from personal lack and
toward an external bad encounter that presents itself as a fixing
manifestation of loss for all members of the race.]{.underline} Because
slavery has so bound loss to race, **[race itself becomes the illusory
object upon "which the drive closes" in its pursuit of
wholeness]{.underline}**.64 Beyond love of a mate, [love of the race
becomes the primary means of curing whatever ails the
subject]{.underline} and fulfilling all of Du Bois' desires as he begins
to define all lack and all suffering as racial.

#### White jouissance is only achieved through racialized ends. Empirical examples like the shooting of Jordan Davis, prove how white people aim to fill the lack through racism.

[We begin to circumscribe the function of race with regard to this
fantasy by inquiring into the source of the cross-temporal resilience of
notions of race in America. The relation, in particular, of African
Americans to race reveals a noticeable paradox. Though direct or
indirect reference to race is the central means through which
discrimination of African Americans has been justified in America,
African Americans most often embrace the concept of their own racial
identity. Emerging from the successes of the Civil Rights Movement, an
identity politics based on unification along racial lines continues to
hold sway for African Americans. Whatever credence they give to the
existential value of race, African Americans frequently argue for race's
value in a sort of poststructuralist approach to agency, whereby the
subject must seek to appropriate and redefine the signifiers that define
the subject. This is the approach extolled by renowned African American
scholar Houston Baker, who declares that African Americans should
embrace a politics of "liberating manipulation" and "revolutionary
renaming" (1989, p. 25) that employs language as a "black defense
against and revision of ancient terrors, mistaken identities, dread
losses]{.underline}" (2001, p. 5). [What I suggest, however, is that
race holds such appeal even for African Americans because the losses
against which it defends are not merely social, but also
psychic.]{.underline}1 [Adherence to race is directed by an effort to
recover what I would call an illusion of being. Being is what the
subject loses of herself through entrance into the world of language
that Lacan called the Symbolic. Forced to exist within this Symbolic,
the subject is alienated from her being, from all aspects of the self
that escape submission to the hermeneutics of the signifier in its
ability to define and name the subjective self that always extends
beyond language. This self is what is mourned through a search for the
Lacanian object a, the fantasy object within the Symbolic, often pinned
to the other as mate, that promises the subject comple- tion. But it is
also, I suggest, what is pinned to the racial other, as a living medium
through which fantasies of race articulate for the subject an illusory
relation to being. In such fantasies, the racial other can be
constituted as comprised of a being totally different from the
subjective self. Lacan made the striking assertion that "a solid hatred
is addressed to being" (1998a, p. 99). In the American Symbolic,
structured by a history of racism, what urges subjects toward a process
of racial othering through use of ready-made fantasies of race is
precisely the attempt to establish the self's and the other's divergent
relations to being.]{.underline} The subject most effectively
establishes the other's relation to being by pinning fantastical meaning
to the other's perceived jouissance, or mode of enjoyment -- the
pleasures and actions which may signal to subjects that this other has
the a, the fantasy object that grants completion. Inherent in the racism
of today, I argue, is the recycling of signifiers of the past that
incorporate notions of African Americans' relation to a distinctly
different jouissance of being[. We see this, for example, in the recent
shooting of Jordan Davis, an African American teenage boy who was shot
at ten times and killed by a white man named Michael Dunn because Davis
and his friends were parked in a gas station playing their rap music too
loud for Dunn's liking. Aiming his hatred at their particular form of
jouissance and arguing that "this gangster-rap, ghetto talking thug
'culture' that certain segments of society flock to is intolerable"
(February 20th), Dunn shot at the boys because, he says, "the way they
behaved" in response to his request that they turn down the music was
"obnoxious," causing him to conclude that "everybody in the car was a
thug or a gangster" (Trial, Day 5). Admitting to possibly "imagining"
that the boys had a gun, Dunn grounds his fears of the boys in fantasies
that define their jouissance as other, dangerous: he explains, "You
know, you hear enough news stories and you read about these things, they
go through your mind" (Trial, Day 5). The circulation of "these things"
in the minds of Americans is rooted in a Symbolic that remains bound to
signifiers of the past that secured a sense of being for white
Americans. The specific experience of slavery, I argue, produced an
eruptive surplus of illicit jouissance for white Americans, a surplus of
pleasure that flooded this past and still threatens to saturate the
present. Where Lacan defined jouissance as fundamentally "evil" for its
unbending drive toward the bliss of being, jouissance designates a
pleasure beyond the Symbolic, one for which the subject will destroy
both the self and the other who occupy this Symbolic]{.underline} (1997,
p. 184[). It is by making jouissance accessible through the suffering
body of the black racial other that slavery produced a particular mode
of enjoyment, a way of accessing pleasure that resounds in the present.
At the heart of this mode of jouissance is the oppression of black
others whose supposed inferiority secures for white Americans a notion
of superiority and greater being. Where the a that signals a relation to
being is only imagined, jouissance as a visible mode of enjoyment that
distinguishes self from other, and racial group from racial group,
functions as an index of being. But the fantasy a, this "object that
puts itself in the place of what cannot be glimpsed of the other," is
the true source of this other's alterity (1998a, p. 63).]{.underline}
Through the object a, race functions as what I would call, after Lacan,
the "para-being," the "being beside," which is "substitute\[d\]\...for
the being that would take flight" (p. 44). This para-being is what Lacan
linked to a notion of the soul. Where in the Western tradition the
association of supreme being with God is expressed in the biblical
statement, "'I am the one who is,' by which God asserts his identity
with Being," the subject only achieves a sense of being through the
fantasy object a, the function of which is precisely to present itself
as a "semblance of being," as that which "give\[s\] us the basis of
being" (p. 95). The object a presents itself as a "remainder" (p. 6), a
remnant of the lost being, grounding itself as the source of the "soul"
that links us to God (p. 84). In this manner, we may read race as a form
of what Lacan called "soul loving," whereby individuals of the same race
"love each other as the same in the Other," love each other as a
mirrored self that contains the very same object the subject is in
pursuit of, the object belonging to the self but absent from the self
(p. 85). [This object, as a missing remnant of the self found in the
other of the same race, constitutes, I suggest, a fundamental
essentialism inherent in race. At root, it is the notion of an essential
fantasy sameness, an illusory core-self identifiable in the other of the
same race, that binds the subject to his or her racial partner as
complement. Such sameness, sought in the other, is rooted in what Lacan
called the extimacy of the self, the self's constitution by the
"extremity of \[an\] intimacy that is at the same time excluded
internally" (2013, p. 16).2 This internal exclusion of the subject is
what is most fully embodied by the unconscious as an intimate but
external agency structured by the signifiers of the Symbolic. It is thus
the extimate unconscious that we must first isolate in our understanding
of the psychic functions of race.]{.underline}

#### Attempting to use race as a form of identity formation, binds the racial subject to an unattainable object a. The affirmatives move towards political formation around identity politics only reproduces the same structures they attempt to combat.

[Most important in this traversal of race is an essential recognition of
the lack in the signifiers of the Other, a recognition that the
signifier does not capture the subject's entire being. Especially
apparent in signifiers of race -- like "black boy" --, there is always a
left over, a part of the self that cannot emerge fully through the
racial signifiers' subjective meanings. It is this very failure of the
signifier that is highlighted in Figure 1, wherein the circle of being
designates an entire portion of the split subject that exists in the
Real and is only partially accessible through the
unconscious.]{.underline} The first implication of the fact that being
is elided by the signifier's meaning is that, as we have seen, the
subject is thus petrified into a signifier and simultaneously alienated
from that part of the self that can be, but is not, signified by
language, that part situated in the unconscious, where being and
signification overlap to create non-meaning. But more radical than this
is the implication that there is a part of the subject that is not
available to the operations of the signifier but yet may express itself
through desire, the part that comprises the rest of the circle of being.
As Lacan argued, desire is "the metonymy of our being," and the "channel
in which desire is located is not simply that of the modulation of the
signifying chain" (1997, p. 321). This desire, I suggest, is what can
facilitate an ethical separation of the S1 and S2, creating critical
distance from the signifier and opening up a space for the subject to
access better that of the self which escapes the signifier. If we return
to Fanon's Jean Veneuse, what we see is exactly a desire for abandonment
that escapes signification and indeed grants structure to the signifiers
that define subjectivity, organizing them by their effort to repress
this desire. The escape of desire from the signifier is possible because
the Lacanian subject is not merely the subject of the signifier, who
"appears in the field of the Other," but also "the subject in the field
of the drive," (1998b, p. 199), where desire functions as that which is
"agitated in the drive" (p. 243). Characterized by a "constant force," a
tension that is at odds with the homeostasis and delayed gratification
promised by the signifier (p. 164), the drive is "different from any
stimulation coming from the outside world" because it is an "internal"
force (p. 164). It emerges from the libido as "pure life instinct,"
"irrepressible" and "indestructible life" (p. 198). This libido,
manifesting itself most appropriately as that which "the sexed being
loses in sexuality" (p. 197), is connected to Freud's notion of the
subject as initially "polymorphous, aberrant," able to attain pleasure
from all sources, but as subsequently forced to localize pleasure in the
erogenous zones (p. 176). The signifier and the mores of the Symbolic
institute a homeostasis that restricts "sexuality," as a manifestation
of the force of the libido, into coming "into play only in the form of
partial drives" (p. 176), so that we "deal only with that part of
sexuality that passes" into "the networks of the signifier" (p. 177);
but the force of this immortal libido insistently marks its presence at
the site of the "gaps that the distribution of the signifying
investments sets up in the subject" (p. 180). We see this insistence,
for example, in parapraxis, as something slips through the network of
the signifier, something emerging from the "losage ◊," from the
unconscious as a gap that Lacan places "at the centre of any relation"
between "reality and the subject" (p. 181). It is because the force of
what emerges from the unconscious in this movement outward directs the
subject to the Other that the drive holds particular importance to an
understanding of race. What race encourages through the Other is
substitution of desire for the drive, as it petrifies the subject in a
stagnant relation to the fantasy object. The movement of the drive
involves a "circular" path out from the gaps of subjectivity toward the
Other and back to the subject (1998b, p. 178). In the place of the
Other, the drive encounters and closes in on "the petit a," which is "in
fact simply the presence of a hollow, a void" that "can be occupied by
any object" but that functions as representative of the "lost object"
(p. 180). [In the American Symbolic, I contend, the object a of race,
acquired from the Other, binds the racial subject to this circular path
around a hollow that serves as the source of identity. Unlike the path
of desire, which involves a continual metonymic movement from object to
object in search of a source of satisfaction, the drive endlessly
circles its illusive object, "attaining its satisfaction without
attaining its aim"]{.underline} (p. 179). [While failing to attain the
racial identity represented by the object a of race, the subject of race
yet still remains bound to the a because the a of race becomes integral
to the drive's function not just of "making oneself seen," but more
fundamentally of "making oneself"]{.underline} (p. 195). [In
encountering the object a defined by the Other, the subject acquires in
this object, in race, a "little mirror," an "illusion" of self, to which
the subject may "accommodate his own image"]{.underline} (p. 159). [We
can say that in race the subject "assumes the role of the object,"
embracing the reversal whereby it is the jouissance and demands of the
Other that are privileged]{.underline} (p. 185). [But this static
objectification stifles the metonymy of desire. The fantasy object
petrifying the self becomes the master signifier through which a
"primal" repression of being is achieved, and what is "built on" the
signifier, as we saw with Vaneuse, is "the symptom" of the subject,
"constituted" as a "scaffolding of signifiers"]{.underline} (1998b, p.
176). [It is because of the satisfaction gained from the symptom, the
jouissance and sense of being granted by race as the soul or remnant of
a lost being, that the drive need not reach its aim of hitting the mark
set by race as object a. This satisfaction is sustained as the source of
a subjective self with "nothing else" ensuring its "consistency except
the object, as something that must be circumvented," something both
aimed at and missed]{.underline} (p. 181). Lacan tied the pleasure of
the symptom upheld by the drive to a kind of autoeroticism that he
described in the image of "a mouth sewn up" in "certain silences,"
closed "upon its own satisfaction" (p. 179). [It is this closing up upon
a jouissance of pain and pleasure, this insertion into the self of the
Other's signifier, that I associate with race. However, Lacanian theory
also shows that "by snatching at its object, the drive learns in a sense
that this is precisely not the way it will be satisfied"]{.underline}
(1998b, p. 167). [I suggest that the existing ambivalence about race of
both African Americans and white Americans makes possible increased
recognition that race does not produce the sovereign humanness or
supreme satisfaction that binds subjects to race as a fantasy source of
being. Though the extent to which recent events in America mark a
permanent shift in relations to the signifiers of race is yet to be
seen, whiteness itself and the very value of race have been cynically
questioned in the wake of publicized incidents of "white"-on-"black"
murders -- like the shootings of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, and
Jordan Davis by Michael Dunn -- and police-on- "black" killings, like
the death of Eric Garner in an illegal chokehold by New York police who
alleged he was unlawfully selling cigarettes.5]{.underline} In light of
active protests in Missouri after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by
police in the streets of Ferguson, some have even argued optimistically
that we are bearing witness to a "new civil rights movement which has
sprung up" (Ifill, 2014). Whether or not this movement comes to full
fruition, it is precisely a process of bearing witness that is key to
its development thus far. [What I suggest has occurred in the immediate
aftermath of the killing of these black men is a shift in many
Americans' scopic relation to the Other. At issue in this shift is the
gaze of the Other, which Lacan stated "has the effect of arresting
movement" and halting transgression]{.underline} (1998b, p. 118). [What
objectifies the subject, as the movement of his or her drive binds the
subject to the jouissance of the a, is subjection to an "entirely hidden
gaze" of the Other, which the subject positions as a policing authority
for whom the subject performs his or her identity]{.underline} (p. 182).
[This disembodied observer and judge constitutes an extimacy that
polices unconscious desires, ensuring that "it is in the space of the
Other that \[the subject\] sees himself and the point from which he
looks at himself is also in that space" (p. 144). This space of the
"capital Other," Lacan said, is the "locus of speech," the Symbolic (p.
129). Where Lacan associated this locus with the law, the law of the
father and the law of desire, it can be said that this hidden gaze is
often given presence by the police. Embodying the arresting gaze that
"surprises" the subject in his moment of transgression, the police
should allow to arise "the conflagration of shame" that realigns the
subject's desire away from the pathological object of his or her
fixation (p. 182).]{.underline} [But while the police of Ferguson have
facilitated an ostensive realignment of America's subjective relation to
the object of race, they have done so by also largely dispossessing
themselves of the agency of the shaming gaze.]{.underline}

#### George indicts butler's thesis of political planning. Butler's poststructuralism fails because understanding race as a performance, forecloses the opportunity to question deeper drives.

**George 2014** (George, Sheldon. Psychoanal Cult Soc (2014) 19: 360.
<https://doi.org/10.1057/pcs.2014.36>. DOA)

[Though the ethical responsibility of issuing this challenge to the
concept of race is ceded through the glorification of the a, this
responsibility is established even in the model of poststructuralism
that holds such sway over contempor- ary thinking about social change,
wherein the ultimate aim of the theory is not an essentialist but a
strategic deployment of identity. In the poststructuralist vision,
because the given identity is "never fully owned," it remains open to
"urgent and expanding political purposes" that demand shifting
allegiances across such lines as race, class and gender]{.underline}
(Butler, 1993, p. 228). [But while poststructuralism produces this
politics driven by a metonymic shift in subjective positionality by
assuming a center-less self untethered from all identity, I envision
through psychoanalysis the subject's encounter with an excluded center
masked by the illusions of this subject's embraced
identities.]{.underline} [Where belief in race threatens to bind the
subject to the fantasies of wholeness secured by the object a, and where
true poststructuralist resignification of race forecloses recognition of
the deeper drives that guide the identity politics of the individual
subject, such a potentially seminal moment in the reconfiguration of
race offers the racialized subject a unique opportunity to attempt a
Lacanian traversal of race that can ground individual political activity
in deeper recognition of the subject's desire]{.underline}. Lacan
specified that the object a "plays the role of obturator," inhibiting
such recognition by facilitating the "closing of the unconscious"
(1998b, p. 144). [Aimed at an impossible wholeness, what the object a of
race attempts is to fill the constitutive gaps in the subject, the
spaces left unoccupied by the subject's absent being. But Lacanian
theory stipulates that the "subject who has traversed the radical
fantasy \[can\] experience the drive" that exudes from the space of
these gaps]{.underline} (p. 273[). Where this drive is an expression of
the undirected libido whose "effective presence" is registered only in
"desire," it is through the process of reorienting one's desire away
from such fantasies as race that the subject may begin the process of
experiencing and directing this internal tension of the
drive]{.underline} (p. 153). [Through the process of "mapping" one's own
desire in one's cynical questioning of the object a presented by the
Other]{.underline} (p. 273), [the subject is placed upon the "track of
something that is specifically \[her\] business," situating herself in
relation to a desire and drive that is particularly her own
belonging]{.underline} (1997, p. 319[). It is perhaps most likely that
the recent attention to repeated incidents of deadly violence to black
men will not produce sustained social skepticism about the value of
race, for "the loop" of the fundamental fantasy, Lacan stressed, "must
be run through several times" if the subject is to free himself truly
from the illusions of the Other. However, the unconscious gap opened up
by this cynical response to race at the national level allows essential
space for the initial movements of the individual subject of race along
the path of this loop.]{.underline}

## Impacts

### Zero solvency

#### The aff sexualizes the impact while different partial drives continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity---the plan never really solves because it is infinitely regressive 

**Zupančič 8** \[Alenka. Why Psychoanalysis?: Three Interventions. NSU
Press, 2008. p. 7-11\] KA

[Freud starts with the discussion of 'sexual aberrations' that were
identified as such in the existing corpus of medical knowledge:
homosexuality, sodomy, paedophilia, fetishism, voyeurism, sadism,
masochism, and so on. In discussing these 'perversions' and the
mechanisms involved in them (basically the deviations in respect of the
sexual object, which is supposed to be an adult person of the opposite
sex, and deviations in respect of the sexual aim -- supposedly
reproduction) Freud's argument simultaneously moves in two directions.
On the one hand, he extensively demonstrates how the 'aberrant'
mechanisms involved in these practices are very much present in what is
considered to be 'normal' or 'natural' sexual behaviour. Insofar as they
well integrated in what is considered to be 'normal' sexuality, they are
not viewed as perversions. They are only considered as perverse
aberrations if they become altogether independent of the 'appropriate'
sexual object and of the supposed sexual aim, if they become autonomous
in their fragmented, partial aims that serve no meaningful purpose.
Freud would object, however, to the word 'become' -- and this
constitutes the second, crucial line of his argument. Drives are
fragmented, partial, aimless and independent of their object to start
with]{.underline}. They do not become such due to some ulterior
deviation. The deviation of drives is a constitutive deviation. Freud
writes that "[the sexual drive is in the first instance independent of
its object; nor is its origin likely to be dues to its object's
attraction]{.underline}s." 2 This is why "from the point of view of
psychoanalysis, the exclusive sexual interest felt by men for women is
also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a self-evident fact
based upon an attraction that is ultimately of a chemical nature." 3 The
discovery of this constitutive and original deviation of drives (which
is precisely what distinguishes them from instincts) will gradually lead
to one of the major conceptual inventions of psychoanalysis, the concept
of [the object small a]{.underline} (objet petit a), as it was named by
Lacan. To put it simply, object a [will come to name the]{.underline}
other (the [real]{.underline}) [object of the drive as "independent of
its object]{.underline}." But let us look at the origin of this concept
in Freud's observations. One of Freud's main examples is thumb-sucking,
which he analyses as a manifestation of infantile sexuality (the
existence of which was, for the first time, systematically pointed out
by Freud, and which has met with strong resistance). In relation to the
need for nourishment, to which it attaches itself at the outset, the
oral drive pursues an object different from food: it pursues (and aims
at repeating) the very sensation of satisfaction produced in the region
of the mouth during the act of nutrition. Oral satisfaction, which arose
as a byproduct of the satisfying of the need for food, starts to
function as an autonomous object of the drive, it moves away from its
first object and lets itself be led into series of substitute objects.
In other words, [the concept of the drive]{.underline} (and of its
object) [is not simply a concept of the deviation from a natural
need,]{.underline} but something that casts a new and surprising light
on the nature of human need as such: [in human beings, all satisfaction
of a need allows, in principle, for another satisfaction to
occur]{.underline}, [which tends to become independent and
self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself]{.underline}.
[There is no natural need that would be]{.underline} absolutely pure,
i.e. [devoid of this surplus element which splits it from
within]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} split, this interval or void,
this original [non-convergence of two different versant of the
satisfaction is]{.underline}, for Freud, [the very site of ground of
human sexuality]{.underline}. This is a crucial point when it comes to
understanding another important emphasis of Freud's conceptualization of
sexuality: '[sexual' is not to be confused with 'genital']{.underline}.
4 The 'genital sexual organization' is far from being primordial or
'natural': it is a result, a product of several stages of development,
involving both the physiological maturation of the reproductive organs
and cultural-symbolic parameters. It involves a unification of the
originally heterogeneous, dispersed, always-already compound sexual
drive, composed of different partial drives, such as looking, touching,
licking, and so on. ("Since the original disposition is necessarily a
complex one, the sexual drive itself must be something put together from
various factors." 5). The unification bears two major characteristics.
Firstly, [it is always a somehow force and artificial
unification]{.underline} ([it cannot be viewed simply as a natural
teleological result of reproductive maturations]{.underline}).
[And]{.underline} secondly, [it is never really fully achieved or
accomplished]{.underline}, which is to say that [it never transforms the
sexual drive into an organic Unity]{.underline}, [with all its
components ultimately serving one and the same Purpose]{.underline}. The
'normal,' 'healthy' [human sexuality is thus paradoxical artificial
naturalization of the originally de-naturalised drives]{.underline}
(de-naturalized in the sense of their departing from the 'natural' aims
of self-preservation and/or the logic of a pure need as unaffected by
another, supplementary satisfaction). One could even say that [human
sexuality is 'sexual']{.underline} (and not simply 'reproduction ')
[precisely insofar as the unification at stake]{.underline}, [the tying
of all the drives to one single Purpose, never really works, but allow
for different partial drives to continue their circular,
self-perpetuating activity]{.underline}. Freud introduced the concept of
libido to refer to the quantum of energy at work in the specific,
'declinational' path of the drives, libido names the 'energy' involved
in the processes of supplementary satisfaction, for instance -- to
pursue the previous example -- thumb-sucking, or consuming food beyond
the biological needs of the body, for the sheer pleasure of exciting the
mucous membrane. Freud insists that this energy/excitation is sexual,
although "this sexual excitation is derived not from the so-called
sexual parts alone, but from all the bodily organs." 6 This point is
absolutely crucial, for it allows us to see in what sense Freud actually
discovered (human) sexuality, and not simply emphasize it or 'reduced'
everything to it. It is not that thumb-sucking or gourmandising are
sexual against the background of their supposed relationship to the
excitation involved in sexual intercourse, on the contrary, if anything,
they are sexual per se, and it is sexual intercourse which is properly
sexual on account of being composed of different partial drives such as
these (looking, touching, licking, and so on). It is in relation to this
Freudian stance that one can measure the significance of the stakes
involved in his break with Carl Gustav Jung, as well as the genuine
philosophical implications of Freud's radical conceptual move, Jung
adopted the Freudian notion of the libido and, with a seemingly small
modification, gave it an entirely different meaning, with Jung, libido
becomes a psychical expression of a 'vital energy,' the origin of which
is not solely sexual. In this perspective, libido is a general name for
psychic energy, which is sexual only in certain segments. Freud
immediately saw how following this Jungian move would entail sacrificing
"all that we have gained hitherto from psychoanalytic observation." 7
With the term 'libido' Freud designates an original and irreducible
unbalance of human nature. Every satisfaction of a need brings with it
the possibility of a supplementary satisfaction, deviating from the
object and aim of a given demand while pursuing its own goal, thus
constituting a seemingly dysfunctional detour. It is this detour, or the
space which it opens up, that constitutes not only the field of the
catalogued 'sexual aberrations,'; but also the ground, as well as the
energy source, for what is generally referred to as human culture in its
highest accomplishments. The generative source of culture is sexual in
this precise sense of belonging to the supplementary satisfaction that
serves no immediate function and satisfies no immediate need. The image
of human nature that follows from these Freudian conceptualisations is
that of a split (and conflictual) nature, whereby 'sexual' refers to
this very split. If Freud uses the term '[libido']{.underline} to refer
to a certain field of 'energy,' it is to refer to it as a surplus
energy, and not to any kind of general energetic level involved in our
lives. It [cannot designate the whole of energy]{.underline} (as Jung
suggested), [since it is precisely what makes this whole
'not-whole.']{.underline} [Sexual 'energy' is not an element that has
its place within the whole of human life]{.underline}; the central point
of Freud's discovery was precisely that [there is no 'natural' or
pre-established place of human sexuality]{.underline},
[that]{.underline} the latter [is constitutively out-of-its-place,
fragmented and dispersed,]{.underline} that [it only exists in
deviations from 'itself' or its supposed natural object, and that
sexuality is nothing other than this 'out-of-placeness' of its
constitutive satisfaction]{.underline}. In other words, Freud's
fundamental move was to de-substantialise sexuality: [the sexual is not
a substance to be properly described and circumscribed; it is the very
impossibility of its own circumscription or delimitation]{.underline}.
It can neither be completely separated from biological, organic needs
and functions (since it originates within their realm, it starts off by
inhabiting them), nor can it be simple reduced to them. [Sexual is not a
separate domain of human activity or life, and this why it can inhabit
all the domains of human life.]{.underline} [What]{.underline} was, and
still [is, disturbing about the Freudian discovery is]{.underline} not
simple the emphasis on sexuality -- this kind of resistance, indignant
at psychoanalytical 'obsession with dirty matters,' was never the
strongest one and was soon marginalized by the progressive liberalism of
morals. Much more disturbing was [the]{.underline} thesis concerning the
always problematic and uncertain character of sexuality itself. Thus,
even more [powerful resistance]{.underline} (and the more dangerous form
of revisionism) ca[me from liberalism itself, promoting sexuality as a
'natural activity,' as something balanced, harmonic in itself, but
thrown out of balance by an act of 'necessary' or 'unnecessary'
repression]{.underline} (depending on how liberal on pretends to be). If
anything, this image of sexuality as something obvious and
non-problematic in itself is directly opposed to the Freudian
fundamental lesson which, put in Lacanian terms, could be formulated as
follows: the Sexual does not exist. There is only the sexual that
insist/persists as a constitutive imbalance of the human being. Let me
rest my case with one last quote from Freud: "It is my belief that,
however strange it may sound, [we must reckon with the possibility that
something in the nature of the sexual drive itself is unfavourable to
the realization of complete satisfaction]{.underline}." 8

### Infinite cycle of need

#### The aff sexualizes the impact while different partial drives continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity---the plan never really solves because it is infinitely regressive 

**Zupančič 8** \[Alenka. Why Psychoanalysis?: Three Interventions. NSU
Press, 2008. p. 7-11\] KA

[Freud starts with the discussion of 'sexual aberrations' that were
identified as such in the existing corpus of medical knowledge:
homosexuality, sodomy, paedophilia, fetishism, voyeurism, sadism,
masochism, and so on. In discussing these 'perversions' and the
mechanisms involved in them (basically the deviations in respect of the
sexual object, which is supposed to be an adult person of the opposite
sex, and deviations in respect of the sexual aim -- supposedly
reproduction) Freud's argument simultaneously moves in two directions.
On the one hand, he extensively demonstrates how the 'aberrant'
mechanisms involved in these practices are very much present in what is
considered to be 'normal' or 'natural' sexual behaviour. Insofar as they
well integrated in what is considered to be 'normal' sexuality, they are
not viewed as perversions. They are only considered as perverse
aberrations if they become altogether independent of the 'appropriate'
sexual object and of the supposed sexual aim, if they become autonomous
in their fragmented, partial aims that serve no meaningful purpose.
Freud would object, however, to the word 'become' -- and this
constitutes the second, crucial line of his argument. Drives are
fragmented, partial, aimless and independent of their object to start
with]{.underline}. They do not become such due to some ulterior
deviation. The deviation of drives is a constitutive deviation. Freud
writes that "[the sexual drive is in the first instance independent of
its object; nor is its origin likely to be dues to its object's
attraction]{.underline}s." 2 This is why "from the point of view of
psychoanalysis, the exclusive sexual interest felt by men for women is
also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a self-evident fact
based upon an attraction that is ultimately of a chemical nature." 3 The
discovery of this constitutive and original deviation of drives (which
is precisely what distinguishes them from instincts) will gradually lead
to one of the major conceptual inventions of psychoanalysis, the concept
of [the object small a]{.underline} (objet petit a), as it was named by
Lacan. To put it simply, object a [will come to name the]{.underline}
other (the [real]{.underline}) [object of the drive as "independent of
its object]{.underline}." But let us look at the origin of this concept
in Freud's observations. One of Freud's main examples is thumb-sucking,
which he analyses as a manifestation of infantile sexuality (the
existence of which was, for the first time, systematically pointed out
by Freud, and which has met with strong resistance). In relation to the
need for nourishment, to which it attaches itself at the outset, the
oral drive pursues an object different from food: it pursues (and aims
at repeating) the very sensation of satisfaction produced in the region
of the mouth during the act of nutrition. Oral satisfaction, which arose
as a byproduct of the satisfying of the need for food, starts to
function as an autonomous object of the drive, it moves away from its
first object and lets itself be led into series of substitute objects.
In other words, [the concept of the drive]{.underline} (and of its
object) [is not simply a concept of the deviation from a natural
need,]{.underline} but something that casts a new and surprising light
on the nature of human need as such: [in human beings, all satisfaction
of a need allows, in principle, for another satisfaction to
occur]{.underline}, [which tends to become independent and
self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself]{.underline}.
[There is no natural need that would be]{.underline} absolutely pure,
i.e. [devoid of this surplus element which splits it from
within]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} split, this interval or void,
this original [non-convergence of two different versant of the
satisfaction is]{.underline}, for Freud, [the very site of ground of
human sexuality]{.underline}. This is a crucial point when it comes to
understanding another important emphasis of Freud's conceptualization of
sexuality: '[sexual' is not to be confused with 'genital']{.underline}.
4 The 'genital sexual organization' is far from being primordial or
'natural': it is a result, a product of several stages of development,
involving both the physiological maturation of the reproductive organs
and cultural-symbolic parameters. It involves a unification of the
originally heterogeneous, dispersed, always-already compound sexual
drive, composed of different partial drives, such as looking, touching,
licking, and so on. ("Since the original disposition is necessarily a
complex one, the sexual drive itself must be something put together from
various factors." 5). The unification bears two major characteristics.
Firstly, [it is always a somehow force and artificial
unification]{.underline} ([it cannot be viewed simply as a natural
teleological result of reproductive maturations]{.underline}).
[And]{.underline} secondly, [it is never really fully achieved or
accomplished]{.underline}, which is to say that [it never transforms the
sexual drive into an organic Unity]{.underline}, [with all its
components ultimately serving one and the same Purpose]{.underline}. The
'normal,' 'healthy' [human sexuality is thus paradoxical artificial
naturalization of the originally de-naturalised drives]{.underline}
(de-naturalized in the sense of their departing from the 'natural' aims
of self-preservation and/or the logic of a pure need as unaffected by
another, supplementary satisfaction). One could even say that [human
sexuality is 'sexual']{.underline} (and not simply 'reproduction ')
[precisely insofar as the unification at stake]{.underline}, [the tying
of all the drives to one single Purpose, never really works, but allow
for different partial drives to continue their circular,
self-perpetuating activity]{.underline}. Freud introduced the concept of
libido to refer to the quantum of energy at work in the specific,
'declinational' path of the drives, libido names the 'energy' involved
in the processes of supplementary satisfaction, for instance -- to
pursue the previous example -- thumb-sucking, or consuming food beyond
the biological needs of the body, for the sheer pleasure of exciting the
mucous membrane. Freud insists that this energy/excitation is sexual,
although "this sexual excitation is derived not from the so-called
sexual parts alone, but from all the bodily organs." 6 This point is
absolutely crucial, for it allows us to see in what sense Freud actually
discovered (human) sexuality, and not simply emphasize it or 'reduced'
everything to it. It is not that thumb-sucking or gourmandising are
sexual against the background of their supposed relationship to the
excitation involved in sexual intercourse, on the contrary, if anything,
they are sexual per se, and it is sexual intercourse which is properly
sexual on account of being composed of different partial drives such as

#### Getting swept off our feet by our fantasies ends with a harsh encounter that politics cannot be controlled by us 

**Stavrakakis 99** (Yannis Stavrakakis has PhD degrees from the
'Ideology and Discourse Analysis' programme at the University of Essex,
"Lacan and the Political", p.64, 10/3/99) JK

The field of social construction and political reality is the field in
which the symbolisation of this real is attempted. Chaitin is correct
when asserting that [symbolisation has the creative power to produce
cultural identities, but at]{.underline} a price, [the cost of covering
over the fundamental nothingness that forms its foundation it is
culture, not nature, that abhors a vacuum, above all that of its own
contingency]{.underline} (Chaitin, 1996:4- 5), [of its ultimate
inability to master and symbolise the impossible real: there is a
structural lack in the symbolic, which means that certain points of the
real canít be symbolised in a definite manner]{.underline}. **[The
unmitigated real provokes anxiety, and this in turn gives rise to
never-ending, defensive, imaginary constructs]{.underline}** (Verhaeghe,
1994:60). Following from this, [all human productions \[Society itself,
culture, religion, science can be understood in the light of that
structural failure of the symbolic in relationship to the
real]{.underline} (ibid.: 61). [It is the moment of this failure, the
moment of our encounter with the real, that is revealed as the moment of
the political par excellence]{.underline} in our reading of Lacan. [It
is the constitutivity of this moment in Lacanian psychoanalysis that
proves our fantasmatic conception of the socio-political institution of
society as a harmonious totality to be no more than a mirage. It is this
traumatic moment of the political qua encounter with the real that
initiates again and again a process of symbolisation, and initiates the
ever-present hegemonic play between different symbolisations of this
real. This play leads to the emergence of politics, to the political
institution of a new social fantasy (or of many antagonistic fantasies
engaged in a struggle for hegemony) in the place of the dislocated
one,]{.underline} and so on and so forth. In this light, Lacan's
insistence on the centrality of the real, especially in the latter part
of his teaching, acquires major political importance. Lacan himself, in
his seminar on The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis uses
noise and accident as metaphors or examples of our encounter with the
real. It might be possible to add the political to this chain of
equivalences. Lacan's schema of socio-political life is that of a play,
an unending circular play between possibility and impossibility, between
construction and destruction, representation and failure, articulation
and dislocation, reality and the real, politics and the political.

#### The 1AC as a patient should be terminable -- Yet their attempts at endless reform and endless conquest results in the repetitious cycle within academia

**Weisman 86** Avery, "Terminality and Interminable Psychoanalysis: An
Incomplete Report", https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/287923.

Having described what I consider the three major concepts that emerged
from Pro­ject Omega[[, I want to turn away now to psy­choanalysis,
especially with respect to the obscure relation that psychoanalysis in
the­ory and practice bears to the facts about death I have been
considering]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 take a very personal interest in
[[the link between psychoanalysis and thanatology, es­pecially when
considering death and dying]{.underline}]{.mark}, since for a long time,
I did psychoanalysis alongside my work in Project Omega. I wor­ried about
the overlap and carry-over of one part of my day to another[[. I was
afraid, for example, that 1 might inadvertently slant the substance of
analytic hours and urge my pa­tients to talk about death unnecessarily.
On the other hand, or in the other parts of my professional day, I was
equally concerned about inadvertently interpreting physical symptoms and
disabilities as if they were psychologically motivated, and needed just
the right formulation.]{.underline}]{.mark} Self-serving illusions that
even hallucinate data and conjure up findings are not uncom­mon in any
field where the investigator has a strong emotional stake[[. However, it
is regu­larly met within the psychological domain where investigators can
readily find what they are looking for, and construe rather du­bious data
as supporting their original hy­pothesis. If you look in only one
direction, it is hard to see anything else. No one publishes nega­tive
finding]{.underline}]{.mark}s; retractions are very rare in the
literature of science, and careers are not built by confirming the work
of others. In all candor, I refrained - perhaps too conscientiously -
from pushing ideas about death onto my analytic patients[[. Naturally. I
hoped to find confirmation of my surmises, suppositions and hypotheses
about the place of death-anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark} in the mental life
of healthy adults. Later, I did! But while listening daily to the usual
psychodynamic bells and buzzers alerting me to the approach of something
sig­nificant, I tried not to be carried away. In­stead. I dwelt in the
here-and-now, without too many eager surmises about terminality and
death phantasies just around the cor­ner. The contrast between healthy
psychoana­lytic patients and the very sick patients I saw at the hospital
could hardly be more extreme. They shared few characteristics besides
the obvious one of lying down. For the preterminal patient, time is very
limited, very alive. Concern about the future, conflict about problems
aside from the im­mediate now - all suspended. But at the other end of
the clinical spectrum, time has other significance for analytic
patients. Time goes on and on, day after day. month after month, even
year after year. **[[Concerns, conflicts and dilemmas are very much
alive; time in the sense of change is suspended. Time for a terminal
patient can run out at a moment's notice]{.underline}]{.mark}** -
almost. Drastic changes in symptoms and physical status might take place
over night. Again, in contrast, life in the analytic format tends only
to fluctuate on the vertical, not in the horizontal sense of finding
abrupt longitudinal changes. The analytic changes occur in the way that
an emotional elevator moves up and down, not like a con­tinuous train of
irreversible events. My point is this[[. Terminal patients can die
almost any time; time is tangible. For both analytic patients and the
analyst, time is not only suspended, but the atmosphere is such that
gradually both feel exempt from the pressures, circumstances, events,
and even forces of outside life. Analysis constitutes a timeless
universe of its own.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although many people -
analysts and ana­lytic patients might refuse to admit that this is the
case - time and the outside world are insidiously excluded. It becomes
very easy, and then easier still, to conjure up a kind of never-never
land where conflicts are old, yet still fresh today. People never age;
all deci­sions can be postponed, and conveniently relegated to the
'perhaps', 'we'll see', and 'let's examine how it is that you feel that
way'. Everything exists as it always has, ex­cept in a diluted form.
Traces of early life persist, phantasies shift, fold, and repeat with
almost undiminished regularity. **[[The stream of consciousness never
empties into the sea; the journey goes on, endlessly. All this
encourages a delusion of immor­tality in which all participants are
implicitly exempted from the processes and pressures of aging, illness,
accident, and death]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### The negative's analysis cannot be commodified as the analysis done by the 1NC is represented by its *use* rather than its *exchange value*

Interminable." *Yale French Studies*, no. 63, 1982, pp. 21--44. *JSTOR*,

[[Teaching, thus, is not the transmission of ready-made knowledge, it is
rather the creation of a new condition of knowledge-the creation of an
original learning-disposition]{.underline}]{.mark}. \"What I teach
you\", says Lacan, \"does nothing other than express the condition
thanks to which what Freud says is possible\" (S-Il, 368). [[The lesson,
then, does not \"teach]{.underline}]{.mark}\" Freud: [[it teaches the
\"condition\" which make it possible to learn]{.underline}]{.mark}
Freud-the condition which makes possible Freud\'s teaching. What is this
condition? [[In analysis, what sets in motion the psychoanalytical
apprenticeship is the peculiar pedagogical structure of the analytic
situation. The analysis speaks to the analyst, whom he endows with the
authority of the one who possesses knowledge-knowledge of what is
precisely lacking in the analysis' own knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The analyst, however, knows nothing of the sort. His only competence,
insists Lacan, lies in \"what I would call textual knowledge, so as to
oppose it to the referential notion which only masks it\" (Scilicet I,
21). Textual knowledge-the very stuff the literature teacher is supposed
to deal in-is knowledge of the functioning of language, of symbolic
structures, of the signifier, knowledge at once derived from-and
directed towards-interpreta- tion. B[[ut such knowledge cannot be
acquired (or possessed) once and for all: each case, each text, has its
own specific, singular symbolic functioning, and requires thus a
different-an original-interpretation. The analysts, says Lacan, are
\"those who share this knowledge only at the price, on the condition of
their not being able to exchange it\"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Scilicet I,
59). **[[Analytic (textual) knowledge cannot be exchanged, it has to be
used-and used in each case differently, according to the singularity of
the case, according to the specificity of the text. Textual (or
analytic) knowledge is, in other words, that peculiarly specific
knowledge which, unlike any commodity, is subsumed by its use value,
having no exchange value whatsoever\"s]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Analysis has thus no use for ready-made interpretations, for knowledge
given in advance.]{.underline}]{.mark} Lacan insists on \"the insistence
with which Freud recommends to us to approach each new case as if we had
never learnt anything from his first interpretations\" (Scilicet, I,
20). \"What the analyst must know,\" concludes Lacan, \"is how to ignore
what he knows.\" Each case is thus, for the analyst as well as for the
patient, a new apprentice- ship. \"If it\'s true that our knowledge
comes to the rescue of the patient\'s ignorance, it is not less true
that, for our part, we, too, are plunged in ignorance\" (S-I, 78). While
the analysand is obviously ignorant of his own unconscious, the analyst
is doubly ignorant: pedagogically ignorant of his suspended (given)
knowledge; actually ignorant of the very knowledge the analysand
presumes him to possess of his own (the analysand\'s) unconscious:
knowledge of the very knowledge he-the patient-lacks. In what way does
knowledge, then, emerge in and from the analytic situation? Through the
analytic dialogue the analyst, indeed, has first to learn where to
situate the ignorance: where his own textual knowledge is resisted. It
is, however, out of this resistance, out of the patient\'s active
ignorance, out of the patient\'s speech which says much more than it
itself knows, that the analyst will come to learn the patient\'s own
unconscious knowledge, that knowledge which is inaccessible to itself
because it cannot tolerate knowing that it knows; and it is the
signifiers of this constitutively a-reflexive knowledge coming from the
patient that the analyst returns to the patient from his different
vantage point, from his non-reflexive, asymmetrical position as an
Other. Contrary to the traditional pedagogical dynamic, in which the
teacher\'s question is addressed to an answer from the other-from the
student-which is totally reflexive, and expected, \"the true Other\"
says Lacan, \"is the Other who gives the answer one does not expect\"
(S-II, 288). Coming from the Other, knowledge is, by definition, that
which comes as a surprise, that which is constitutively the return of a
difference:

#### The 1AC as a patient attempts to teach their knowledge in an interminable standpoint -- This results in the 1AC subverting the violence described back onto itself 

[[Nowhere else does Freud describe as keenly the revolutionary
radicalit]{.underline}]{.mark}y of the very nature of the teaching to be
(practically and theoretically) [[derived from the originality of the
psychoanalytical experience.]{.underline}]{.mark} The analysand is
qualified to be an analyst as of the point at which he understands his
own analysis to be inherently unfinished, incomplete, as of the point,
that is, at which he settles into his own didactic analysis-or his own
analytical apprenticeship-as fundamentally interminable. It is, in other
words, as of the moment the student recognizes that learning has no
term, that he can himself become a teacher, assume the position of the
teacher[[. But the position of the teacher is itself the position of the
one who learns, of the one who teaches nothing other than the way he
learns. The subject of teaching is interminably-a student; the subject
of teaching is interminably-a learning.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is the
most radical, perhaps the most far-reaching insight psychoanalysis can
give us into peda- gogy. Freud pushes this original understanding of
what pedagogy is to its logical limit. Speaking of the \"defensive\"
tendency of psychoanalysts \"to divert the implications and demands of
analysis from themselves (probably by directing them on to other
people)\"-of the analysts\' tendency, that is, \"to withdraw from the
critical and corrective influence of analysis,\" as well as of the
temptation of power threatening them in the very exercise of their
profession, Freud enjoins: [[Every analyst should periodically-at
intervals of five years or so-submit himself to analysis once more,
without feeling ashamed of taking this step.]{.underline}]{.mark} This
would mean, then, that not only the therapeutic analysis of patients\'
but his own analysis would change from a terminable into an interminable
task. \[Standard, XXIII, 249\] 17. [[The therapeutic analysis of
patients is \"interminable\" to the extent that repression can never be
totally lifted, only displaced.]{.underline}]{.mark} Cf. Freud\'s letter
to Fliess, dated April 16, 1900: \" \'E\'s career as a patient has at
last come to an end . .. His riddle is almost completely solved, his
condition is excellent \... At the moment a residue of his symptoms
remains. I am beginning to understand that the apparently interminable
nature of the treatment is something determined by law and is dependent
on the transference.\" Hence, Freud speaks of \"the asymptotic
termination of treatment.\" (Standard, XXIII, 215) Freud\'s italic. [[Of
all Freud\'s followers, Lacan alone has picked up on the radicality of
Freud\'s pedagogical concern with didactic psychoanalysis, not just as a
subsidiary technical, pragmatic question]{.underline}]{.mark} (how
should analysts be trained?), [[but as a major theoretical concern, as a
major pedagogical investigation crucial to the very innovation, to the
very revolutionary core of psychoanalytic insight. The highly peculiar
and surprising style of Lacan\'s own teaching-prac- tice is, indeed, an
answer to, a follow-up on, Freud\'s ultimate suggestion-in Lacan\'s
words-\"to make psychoanalysis and education (training) collapse into
each other\"]{.underline}]{.mark} (E 459). This is the thrust of
Lacan\'s original endeavor both as psychoanalyst and as teacher: \"in
the field of psychoanalysis,\" he writes, \"what is necessary is the
restoration of the identical status of didactic psychoanalysis and of
the teaching of psychoanalysis, in their common scientific opening\" (E
236). As a result of this conception, Lacan considers not just the
practical analyses which he-as analyst-directs, but his own public
teaching, his own seminar-primarily directed towards the
(psychoanalytical) training of ana- lysts-as partaking of didactic
psychoanalysis, as itself, thus, analytically didactic and didactically
analytical, in a new and radical way. \"How can what psychoanalysis
teaches us be taught?\" (E 439)-[[Only by continuing, in one\'s own
teaching, one\'s own interminable didactic analysis. Lacan has willingly
transformed himself into the analysand of his Seminar\'8 so as to teach,
precisely, psychoanalysis as teaching, and teaching as psycho-
analysis.]{.underline}]{.mark} Psychoanalysis as teaching, and teaching
as psychoanalysis, radically subvert the demarcation-line, the clear-cut
opposition between the analyst and the analysand, between the teacher
and the student (or the learner)- showing that what counts, in both
cases, is precisely the transition, the struggle-filled passage from one
position to the other. But the passage is itself interminable; it can
never be crossed once and for all: \"The psychoanalytic act has but to
falter slightly, and it is the analyst who becomes the analysand\"
(Scilicet I, 47). Lacan denounces, thus, \"the reactionary principle\"
of the professional belief in \"the duality of the one who suffers and
the one who cures,\" in \"the opposition between the one who knows and
the one who does not know.. . . The most corrupting of comforts is
intellectual comfort, just as one\'s worst corruption is the belief that
one is better\" (E 403[). [Lacan\'s well-known polemical and
controversial stance-his critique of psychoanalysis-itself partakes,
then, of his understanding of the pedagogical imperative of didactic
psychoanalysis. Lacan\'s original endeavor is to submit the whole
discipline of psychoanalysis to what Freud called \"the critical and
corrective influence of analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Standard,
XXIII, 249). [**Lacan, in other words, is the first to understand that
the psychoanalytic discipline is an unprece- dented one in that its
teaching does not just reflect upon itself, but turns back upon itself
so as to subvert itself, and truly teaches only insofar as it subverts
itself**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Psychoanalytic teaching is pedagogically
unique in that it is inherently, interminably, self-critical. Lacan\'s
amazing pedagogical performance thus sets forth the unparalleled example
of a teaching whose fecundity is tied up, paradoxically enough, with the
inexhaustibility-the interminability-of its self-critical potential.

### Scapegoating

#### The repression of the death drive creates a politics of utopia sustained by the scapegoating of communities that do not fall into the boundaries of their harmonious world, incarceration, and genocide.

**Stavrakakis 99** (Yannis Stavrakakis has PhD degrees from the
'Ideology and Discourse Analysis' programme at the University of Essex,
"Lacan and the Political", p.86-88, 10/3/99) JK

**[Our age is clearly an age of social fragmentation, political
disenchantment and open cynicism characterised by the decline of the
political mutations of modern universalism that, by replacing God with
Reason, reoccupied the ground of a pre-modern aspiration to fully
represent and master the essence and the totality of the real. On the
political level this universalist fantasy took the form of a series of
utopian constructions of a reconciled future society.]{.underline}** The
fragmentation of our present social terrain and cultural milieu entails
the collapse of such grandiose fantasies. 1 Today, talk about utopia is
usually characterised by a certain ambiguity. For some, of course,
utopian constructions are still seen as positive results of human
creativity in the socio-political sphere: utopia is the expression of a
desire for a better way of being (Levitas, 1990:8). Other, more
suspicious views, such as the one expressed in Marie Berneriís book
Journey through Utopia, warn of taking into account experiences like the
Second World War of the dangers entailed in trusting the idea of a
perfect, ordered and regimented world. For some, instead of being how
can we realise our utopias? í, the crucial question has become how can
we prevent their final realisation?. \[How can\] we return to a
non-utopian society, less perfect and more free (Berdiaev in Berneri,
1971:309). 2 **[It is particularly the political experience of these
last decades that led to the dislocation of utopian sensibilities and
brought to the fore a novel appreciation of human finitude, together
with a growing suspicion of all grandiose political projects and the
meta-narratives traditionally associated with them]{.underline}**
(Whitebook, 1995:75). **[All these developments, that is to say the
crisis of the utopian imaginary]{.underline}**, seem however to **[leave
politics without its prime motivating force: the politics of today is a
politics of aporia.]{.underline}** In our current political terrain,
hope seems to be replaced by pessimism or even resignation. This is a
result of the crisis in the dominant modality of our political
imagination (meaning utopianism in its various forms) and of our
inability to resolve this crisis in a productive way. 3 In this chapter,
I will try to show that Lacanian theory provides new angles through
which we can reflect on our historical experience of utopia and reorient
our political imagination beyond its suffocating strait-jacket. Letís
start our exploration with the most elementary of questions: what is the
meaning of the current crisis of utopia? And is this crisis a
development to be regretted or cherished? In order to answer these
questions it is crucial to enumerate the conditions of possibility and
the basic characteristics of utopian thinking. First of all [it seems
that the need for utopian meaning arises in periods of increased
uncertainty, social instability and conflict, when the element of the
political subverts the fantasmatic stability of our political
reality]{.underline}. [Utopias are generated by the surfacing of grave
antagonisms and dislocations in the social field]{.underline}. As
Tillich has put it '**[all utopias strive to negate the negative...in
human existence; it is the negative in that existence which makes the
idea of utopia necessary']{.underline}** (Tillich in Levitas, 1990:103).
Utopia then is one of the possible responses to the ever-present
negativity, to the real antagonism which is constitutive of human
experience. Furthermore, from the time of More's Utopia (1516) it is
conceived as an answer to the negativity inherent in concrete political
antagonism. What is, however, the exact nature of this response?
[Utopias are images of future human communities in which these
antagonisms and the dislocations fuelling them]{.underline} (the element
of the political) [will be forever resolved, leading to a reconciled and
harmonious world]{.underline}---it is not a coincidence that, among
others, Fourier names his utopian community 'Harmony' and that the name
of the Owenite utopian community in the New World was 'New Harmony'. As
Marin has put it, utopia sets in view an imaginary resolution to social
contradiction; it is a simulacrum of synthesis which dissimulates social
antagonism by projecting it onto a screen representing a harmonious and
immobile equilibrium (Marin, 1984:61). This final resolution is the
essence of the utopian promise. What I will try to do in this chapter
is, first of all, to demonstrate the deeply problematic nature of
utopian politics. Simply put, my argument will be that [**every utopian
fantasy construction needs a 'scapegoat' in order to constitute
itself**---the Nazi utopian fantasy and the production of the 'Jew' is a
good example]{.underline}, especially as pointed out in Žižek's
analysis.4 **[Every utopian fantasy produces its reverse and calls for
its elimination]{.underline}**. Put another way, [the beatific side of
fantasy is coupled in utopian constructions with a horrific side, a
paranoid need for a stigmatised scapegoat.]{.underline} [The
naivety---and also the danger---of utopian structures is revealed when
the realisation of this fantasy is attempted. It is then that we are
brought close to the frightening kernel of the real: **stigmatisation is
followed by extermination**]{.underline}. This is not an accident[. It
is inscribed in the structure of utopian constructions;]{.underline} it
seems to be the way all fantasy constructions work. If in almost all
utopian visions, violence and antagonism are eliminated, [if utopia is
based on the expulsion and repression of violence (this is its beatific
side) this is only because it owes its own creation to violence; it is
sustained and fed by violence]{.underline} (this is its horrific side).
This repressed moment of violence resurfaces, as Marin points out, in
the difference inscribed in the name utopia itself (Marin, 1984:110).
What we shall argue is that [it also resurfaces in the production of the
figure of an enemy]{.underline}. To use a phrase enunciated by the
utopianist Fourier, what is 'driven out through the door comes back
through the window' (is not this a 'precursor' of Lacan's dictum that
'what is foreclosed in the symbolic reappears in the real'?---VII:131).5
The work of Norman Cohn and other historians permits the articulation of
a genealogy of this manichean, equivalential way of understanding the
world, from the great witch-hunt up to modern anti-Semitism, and
Lacanian theory can provide valuable insights into any attempt to
understand the logic behind this utopian operation---here the approach
to fantasy developed in Chapter 2 will further demonstrate its potential
in analysing our political experience. In fact, from the time of his
unpublished seminar on The Formations of the Unconscious, [Lacan
identified the utopian dream of a perfectly functioning society as a
highly problematic area]{.underline} (seminar of 18 June 1958). In order
to realise the problematic character of the utopian operation it is
necessary to articulate a genealogy of this way of representing and
making sense of the world. The work of Norman Cohn seems especially
designed to serve this purpose. What is most important is that in Cohn's
schema we can encounter the three basic characteristics of utopian
fantasies that we have already singled out: first, their link to
instances of disorder, to the element of negativity[. Since human
experience is a continuous battle with the unexpected there is always a
need to represent and master this unexpected, to transform disorder to
order. Second, this representation is usually articulated as a total and
universal representation, a promise of absolute mastery of the totality
of the real, a vision of the end of history. A future utopian state is
envisaged in which disorder will be totally eliminated. Third, this
symbolisation produces its own remainder; there is always a certain
particularity remaining outside the universal schema]{.underline}. [It
is to the existence of this evil agent, which can be easily localised,
that all persisting disorder is attributed. The elimination of disorder
depends then on the **elimination of this group. The result is always
horrible: persecution, massacres, holocausts**]{.underline}. Needless to
say, no utopian fantasy is ever realised as a result of all these
'crimes'---as mentioned in Chapter 2, the purpose of fantasy is not to
satisfy an (impossible) desire but to constitute it as such. What is of
great interest for our approach is the way in which Cohn himself
articulates a genealogy of the pair utopia/demonisation in his books The
Pursuit of the Millennium and Europe's Inner Demons (Cohn, 1993b,
1993c). The same applies to his book Warrant for Genocide (Cohn, 1996)
which will also be implicated at a certain stage in our analysis. These
books are concerned with the same social phenomenon, the idea of
purifying humanity through the extermination of some category of human
beings which are conceived as agents of corruption, disorder and evil.
The contexts are, of course, different, but the urge remains the same
(Cohn, 1993b:xi). All these works then, at least according to my
reading, are concerned with the production of an archenemy which goes
together with the utopian mentality. It could be argued that the roots
of both demonisation and utopian thinking can be traced back to the
shift from a cyclical to a unilinear representation of history (Cohn,
1993a:227).6 However, we will start our reading of Cohn's work by going
back to Roman civilisation. As Cohn claims, a profound demonising
tendency is discernible in Ancient Rome: within the imperium, the Romans
accused the Christians of cannibalism and the Jews were accused by
Greeks of ritual murder and cannibalism. [Yet in the ancient Roman
world, although Judaism was regarded as a bizarre religion, it was
nevertheless a religio licita, a religion that was officially
recognised. Things were different with the newly formed Christian sect.
In fact the Christian Eucharist could easily be interpreted as
cannibalistic (Cohn, 1993b:8). In almost all their ways Christians
ignored or even negated the fundamental convictions by which the pagan
Graeco-Roman world lived]{.underline}. It is not at all surprising then
that to the Romans they looked like a bunch of conspirators plotting to
destroy society. Towards the end of the second century, according to
Tertullian, it was taken as a given that the Christians are the cause of
every public catastrophe, every disaster that hits the populace. If the
Tiber floods or the Nile fails to, if there is a drought or an
earthquake, a famine or a plague, the cry goes up at once: 'Throw the
Christians to the Lions!'. (Tertullian in Cohn, 1993b:14) This
defamation of Christians that led to their exclusion from the boundaries
of humanity and to their relentless persecution is a pattern that was
repeated many times in later centuries, when both the persecutors and
the persecuted were Christians (Cohn, 1993b:15). Bogomiles, Waldensians,
the Fraticelli movement and the Cathars---all the groups appearing in
Umberto Eco's fascinating books, especially in The Name of the
Rose---were later on persecuted within a similar discursive context. The
same happened with the demonisation of Christians, the fantasy that led
to the great witch-hunt. Again, the conditions of possibility for this
demonisation can be accurately defined. First, some kind of misfortune
or catastrophe had to occur, and second, there had to be someone who
could be singled out as the cause of this misfortune (Cohn, 1993b:226).
In Cohn's view then, [social dislocation and unrest, on the one hand,
and millenarian exaltation, on the other, do overlap. When segments of
the poor population were mesmerised by a prophet, their understandable
desire to improve their living conditions became transfused with
fantasies of a future community reborn into innocence through a final,
apocalyptic massacre]{.underline}. The evil ones---variously identified
with the Jews, the clergy or the rich---were to be exterminated; after
which the Saints---i.e. the poor in question---would set up their
kingdom, a realm without suffering or sin. (Cohn, 1993c:14--15) It was
at times of acute dislocation and disorientation that this demonising
tendency was more present. When people were faced with a situation
totally alien to their experience of normality, when they were faced
with unfamiliar hazards dislocating their constructions of
reality---when they encountered the real---the collective flight into
the world of demonology could occur more easily (ibid.: 87). The same
applies to the emergence of millenarian fantasies. The vast majority of
revolutionary millenarian outbreaks takes place against a background of
disaster. Cohn refers to the plagues that generated the first Crusade
and the flagellant movements of 1260, 1348--9, 1391 and 1400, the
famines that preluded the first and second Crusade, the pseudo-Baldwin
movement and other millenarian outbreaks and, of course, the Black Death
that precipitated a whole wave of millenarian excitement (ibid.: 282).7
It is perhaps striking that all the characteristics we have encountered
up to now are also marking modern phenomena such as Nazi anti-Semitic
utopianism. In fact, in the modern anti-Semitic fantasy the remnants of
past demonological terrors are blended with anxieties and resentments
emerging for the first time with modernity (Cohn, 1996:27). In
structural terms the situation remains pretty much the same. [The first
condition of possibility for its emergence is the dislocation of
traditional forms of organising and making sense of society, a
dislocation inflicted by the increased hegemony of secularism,
liberalism, socialism, industrialisation, etc. Faced with such
disorientating developments, people can very easily resort to a promise
for the re-establishment of a lost harmony]{.underline}. Within such a
context [Hitler proved successful in persuading the Germans that he was
their only hope.]{.underline} Heartfield's genius [collages exposing the
dark kernel of National Socialism didn't prove very effective against
Nazi propaganda]{.underline}. It was mass unemployment, misery and
anxiety (especially of the middle classes) that led to Hitler's
hegemony, to the hegemony of the Nazi utopian promise. At the very time
when German society was turning into one of the great industrial powers
of Europe, a land of factories and cities, technology and bureaucracy,
many Germans were dreaming of an archaic world of Germanic peasants,
organically linked by bonds of blood in a 'natural' community. Yet, as
Cohn very successfully points out, 'such a view of the world requires an
anti-figure, and this was supplied partly by the liberal West but also,
and more effectively, by the Jews' (Cohn, 1996:188). [The emergence of
the Jew as a modern antichrist follows directly from this structural
necessity for an **anti-figure**.]{.underline} Rosenberg, Goebbels and
other (virtually all) Nazi ideologues used the phantom of the Jewish
race as a lynch-pin binding the fears of the past and prospective
victims of modernisation, which they articulated, and the ideal volkish
society of the future which they proposed to create in order to
forestall further advances of modernity. (Bauman, 1989:61) No doubt the
idea of a Jewish world conspiracy is a revival, in a secularised form,
of certain apocalyptic beliefs. There is clearly a connection between
the famous forgery known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the
antichrist prophecy (Cohn, 1996:48). The Protocols were first published
by Nilus as part of his book The Great in the Small: Antichrist
Considered as an Imminent Political Possibility and were published in
1917 with the title He is Near, At the Door...Here comes Antichrist and
the Reign of the Devil on Earth. As the famous Nazi propagandist
Rosenberg points out 'One of the advance signs of the coming struggle
for the new organisation of the world is this understanding of the very
nature of the demon which has caused our present downfall. Then the way
will be open for a new age' (Rosenberg in Cohn, 1996:217). [Within this
schema the elimination of the antichrist, that is the Jews, is
considered as the remedy for all dislocations, the key to a new
harmonious world]{.underline}. [Jews were seen as deserving death (and
resented for that reason) because they stood between this one imperfect
and tension-ridden reality and the hoped-for world of tranquil
happiness...the disappearance of the Jews was instrumental in bringing
about the world of perfection]{.underline}. (Bauman, 1989:76) As Sartre
claims, for the anti-Semite the Good itself is reduced to the
destruction of Evil. Underneath the bitterness of the anti-Semite one
can only reveal the optimistic belief that harmony will be reconstituted
of itself, once Evil is destroyed. When the mission of the anti-Semite
as holy destroyer is fulfilled, the lost paradise will be re-established
(Sartre, 1995:43--5).8 In Adorno's words, 'charging the Jews with all
existing evils seems to penetrate the darkness of reality like a
searchlight and to allow for quick and all-comprising orientation.... It
is the great Panacea...the key to everything' (Adorno, 1993:311, my
emphasis). Simply put, [the elimination of the Jew is posited as the
only thing that can transform the Nazi dream to reality, the only thing
that can realise utopia.9 As it is pointed out by an American Nazi
propagandist, 'our problem is very simple. Get rid of the Jews and we'd
be on the way to Utopia tomorrow.]{.underline} The Jews are the root of
all our trouble' (True in Cohn, 1996:264, my emphasis). The same is, of
course, true of Stalinism. Zygmunt Bauman brings the two cases together:
Hitler's and Stalin's victims were not killed in order to capture and
colonise the territory they occupied.... They were killed because they
did not fit, for one reason or another, the scheme of a perfect society.
Their killing was not the work of destruction but creation. They were
eliminated, so that an objectively better human world---more efficient,
more moral, more beautiful---could be established. A Communist world. Or
a racially pure, Aryan world. In both cases, a harmonious world,
conflict free, docile in the hands of their rulers, orderly, controlled.
(Bauman, 1989:93) In any case, one should not forget that the fact that
the anti-figure in Nazi ideology came to be the Jew is not an essential
but a contingent development. In principle, it could have been anyone.
Any of us can be a substitute for the Jew. And this is not a mere
theoretical possibility. [In the]{.underline}ir classical [study of the
authoritarian personality Theodor Adorno and his colleagues point out
that '**subjects in our sample find numerous other substitutes for the
Jew, such as the Mexicans and the Greeks'**]{.underline} (Adorno,
1993:303). Although the need for the structural position of the
anti-figure remains constant the identity of the 'subject' occupying
that position is never given a priori. This does not mean that within a
certain historical configuration with a particular social sedimentation
and hegemonic structure all the possibilities are open to the same
extent; it means though that in principle nobody is excluded from being
stigmatised. [Of course, the decision on who will eventually be
stigmatised depends largely on the availability within a particular
social configuration of groups that can perform this role in social
fantasy, and this availability is socially constructed out of the
existing materials]{.underline}. As Lacan points out in Anxiety,
[although a lack or a void can be filled in several ways]{.underline}
(in principle), [experience---and]{.underline}, in fact, [analytic
experience---shows that it is never actually filled in 99 different
ways]{.underline} (seminar of 21 November 1962). [What we
have]{.underline} here [is basically **a play of
incarnation**]{.underline}. **[This play of incarnation is marking both
the pole of the utopian fantasies and the pole of the evil powers that
stand between us and them]{.underline}**. As Cohn concludes, Middle Ages
prophecies had a deep effect on the political attitudes of the times.
For people in the Middle Ages, the drama of the Last Days was not a
distant and hazy but an infallible prophecy which at any given moment
was felt to be on the point of fulfilment: In even the most unlikely
reigns chroniclers tried to perceive that harmony among Christians, that
triumph over misbelievers, that unparalleled plenty and prosperity which
were going to be the marks of the new Golden Age. When each time
experience brought the inevitable disillusionment people merely imagined
the glorious consummation postponed to the next reign. (Cohn, 1993c:35)
But this fantasy cannot be separated by the coming of the antichrist
which was even more tensely awaited. Generation after generation of
medieval people lived in continuous expectation of signs of the
antichrist, and since these signs, as presented in the prophecies,
included comets, plague, bad rulers, famine, etc. a similar play of
incarnation was played out in terms of determining the true face of the
antichrist (ibid.).

#### Utopian fantasy is sustained by the necessary alien other who is then easily scapegoated when the political project falls short of "expected" solvency

**Stavrakakis 99** (Yannis Stavrakakis has PhD degrees from the
'Ideology and Discourse Analysis' programme at the University of Essex,
"Lacan and the Political", p.93-94, 10/3/99)

In the light of our theoretical framework, [**fantasy can only exist as
the negation of real dislocation, as a negation of the generalised
lack**, the antagonism that crosses the field of the social. Fantasy
negates the real by promising to realise it, by promising to close the
gap between the real and reality, by repressing the discursive nature of
reality's production. **Yet any promise of absolute positivity the
construction of an imaginarised false real is founded on a
violent/negative origin**]{.underline}; it [is sustained by the
exclusion of a real a non-domesticated real which always returns to its
place. **Sustaining a promise of full positivity leads to a
proliferation of negativity**]{.underline}. As we have already pointed
out, [**the fantasy of a utopian harmonious social order can only be
sustained if all the persisting disorders can be attributed to an alien
intruder**. Since the realisation of the utopian fantasy is impossible,
utopian discourse can remain hegemonically appealing only if it
attributes this impossibility that is to say, its own ultimate
impossibility to an alien intruder.]{.underline} As Sartre has put it
[the anti-Semite is in the unhappy position of having a vital need for
the very enemy he wishes to destroy]{.underline} (Sartre, 1995:28). [The
impossibility of the Nazi utopia cannot be incorporated within utopian
discourse. This truth is not easy to admit; it is easier to attribute
all negativity to the Jew: All that is bad in society (crises, wars,
famines, upheavals, and revolts) is]{.underline} directly or indirectly
[imputable to him. **The anti-Semite is afraid of discovering that the
world is ill- contrived, for then it would be necessary for him to
invent and modify, with the result that man would be found to be the
master of his own destinies, burdened with an agonising and infinite
responsibility**. Thus he localises all the evil of the universe in the
Jews]{.underline}. (Sartre, 1995:40) 12 As Jerrold Post has pointed out,
[we are always bound to those we hate: **We need enemies to keep our
treasured and idealised selves intact**]{.underline} (Post, 1996:28-9).
And this for fear of being free (Sartre, 1995:27). [The fantasy of
attaining a perfect harmonious world, of realising the universal, can
only be sustained through the construction/localisation of a certain
particularity which cannot be assimilated but]{.underline}, instead,
[has to be eliminated. There exists]{.underline} then [a crucial
dialectic between the universal fantasy of utopia and the particularity
of the always local enemy who is posited as negating it. The result of
this dialectic is always the same: **The tragic paradox of utopianism
has been that instead of bringing about**]{.underline}, as it promised,
**[a system of final and permanent stability, it gave rise to utter
restlessness, and in place of a reconciliation between human freedom and
social cohesion, it brought totalitarian coercion.]{.underline}**

3\. OBEDIENCE, POWERLESSNESS, AND GRANDIOSITY AND DESPAIR [Obedience to
the commands and appeals of leaders and governments also appears to be
related strongly to feelings of powerlessness.]{.underline} [[Citizens
are often heard saying, \"there\'s nothing I can do about it,\" \"my
vote doesn\'t count,\"]{.mark} [\"the experts know best,\"]{.mark} and
\"no one listens to the little guy**.\" [Feelings of powerless- ness can
also lead to]{.mark} the seductiveness of [vicarious experience of power
through identification with national military might and its
use]{.mark}**[. Powerlessness is a]{.mark} real [fact of our]{.mark} own
[imperfect democracy, with its size and complexity,]{.mark} its [unequal
access to political influence, and]{.mark} its [consequent low levels of
participation.]{.mark}]{.underline} But there is an additional factor of
self-fulfilling perceptions of powerlessness-what Michael Lerner (1986)
has called \"surplus powerlessness.\" This surplus can be given cultural
and socioeconomic explanations, such as Lerner\'s. Psychoanalytic
insights can supplement-not supplant-these accounts by illuminating
early developmental origins of feelings of powerlessness which increase
a person\'s susceptibility to disempowering cultural and social
influences. Clinical evidence on powerlessness, like splitting, has
emerged from the widening scope of psychoanalytic treatment. The analyst
who uncovers in the patient split images of good and evil parents is
also likely to see indications of euphoric fantasies of power expressed
in grandiose projects and inflated self- images (Kernberg, 1975; Kohut,
1971; Winnicott, 1971). When reality punctures the balloon of grandiose
fantasy, an underlying despairing feeling of helpless- ness-of being
under the control of overwhelming powerful figures-emerges. It appears
that in this despairing, depressed state the person has little access to
feelings of anger or grief that would give the self a sense of solidity
and strength. If such feelings break through, the person is terrified of
them and they are quickly repressed. The terror seems to involve both a
fear of outside punishment for having unacceptable feelings and a fear
of inner disintegration because the intense feelings would shatter the
fragile self. Having uncovered these patterns in more disturbed
patients, it is now possible to recognize them in patients generally and
to detect indirect evidence in cultural materials of their presence in
the population at large. Theoretically, and with the aid of evidence
from parent-child observation and psychotherapy with children and so on
(see above), we can reconstruct the developmental origins of these
clinical findings as follows: distress lets this be known in no
uncertain terms. It will cry, kick and thrash, scream, and bite. Adult
humans find these signals disturbing, and they typically respond by
moving to diagnose and to minister to the child\'s need (Bowlby, 1969).
We can conclude that this is adaptive behavior on the child\'s part and
has been selected for in the process of evolution. As for the child,
when it obtains the expected and needed parental response, it is
confirmed in the rightness of its needs and feelings and the efficacy of
their expression (Miller, 1981). A basis is built for a s of personal
power as an adult. [For some parents, however, the child\'s pain and
anger are intolerable. They stir up feelings repressed since the
parents\' own childhoods, which they still are unable to handle
(Fraiberg, 1980; Miller, 1981). Even the child\'s joyful feelings may be
resented, out of jealousy, or be simply unacknowledged because of a
parent\'s depressed state.]{.underline} Finally, a narcissistic fantasy
of being the perfect parent is disrupted if a child expresses needs and
negative feelings. [Thus parents may seek to suppress a child\'s
feelings rather than to satisfy the underlying need.]{.underline} The
child is commanded to cease crying. Directly or indirectly, the parents
communi- cate that they will leave, or withdraw their affection, or
commit violence if the child doesn\'t comply. [The child learns an
immediate lesson that it is powerless to get its needs met. It learns to
suppress its expressive behavior, robbing itself of the instruments for
personal power and for reality-testing about power in the
future.]{.underline} Children are extraordinarily resilient and
adaptive. [They develop other ways of coping. In particular they learn
to be acutely sensitive to their parents\' desires and to perform in
ways to satisfy those desires-thus extracting a mod- icum of recognition
from the parents and avoiding provoking their anger (Miller, 1981).
These skills give the child a certain sense of competence and control-of
empowerment. These interpersonal skills may be of great use to this same
person later as an adult working in management, sales, helping
professions, politics, and so on. But such effectiveness has been
purchased at the price of sacrificing the person\'s own needs in favor
of responsiveness to others. Underneath this surface competence and
assurance will be a deep despairing sense of powerless-
ness.]{.underline} [[The political impact of such underlying
dispositions]{.mark} and compensations is not difficult to trace.
Underlying feelings of personal powerlessness [can easily amplify and
distort]{.mark} [feelings of political powerlessness]{.mark} evoked by
negative experi- ence in the political system. [Passive obedience is
likely]{.mark} to ensue, [but]{.mark} several other outcomes are also
possible. Compensation by means of grandiose fantasies [can lend itself
to alignment with grandiose national goals of conquest, invulnera-
bility, and superiority]{.mark}. [Rebellious grandiose fantasies can
lead to]{.mark} revolutionary projects that are absurdly out of touch
with realities. This results in [self-defeating projects and a renewed
despairing feeling of powerlessness-on the part of sympathetic witnesses
as well as participants.]{.mark} Michael Lerner (1986) sees this as a
dynamic in the 1960s New Left. [Compensatory power through abnegation of
one\'s own needs and serving and/or manipulating others needs can be a

journal*, #83, June 2017, //Stefan\]

Depression can evolve in different ways: if you look at the present
reality of America, you see that the prevailing evolution of depression
is Donald Trump. "The worst are full of passionate intensity," says
Yeats[. Faith in belonging and identity is the fake ground of passionate
intensity. Belonging implies a natural ontological or historical ground
of conformity among individuals. This is why belonging implies violence
and submission. If you want to belong, you have to accept the rules of
conformity. Identity is the result of this process of conformity and
subjection.]{.underline} Passionate intensity is the foundation of the
identity that humiliated people crave. [But identity has to be protected
against existence, against transformation]{.underline}, against
becoming, [against pleasure, because pleasure is dis-identity. Identity
is a simulation of belonging that is asserted through violence against
the other]{.underline}. "Surely the second coming is at hand. / ... a
vast image out of Spiritus Mundi / Troubles my sight." In 1919, Yeats
expected the second coming of Jesus Christ. However, in the decade that
followed, Jesus Christ did not come back. Hitler came. So we should ask:
What is going to happen now? I'll try to reframe the present situation
from the point of view of rhythm. In particular, I want to say something
about algorithm and biorhythm. Rhythm is the singularization of time.
Rhythm is scanning time in attunement with cosmic breathing. Rhythm is
the vibration that aims to harmonize the singularity of breathing and
the surrounding chaos. Poetry is the error that leads to new continents
of meaning. Although the theory of biorhythm elaborated by Wilhelm
Fliess at the end of the nineteenth century is generally considered
pseudoscientific, I'm interested in its metaphorical implications. The
organism is composed of vibrant matter, and the pulsations of the
organism enter into a rhythmic relationship with the pulsations of other
surrounding organisms. [The conjunction of conscious and sensitive
organisms is a vibrating relationship: individual organisms search for a
common rhythm, a common emotional ground of understanding]{.underline},
and this search is a sort of oscillation that results in a possible (or
impossible) syntony. Within the conjunctive sphere of biorhythm, the
process of signification and interpretation is a vibrational process.
[When the process of signification is penetrated by connective machines,
it is reformatted. It mutates in a way that implies a reduction: a
reduction to the syntactic logic of the algorithm.]{.underline} The word
"algorithm" comes from the name of the Arabic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi
(meaning, a native of Khwarazm), whose work introduced sophisticated
mathematics to the West. However, I prefer a different etymology and a
different meaning. "Algorithm" for me has to do with the Greek word
algos, meaning pain. Furthermore, the English word "algid" refers to
frigidity, both physical and emotional. So I suggest that "algorithm"
has to do with frigidity and pain. This pain results from the
constriction of the organism, the stiffening of the vibrational agent of
enunciation, and the reduction of the continuum of experience to the
dictates of computation. [When the social concatenation is mediated by
connective machines, human agency undergoes a process of
reformatting.]{.underline} No one really knows what human agency is, or
what humans are doing when they are said to perform as agents. In the
face of every analysis, human agency remains something of a mystery. If
we don't know just how it is that human agency operates, how can we be
so sure that the processes through which nonhumans make their mark are
qualitatively different? An assemblage owes its agentic capacity to the
vitality of the materialities that constitute it. Something like this
congregational agency is called shi in Chinese tradition. Shi helps to
illuminate something that is usually difficult to capture in discourse:
namely the kind of potential that originates not in human initiative but
instead results from the very disposition of things. Shi is the style,
energy propensity, trajectory, or élan inherent to a specific
arrangement of things. Originally a word used in military strategy, shi
emerged in the description of a good general who must be able to read
and then ride the shi of a configuration of moods, winds, historical
trends, and armaments: shi names the dynamic force emanating from a
spatio-temporal configuration rather than from any particular element
within it ... The shi of an assemblage is vibratory.[2 When the
algorithm enters the realm of social concatenation, modes of interaction
undergo a reformatting process, and algorithmic logic pervades and
subjugates the vibrant concatenation. The insertion of the algorithm
into the semiotic process breaks the continuum of semiosis and
life]{.underline}. In the connective domain, [interpretation is reduced
to the syntactical recognition of discreet states. The vibrational sign
is stiffened, to the point of losing the ability to decode and to
interpret ambiguousness and irony. Difference is then interpreted
according to the rules of repetition, and the indetermination that makes
poetical misunderstanding (or hyper-understanding) possible is
cancelled. As the semiosphere is reformatted according to the algorithm,
the vibratory nature of biorhythm is suffocated. Breathing is banished
from the semiotic exchange,]{.underline} and poetry---the error that
leads to the discovery of new continents of meaning, [the excess that
contains new imaginings and new possibilities]{.underline}---[is
frozen]{.underline}. This is what Guattari called a chaosmic spasm.

### Academic Demography

#### Though seemingly radical in content, the aff mimics liberal multiculturalism on the level of form- the presentation of the 1AC against the broader backdrop of the racial Symbolic only serves to uphold that structure, allowing the university and false narratives of inclusion to coopt their strategy

**Viego 07** \[Antonio Viego, Professor of Ethnic Studies @ Duke, *Dead
Subjects: Toward a Politics of Loss in Latino Studies*, 2014, \*brackets
for gendered language\* //Stefan\]

A passage from the essay brings together several topics that I have been
tracking throughout this chapter, but I am mostly interested in the idea
that Lacan develops regarding the ego psychologists' reduction of their
difference--- which I read here as their Jewish ethnic and cultural
difference---to their function---as ''managers of the soul''---and in
how we might read this idea in concert with Chow's theory of ''coercive
mimeticism.'' This may resonate in our current situation concerning [the
ethnic-racialized pedagogue's role in teaching ''difference,'' managing
souls, in contemporary multicultural and diversity-driven U.S.
university settings.]{.underline} Lacan writes: The shock waves were to
reverberate to the very conﬁnes of our world, echoing on a continent
where it would be untrue to say that history loses its meaning, since it
is where history ﬁnds its limit. It would even be a mistake to think
that history is absent there, since, already several centuries in
duration, it weighs all the more heavily there due to the gulf traced
out by its all-too-limited horizon[. Rather it is where history is
denied with a categorical will that gives enterprises their style, that
of cultural ahistoricism characteristic of the United States of North
America. This ahistoricism deﬁnes the assimilation required for one to
be recognized there, in the society constituted by this culture. It was
to its summons that a group of emigrants had to respond; in order to
gain recognition, they could only stress their difference, but their
function presupposed history at its very core]{.underline}, their
discipline being the one that had reconstructed the bridge between
modern man and ancient myths. The combination of circumstances was too
strong and the opportunity too attractive for them not to give in to the
temptation to abandon the core in order to base function on difference.
Let us be clear about the nature of this temptation. It was neither that
of ease nor that of proﬁt. It is certainly easier to efface the
principles of a doctrine than the stigmata of one's origins, and more
proﬁtable to subordinate one's function to demand. But to reduce one's
function to one's difference in this case is to give in to a mirage that
is internal to the function itself, a mirage that grounds the function
in this difference. It is to return to the reactionary principle that
covers over the duality of he who suffers and he who heals with the
opposition between he who knows and he who does not. How could they
avoid regarding this opposition as true when it is real and, on that
basis, avoid slipping into becoming managers of souls in a social
context that demands such ofﬁces? The most corrupting of comforts is
intellectual comfort, just as the worst corruption is corruption of the
best.∑π The ''troika'' sold out, Lacan maintains, for recognition, for
money; they confused recognition with the receipt of money. Still, I ﬁnd
Lacan here uncharacteristically generous when he remarks that certain
cultural factors were working on the ego psychologists---''This
ahistoricism (characteristic of the United States) deﬁnes the
assimilation required for one to be recognized there, in the society
constituted by this culture''; ''in order to gain recognition, they
could only stress their difference''; ''The combination of circumstances
was too strong and the opportunity too attractive''; ''How could they
avoid . . . slipping into becoming managers of souls in a social context
that demands such ofﬁces?'' When Chow writes, ''the level at which [the
ethnic person is expected to come to resemble what is recognizably
ethnic . . . to resemble and replicate the very banal preconceptions
that have been appended to them, a process in which they are expected to
objectify themselves in accordance with the already seen and thus to
authenticate the familiar imaginings of them as ethnics]{.underline}''
to diagnose a contemporary dilemma for ethnic-racialized subjects in the
United States, how can we not hear in it the same charge and diagnosis
in Lacan's critique above: ''But to reduce one's function to one's
difference is to give in to a mirage that is internal to the function
itself, a mirage that grounds the function in this difference''? If the
culture of assimilation in North America has changed somewhat in the
time between Lacan's remarks and Chow's, it is with respect to what is
to be assimilated. Instead of the 1950s edict ''turn white or
disappear,'' [it's more like ''turn mottled or disappear'' at the
beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century]{.underline} in the United States.
According to both Lacan's and Chow's diagnoses, these [coercive
assimilatory imperatives operate on the condition that the subject be
confused with the ego and that whatever conﬂicts present themselves are
to be remedied with the strengthening of the ego]{.underline}. If Lacan
can be said to link the confusion of the subject with the ego in
ego-psychological theory---the sine qua non, according to him, of the
distortion of Freudian theory---to certain North American assimilatory
imperatives with which the ego psychologists had to contend, then we can
say that Chow illustrates the outcome of this confusion---of the subject
with the ego---in a contemporary situation as the price to be paid for
ethnic-racialized subjects to be legible subjects in the United States.
In the passage from ''The Freudian Thing,'' we also have what qualiﬁes
as a commentary on the ''privileged marginal,'' to use John Champagne's
resonant term: ''privileged members of cultural minorities whose
disciplinary role is to contain the threat of a much more radical
deployment of difference that might destabilize homogeneous intellectual
culture.''∑∫ [The ''privileged marginal'']{.underline} I have in mind,
depending on the particular vicissitudes of his experience in an
institution where he [has been entrusted with the task of disseminating
the knowledge of cultural differences]{.underline}---for example, as a
representative of Latino studies---[will have, no doubt, been coerced or
compelled to reduce \[their\] function to his difference. He sells out.
\[They need\] the job. \[They are\] a diversity manager of
souls?]{.underline} A manager of diversiﬁed souls? A diversiﬁer of
managed souls? Prior to his involvement in the university's elaboration
of the discourses on multiculturalism and diversity, what will be deﬁned
as ''diversity'' will have already been subjected to a kind of
management, so that diversity, now inoculated, can be dispersed and
dispensed safely. [The concern with safety comes from the desire to
safeguard the university from any real transformation in the politics of
knowledge production that a more infectious, more generatively noxious,
unsafe notion of diversity might compel. How might the ''privileged
marginal'' subject craft more transgressive uses of]{.underline} [her
difference, to which]{.underline} [\[their\] function has been
reduced,]{.underline} given that the dictates of ''coercive mimeticism''
have already worked her over in lending her pedagogical authority to
begin with? Lacan might be said to have at least once referred to
something like multiculturalism: ''With our jouissance going off the
track, only the Other is able to mark its position, but only insofar as
we are separated from this Other. Whence certain fantasies---unheard of
before the melting pot. Leaving the Other to his own mode of jouissance,
that would only be possible by not imposing our own on him, by not
thinking of him as underdeveloped.''∑Ω Dylan Evans's gloss on this
passage is revealing: ''But as soon as we are forced to have recourse to
the Other in order to mark the position of our own jouissance . . . a
curious paradox results. On the one hand, we need to preserve the
jouissance of the Other in order to be able to deﬁne our own; but on the
other hand, we seek to destroy that Other enjoyment because we suspect
it may be more superabundant than our own.''∏≠ [We are left with a
vicious Imaginary a-dynamic: on the one hand, a ruthless refusal to
grant psychical complexity to ethnic-racialized subjects, which is to
say, the refusal of the lack that generates desire and the subject's
incalculability that springs from the human subject's inscription in
language, coupled with the weird generosity--- the compensatory
psychical act of those in power---that offers a pure, riotous Beingness
followed by a kind of disgust and shame for the ethnic-racialized
subject's perceived unbounded pleasure, which, in turn, necessitates
strategies to circumscribe and destroy those very lives.]{.underline}

### Coercive Mimeticism

#### Specifically, that framing of race produces a standard of "recognizable ethnicity" that results in forms of authenticity testing and color checking which outweigh and turn the case

**Gatzambide 14** \[Daniel J. Gatzambide, adjunct lecturer @ Hunter,
*I'm not black, I'm not white, what am I? The illusion of the color
line*, *Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society*, 19(1), //Stefan\]

What we often refer to as "[the color line" between Black and
White]{.underline} suddenly [becomes a psycho-political chess
match]{.underline}, complete with the stereotypical black and white
squares and pieces. Players forth across the board. Depending on the
context and content of the discussion, [[all that does not fit neatly
into a very specific category of]{.mark} what is "[White]{.mark}"
[or]{.mark} what is "[Black]{.mark}" [is]{.mark} simply [exchanged and
lumped together]{.mark} on the other side]{.underline}. In the case of
some black men and women, [[they may be "Black," but due to the
complexity and nuance of their experience, be deemed "not Black enough"
and lumped in with white people]{.underline}]{.mark}. Comedian, activist
and political commentator Elon James White et al (2012) have discussed
how this process, which they call "[blackchecking," defines a distinct
set of traits as distinguishing what is "Black" from what is not.
If]{.underline} -- as an African American -- [the profile of your
identity does not fit within those coordinates, you are]{.underline}
being something ["not-Black." [The credibility of your identity
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [then [challenged. You don't dress Black," you
don't look, sound, taste, and act
"Black]{.underline}]{.mark}[."]{.underline} Black-checking, or
"[[color-checking" more broadly, rages across the]{.mark} zigzagging
[twists and turns of the color-line. Color-checking implies that]{.mark}
at some level [one can draw a clear]{.mark} and [concise boundary
between what is an ethnic minority -- and]{.mark} hence [worthy
of]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[the]{.mark} legal and [social protections
that entails -- and what is not]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nowhere is this
clearer that in the case of non-African-American ethnic minorities.
Middle-Eastern, Asian, Southeast-Asian, Pacific-Islander, Latino/
Latin-American, African, Afro-Caribbean, and other
[[non-African-American minorities have faced histories of]{.mark}
colonialism, egregious poverty, violence, as well as [social
injustice]{.mark} within Western countries.]{.underline} [[At the same
time,]{.mark} depending on context, various [narratives of social
triumph]{.mark} or so-called "model minority" status [have been
articulated in order to digest these minorities into the categories of
whiteness]{.mark} and privilege.]{.underline} Take the case of Middle
Eastern communities. On the one hand, many Arabs are seen as falling
into the category of "White," according to the Federal Government's
definition of what is "White" (United States Census Bureau, 2012). On
the other hand, Arabs, Persians, and also South Asians have been
consistently vilified, persecuted, and oppressed in the United States,
Canada, Europe, and Australia and stereotyped as (non-White) terrorists
threatening the social order.1 [[The color line narrows and expands
based on political necessity and psychological conflict, constricting
and suffocating us]{.mark}, leaving little air for complexity, nuance,
or political and individual freedom.]{.underline} I think of JJ, a
teacher of Afro-Caribbean descent, who attended a workshop on racial
biases in education. She was interested in addressing discipline
practices that disproportionately affected children of color. JJ found
herself in agreement with the speaker's assessment of racial dynamics in
schools and society more broadly, but found the confrontational approach
for dealing with White racial obliviousness advocated in the workshop to
be problematic. She voiced her agreement with the speaker's analysis of
race, but also expressed her concern that the methods articulated for
addressing lack of awareness among whites might shut down dialogue
instead of opening new lines of inquiry and exploration. In response, JJ
was accused of being "White-identified," told that her parents "didn't
raise her right," and that she "wasn't really Black." She was either not
Black enough, or told that her Afro-Caribbean heritage -- as opposed to
being strictly African-American -- had blinded her to the realities of
racism in the United States. I also think of Amy, a South Asian social
work student. During her participation in a cultural consciousness
workshop, the ethnic minorities in the room were asked by the group
leader to sit in the center of the circle and discuss their experiences
of discrimination and mistreatment. This was intended as an exercise in
which white students could learn from the experiences of their peers of
color. Over the course of the training, Amy noted that she felt
conflicted. On the one hand she could readily bring to awareness her own
experiences with prejudice due to being a Brown woman. Yet she also had
an awareness of herself as economically privileged due to her family's
class background. She verbalized this ambivalence to the group. The
group leader responded that it was not their job to help Amy feel
comfortable. Amy clarified that this was not her intent -- she was not
looking for comfort -- but to expand the conversation in terms of
different identities and levels of privilege. Other Black group members
commented on the conversation. Some believed that as a Brown woman, a
South-Asian woman, she wasn't really a minority. Others said that Asians
and Southeast Asians were "model minorities" and basically White by
association, and hence didn't need any legal protection from
discrimination. Her presence in the group was in question. It almost
seemed that so long as her narrative was one of being a
discriminated-against, underprivileged minority, she was an ethnic
minority. When she added complexity by noting how she was both
underprivileged and privileged, depending on whether one focused on her
racial identity or her class status, she was color-checked and judged to
be White. These examples can be conceptualized in terms of in-group and
out-group dynamics, and there is certainly no lack of writing on this
topic in the psychoanalytic and social psychology literature. Important
as these are, the perspective I am elucidating points us toward a
different angle of vision. Part of what I am talking about here is what
the Lacanian Latino Studies scholar Antonio Viego (2007) refers to as
"[[coercive mimeticism]{.mark}," [an institutional and social practice
whereby there are certain ways in which ethnic minorities must act,
believe, dress, and be in order to present]{.mark} themselves
[as]{.mark} "recognizably ethnic," as Latino-enough, as [Black-enough,
as Asian-enough, and so forth]{.mark}. It is mimetic insofar as [one has
to look into the mirror of ethnic identity and adapt oneself to that
image, reproducing a very particular ego-identity, one that is often a
poor fit]{.mark} to one's more immediate subjective experience. It
is]{.underline} also [coercive in that [there are institutional,
cultural, and societal pressures to conform to that notion of identity
i]{.mark}n order to find one's place in the coordinates of race and
ethnicity]{.underline} -- essentially, [to be allotted a place on the
color line. We are to take up our respective place on the chessboard as
Black or White, pawns in a much bigger and deadlier game.]{.underline}
Here [we can glean both the imaginary and symbolic functions of racial
object maps. These [object maps provide coherence and integration in the
imaginary to an otherwise chaotic collection of signifiers -- the
racialized bodies in which we exist]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same
time[, [racial object maps yield symbolic categories of me and not-me,
Black and White, and a language with which to organize and
regulate]{.mark} closeness, distance, and [racial
desire]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Conversely, [what is]{.mark} contained, or
to be more precise, [excluded]{.mark}, through the symbolic and
imaginary operations of the object map [is the]{.mark} Real dimension of
race -- the [ever shifting,]{.mark} anxiety-producing, formless [nature
of the color line. When ambiguously ethnic subjects fail to see their
image]{.mark} in the mirror, when they are unable to play the language
games of race and racial signification, [there is a noticeable
discomfort and anxiety]{.mark} that sets in among those who partake in
the production of coercive mimeticism. The illusion of the color line
comes into focus, disrupting how we see and define racialized bodies,
evoking the fragmented and uncoordinated nature of the child's body
prior to]{.underline} Lacan's (2005a,b) [mirror stage. [The illusion of
wholeness,]{.mark} of being a whole body-ego -- whether White, Black, or
Brown -- [falters, revealing the]{.mark} destitute, undifferentiated,
and [broken nature of race and racial identity.]{.mark}]{.underline} [To
survive the encounter with the Real of race]{.underline}, I argue[,
paves the way for a unique kind of freedom]{.underline}. To give one
example, a Puerto Rican-ness is more malleable, flexible, and non-linear
than one bound into one static form and yields a fluidity that fosters
experimental and novel ways of responding to oppression. This
[[fluidity]{.mark}]{.underline} at the same [time [can validate]{.mark}
the ghosts of one's ancestors [while integrating]{.mark} their wisdom
[into new, emancipatory potentialities]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be
clear, I am [[not denying the importance of addressing]{.mark} colorism,
racism, and [the privileging of white skin]{.mark}]{.underline} that
exists in the Latino community and other ethnic minorities (not to
mention society as a whole). It is important for us to have that
conversation, and point out how notions of mestizaje, of hybridity in
the Latino experience, may mask underlying tensions around race and skin
color, and render the relative privilege of light-skinned Latinos such
as myself invisible. At the same time, I am proposing that [we also have
a conversation that is perpendicular to a critique of racism and
colorism, intersecting with it but going towards a different vector.
[How we exclude one another]{.mark} based on not meeting certain
expectations]{.underline} about what it means to be Latino, Asian,
Black, etc., [th[reatens to disempower us further, limiting our
political power by carving out a "minority of a
minority]{.mark}]{.underline}" as opposed to sustaining often difficult
conversations about our sameness and difference. Similarly, as Baratunde
Thurston (2011) points out in his recent book, How to be Black, often
this kind of black-checking or color-checking narrows our vision of what
it means to be Black (or Latino, or Asian, etc.). Reflecting on his own
sense of his Blackness, he writes, "One of the most consistent themes in
my own experience... is this notion of discovering your own Blackness by
embracing the new, the different, the uncommon, and, simply, yourself"
(p. 218). [[Color-checking prevents us from experimenting with]{.mark}
different forms of [dis-identification]{.mark} which enrich, challenge,
and nourish us, and [which hold the promise of new forms of
resistance,]{.mark} emancipation, and psychosocial revolt]{.underline}.
As I argue, these perpendicular conversations push and pull toward
different trajectories, but have as their intersection the most crucial
nexus of political, cultural, and social justice. So what am I, in the
end? I am whatever you want me to be: oppressor, oppressed, cracker,
spic, enemy, friend, White, Black, lover, fighter, masculine,
effeminate, strong, weak, dead or alive. Just know that with each turn,
each attempt to define me, to mark me, to confine and bind me, you free
me. Like the hysteric who produces ever shifting configurations of
symptoms in order to throw the obsessive physician off guard (see
Gherovici, 2003), I will keep producing knowledge of something else,
something other, something that is incalculable and undefinable.
Something Real. For you I'll become a Hispanic hysteric, screeching
Foucault (1972) with each symptom, with each episode of acting out, "Do
not ask me who I am and do not ask me to remain the same" (p. 17).
Because [in the end this is not really about me, or where I stand on the
color line. It is about your illusion about where you stand and where
you place yourself in the coordinates of race and ethnicity, of self and
other, of Black and White]{.underline}. In that [sense I [function as
your blank screen, receiving your projections and identifications,
hopefully returning them to you as knowledge productions that]{.mark}
question, [destabilize, and decenter your ego, paving the way for the
subject that slides in the link between signifier and signified, that
does not know if it is caused by the signifier or the signified of
race,]{.mark} but is instead, its own cause.]{.underline}

#### This card kind of explains what coercive mimeticism is pretty bad ngl

**Bowman 10** \[Paul Bowman, teaches Cultural Studies @ Cardiff
University, *Editor's Introduction*, *The Rey Chow Reader*, 2010,
\*brackets for gendered language\* //Stefan\]

Moreover, Chow points out, "[ethnicity can be used as a means of
attacking others, of shaming, belittling, and reducing them to the
condition of inauthenticity, disloyalty, and deceit]{.underline}."27
Ironically, [such attacks are "frequently issued by ethnics themselves
against fellow ethnics, that is, the people who are closest to, who are
most like them ethnically]{.underline}," in what she calls a "fraught
trajectory of coercive mimeticism."28 [Coercive mimeticism designates
the way in which the forces of all different kinds of discourses and
institutions call us into place, tell us our place, and work to keep us
in our place]{.underline}.29 These forces include (Althusserian)
interpellation and (Foucauldian) discipline. According to Chow,
[coercive mimeticism]{.underline} ultimately [works as "an
institutionalized mechanism of knowledge production and dissemination,
the point of which is to manage a non-Western ethnicity through the
disciplinary promulgation of the supposed difference]{.underline}."30 In
the words of Étienne Balibar, to whom Chow frequently refers, "The
problem is to keep 'in their place,' from generation to generation,
those who have no fixed place; and for this, it is necessary that they
have a genealogy."31 In other words, [even the work of well-meaning
specialists of ethnicity, even expert scholars of ethnicity and ethnic
experts in ethnicity, can reinforce ethnicized hierarchies structured in
dominance, simply by insisting on (re)producing their field or object:
ethnicity]{.underline}. Chow proposes that it is helpful to compare and
contrast nonwhite and white subjects, that is, "obvious" (nonwhite)
ethnics and those who have ethnicity-without-ethnicity (whiteness). In
her discussion, Chow considers the case of [nonwhite ethnic critics,
scholars, and academics.]{.underline} They, she argues, [are pressured
directly and indirectly to behave "properly"---to act and think and "be"
the way "they" are supposed to act and think and be as nonwhite ethnic
academic subjects. If they forget their ethnicity or their
nationalistically or geographically---and hence essentialistically and
positivistically---defined "cultures" and "heritages," such subjects
will be deemed to be sellouts, traitors---inauthentic]{.underline}. But,
Chow explains, [if such an ethnic scholar "should ... choose, instead,
to mimic and perform]{.underline} her [own ethnicity"---that is, to
respond or perform in terms of the implicit and explicit hailing or
interpellation]{.underline} of [her as an ethnic subject as
such]{.underline}, by playing along with the "mimetic enactment of the
automatized stereotypes that are dangled out there in public, hailing
the ethnic"32[---"\[they\] would still be considered a turncoat, this
time because \[they are\] too eagerly pandering to the orientalist
tastes of Westerners]{.underline}"33 and, this time, most likely by
other nonwhite ethnic subjects. Thus, the ethnic subject seems damned if
she does and damned if she doesn't "be" an ethnic subject. This
damnation, of course, comes from different parties and with different
implications. But Chow's point is that in contrast, "however far he
chooses to go, a white person sympathetic to or identifying with a
nonwhite culture does not in any way become less white."34 Indeed, she
claims, when it comes to nonwhite peoples doing exactly the same thing
... ---that is, becoming sympathetic to or identified with cultures
other than their own---we get a drastically different kind of
evaluation. If an ethnic critic should simply ignore her own ethnic
history and become immersed in white culture, she would, needless to
say, be deemed a turncoat (one that forgets her origins).35

overload]{.underline}]{.mark}** Freud shows **[[it utilizes to make its
argu-ment]{.underline}]{.mark}**\":\" the symptom functions like a
metaphor, desire like a metonymy, the narcissistic mechanisms of defense
and resistance employ all kinds of \"tropes\" and \"figures of
speech\"---periphrasis, ellipsis, denial, digression, irony, litotes,

a theory **[[of the rhetoric of the unconscious]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
\"On the basis of the manifestations of the unconscious with which I
deal as an analyst, I came to develop a theory of the effects of the
signifier through which I rejoin the preoccupations of rhetoric.\",4
Alongside this inquiry into rhetoric, there is in Lacan\'s work a second
project, focusing on grammar: \"Such are **[[the structural conditions
which determine---as grammar]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}** of en-croachments **[[constitutive of the
signifiers]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" The accomplishment of this double
project should thus establish a grammar of rhetoric. The logical
coherence of such a project may seem self-evident.

However, for a logician like Charles Sanders Peirce, the logical
affiliation between rhetoric and grammar cannot be taken for granted: in
fact, Peirce makes a distinction between \"pure rhet-oric\" and \"pure
grammar.\" What he calls **[[\"pure rhetoric\" is
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** well-known process by which one sign
engenders another: a **[[sys-tem of reference from sign to sign in which

**[[requiring]{.underline}]{.mark}** for its establishment the
intervention of a third element which Peirce calls **[[the
interpretant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"**[[Pure
grammar,\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the other hand, **[[postulates the
possibility of a continuous, binary relationship between sign and
meaning not requiring the interven-tion of a third
element]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In general, we think of
**[[grammar]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a logical system par excellence
and, as such, identical to itself, universal, and generative, that is,
inscribing the possibility of infinite com-binations and transformations
stemming from **[[a single, unified model without the intervention of

first.]{.underline}]{.mark}**16 By contrast, **[[rhetoric can be
perceived only through a discontinuity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** subverts or, at the very least,
**[[contradicts the logical continuity of the grammatical
model]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to
borrow out of context a Lacanian expression, always **[[has

have not]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet en-tirely **[[given up because of
their justified feeling that their conform-ism is of value only on the

### Death drive

#### Embracing the death drive is the only way to transcend the false repetition of desire drives and to allow one to enjoy true pleasures of life---a mode of engagement with the resolution is violent because it produces only a delusive contentment with the achievement of the aff---the void left by the *objet petit a* can never be filled.

[[The death drive]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite the implications of the
term itself and Freud's own suggestions in this direction, [is not a
drive to die and thereby return to an inorganic state]{.underline}.
[Rather than the death that occurs at the end of life, the death drive
comes out of a death that occurs within life.]{.underline} **[It [is a
drive to repeat the experience of the loss of the privileged object that
gives birth to the desiring subject]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This
experience is death in life insofar as [it marks the moment at which
death installs itself in the subject and rips the subject out of the
cycle of life]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The loss of the privileged object
derails the subject and distorts the subject's relationship to life
itself]{.mark}. From this moment on, **[rather than simply trying to
survive or to increase its vitality, the subject will continually return
to the loss that defi nes the structure of its
desire]{.mark}**]{.underline}.23 Th is disruption of life that founds
the subject as 36 Subjectivity such renders insuffi cient any recourse
to an organicist or biological explanation of subjectivity. Th e subject
of desire is never just a living subject; it is [[a
subject]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[holds within it a form of death, a
loss that shapes every relation that it subsequently adopts to the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, this loss pulls the subject out
of the world and leaves it completely alienated from its environment or
lifeworld. Because of the traumatic loss that founds subjectivity, the
subject never has a world. It does not exist as a being-in-the-world in
the way that Martin Heidegger describes. Heidegger, who rejects the idea
of subjectivity, considers our being in terms of what he calls Dasein,
or being-there. For Heidegger, Dasein is always a being-in-the-world and
is unimaginable outside its worldliness. We cannot speak of subjectivity
when talking about Dasein precisely because subjectivity implies a
separation between Dasein and its world. Dasein experiences alienation
from its world, but it remains fundamentally a part of that world: its
world is the limit that contains Dasein and that Dasein cannot go
beyond. But Heidegger assumes rather than deduces Dasein's worldliness
and its relationship to objects.24 In fact, Heidegger lampoons much of
the history of Western philosophy for casting doubt on the existence of
the external world and for suggesting that one might need to prove its
being. Dasein's world did not come into being through an act of sacrifi
ce; this world, according to Heidegger, is the horizon that accompanies
and constitutes Dasein's very existence. By privileging the foundational
experience of traumatic loss, Freud att empts to apprehend the birth of
this relationship between the subject and its world rather than taking
it for granted. He implies that one can't simply assume that a world in
which one can distinguish objects as distinct from oneself is given a
priori. [Rather than always experiencing a world, the subject as Freud
conceives it begins in the unworldly state of autoeroticism, where
distinctions do not exist. Without some act of negation --- the initial
sacrifi ce of nothing --- objects cannot emerge out of this undiff
erentiated existence.]{.underline} But even aft er this primordial
sacrifi ce, the subject does not att ain the worldliness that Heidegger
identifi es with Dasein's experience. [[Because it is born through the
act of loss, the subject never has]{.mark} --- and never can have --- [a
world.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It remains alienated and out of touch from
the world, relating to the world and the objects in the world through
the mediation of the lost object]{.underline}.]{.mark} Th e subject, in
other words, experiences the presence 37 of the world through the
absence of the privileged object. Th e empirical objects in the world
cannot but dissatisfy the subject insofar as they fail to be the object.
[[The lost object structures every relationship that the subject takes
up with the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Th e experience of traumatic
loss has such a hold on the subject --- the subject continually returns
to it, re-creates it --- because this experience itself engenders
desiring and the object of desiring]{.underline}. Th is foundational
experience provides insight into the otherwise inexplicable structure of
the celebrated fort/da game that Freud discusses in Beyond the Pleasure
Principle. Th e analysis of the fort/da game is not simply one example
of many concerning the pleasure principle going awry in the 1920 book.
It is rather the key philosophical moment in all of Freud's work. Th
rough the observation of the fort/da game, Freud recognizes the priority
of loss in human activity. As everyone acquainted even slightly with
Freud's work knows, he recounts watching his grandson play a game with a
reel on a string, a game that consists of throwing the reel so that it
disappears (while saying "fort" \[gone\]) and then pulling the reel back
(while saying "da" \[here\]). [What surprises]{.underline}
[Freud]{.underline} about the game [is that]{.underline} even though
"there is no doubt that greater pleasure was att ached to the second act
. . . the fi rst act, that of departure, was staged as a game in itself
and far more frequently than the episode in its entirety, with its
pleasurable ending."25 Th e quandary that this game presents for Freud
derives from its defi ance of the pleasure principle: repeating the
disappearance of the reel more oft en than its more pleasurable
reappearance doesn't make sense according to Freud's own theoretical
approach. Nonetheless, Freud tries at length to interpret the game in
terms of the pleasure principle. He posits, for instance, that his
grandson obtains a sense of pleasure from taking an active role in an
event that he initially endured passively (the departure of his
privileged object). Even though the actual departure of the object is
unpleasant, repeating it actively allows the grandson a sense of mastery
that pleases him. Th ough not fully satisfi ed with this explanation,
Freud leaves the discussion of the fort/da game without going further.
Because Freud arrests his analysis of the fort/da game just aft er
positing that the game provides his grandson with the pleasure of
mastery through symbolization, most commentators see this as Freud's fi
nal word on the game. But as he works through other phenomena that seem
to defy the pleasure principle like the fort/da game does, Freud
eventually posits a drive beyond the pleasure principle. Th e negative
therapeutic reaction, the resistance to the psychoanalytic cure,
convinces Freud that [repetition has a much stronger hold on subjects
than the quest for pleasure]{.underline}. It is in this light that one
must return to the fort/da game and reinterpret it (even though Freud
himself does not). [**[Pleasure is not the final word]{.mark}** on this
game; **[there is something more ---]{.mark}** the pull of enjoyment, or
what Freud calls **[the death drive]{.mark}**]{.underline}.26 Though it
seems completely counterintuitive, [the subject enjoys the disappearance
of its privileged object]{.underline}; [it enjoys not having it rather
than having it because this experience returns the subject to the
initial moment of loss where the subject comes closer to the privileged
object than at any other time]{.underline}.27 **[[Since the object does
not exist, one cannot recover it; one can only repeat the process
through which it is lost]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Th is fundamental link
between enjoyment and loss renders enjoyment diffi cult to
endure]{.underline}. **[[Th e subject inevitably suffers its
enjoyment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the example of the fort/da game
shows, pleasure serves as an alibi allowing us to endure our enjoyment.
Th is is what Freud is gett ing at when he claims in Beyond the Pleasure
Principle that "the pleasure principle seems actually to serve the death
instincts."28 Precisely because enjoyment traumatizes us with a return
to a foundational experience of loss, we seek the pleasure that
accompanies the presence of the object as a way of hiding this trauma
from ourselves. But this pleasure is also fundamentally deceptive; it
has a wholly imaginary status. Th at is to say, **[the [pleasure
accompanying the recovery of the lost object appears as the ultimate
pleasure when we anticipate it but diminishes exponentially when we
realize it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When we look at pleasure in this way,
Freud's grandson's lack of interest in the "pleasurable ending" of the
reel's return becomes easier to understand --- as does the consumer's
lack of interest in the commodities that she or he has already
purchased.29 We can also understand the appeal of tragedy as an art
form. If we think about art only in terms of the pleasure it provides,
the emergence of tragedy seems diffi cult to comprehend, though
Aristotle does manage to think of it in a way that approximates Freud's
pleasure principle. Th e pleasure principle necessitates that the
subject rid itself of excess excitation: pleasure comes not from
excitement but from a neutral state in which one lacks excitation. For
Aristotle, **[we are drawn to tragedy because it works "with incidents
arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such
emotions]{.underline}**."30 Th at is, **[tragedy allows us to rid
ourselves of the excessive emotions of pity and terror, and this process
accounts for the pleasure that tragedy provides]{.underline}**. But this
explanation seems to underestimate art's ability to augment our
emotional state, to leave us with more emotional excitation than before
having experienced the work of art. If the point of tragedy is the
release of powerful emotions, Aristotle can't explain why it fi rst must
augment these feelings in the spectator prior to facilitating their
release. Any explanation that thinks of art purely in terms of pleasure
will undoubtedly run into similar diffi culties when it comes to
tackling our desire for tragedy. Even if tragedy as an art form doesn't
off er us much in the way of pleasure, it does provide an opportunity
for us to enjoy. [While watching a tragedy, we enjoy the repetition of
the experience of loss]{.underline}. What's more, **[tragedy does not
simply depict a random loss. Th e loss it highlights is always in some
sense self-infl icted]{.underline}**. Oedipus blinds himself; Antigone
defi es Creon in order to make her death inevitable; Hamlet chooses to
confront Claudius even though he knows it will cost him his life; and so
on. Th e tragic hero is at once the agent responsible for the experience
of loss and the one who endures it. Even when tragic
[heroes]{.underline} are not initially responsible for their fall, like
Oedipus in Oedipus Tyrannus, they [assume responsibility, as if they had
willed it, which has the eff ect of transforming the externally infl
icted wound into a self-inflicted one]{.underline}.31 [Tragedy's focus
on the self-infl icted loss returns us as spectators to our own initial
loss of the privileged object --- the primordial self-inflicted
wound]{.underline}. **[The enjoyment that tragedy produces in the
spectator occurs through the repetition of sacrifice.]{.underline}**

#### The death drive is the only method of finding satisfaction and happiness in life 

**McGowan 2013**  \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television

The political dimension of psychoanalysis comes into better focus when
we understand it as an economic theory. Though Freud at times puts ideas
in economic terms, he doesn't make the economics of psychoanalytic
thought fully explicit. But economics is nonetheless present and
awaiting explication in the fundamental tenets of psychoanalysis.
[The]{.underline} [economics of psychoanalysis emphasize]{.underline},
in contrast to the economics of capitalism, [an ability to find
satisfaction in our drive rather than seeking the ultimate satisfaction
elsewhere]{.underline}. It is [an economics that renounces any form of
accumulation or attainment]{.underline}. [Finding satisfaction in our
drive frees us from the dissatisfaction associated with trying to comply
with social demands, whatever form they assume]{.underline}. Sometimes
[social authorities]{.underline} [demand]{.underline} that we obey or
conform, while at other times they demand that we consume or express our
individuality. In any case, such demands [and our adherence to them lead
inevitably to dissatisfaction]{.underline}. We try to acquire in this
way an object or a sense of recognition that is impossible to obtain.
What's more, [this pursuit leaves us dependent on the social authority
that issues the demands]{.underline}. In this way**[, the economic
structure of capitalism and the endless pursuit of accumulation that it
compels correspond with the subject's dependence on the power of social
authority]{.underline}**. [Psychoanalysis envisions a break from
accumulation and from dependence]{.underline}. [The political project of
psychoanalysis envisions a turn away from searching for the ultimate
satisfaction located elsewhere --- from accumulation --- and toward
enjoyment, a turn made possible by rethinking where our enjoyment lies.
According to psychoanalytic economics, enjoyment is located in what
disturbs us rather than in what we might obtain, and when we grasp this,
we change the nature of our political]{.underline}
[subjectivity]{.underline}. **[The obstacle to our enjoyment is at once
the source of our enjoyment, not what we must eliminate in order to
discover the ultimate satisfaction]{.underline}**. An idea of the
economics of the psyche underlies Freud's work throughout his career,
but it becomes most explicit in a very early work, the unfinished
Project for a Scientific Psychology of 1895.1 In this manuscript, Freud
att empts to account for psychic processes according to a completely
mechanical model, a model that marginalizes the eff ects of
consciousness almost completely. Th ough for many psychoanalytically
informed thinkers the physiological nature of Freud's theory at this
point severely restricts its pertinence for understanding the psyche,
one can translate Freud's physiological theory into a psychic one.2 In
the Project, Freud sees the psyche as a system designed to discharge
psychic energy that is transmitt ed through neurones. Energy bombards
the psyche from both inside and out --- through endogamous forces and
external stimuli. At this point in his thought, [Freud believes that the
aim of psychic life involves returning to a zero level of
excitation]{.underline}, an aim that he later aligns with the pleasure
principle. [By warding off excitation, the psychic processes free the
psyche from unpleasure and return it to a state of
satisfaction]{.underline}. Once Freud conceived of the death drive in
1920, his conception of satisfaction underwent a fundamental shift .
Whereas in the vision of the Project and his other pre-1920 work (which
views the psyche in terms of the pleasure principle) satisfaction is a
state that the psyche arrives at through the discharge of excitation,
aft er the discovery of the death drive in Beyond the Pleasure Principle
**[satisfaction will consist in the movement of the drive itself, not in
the aim that it attains]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, what remains
constant in these two different economic models is the absolute psychic
primacy of satisfaction. Th e psyche strives above all to sustain its
satisfaction, and it is successful at doing so. Satisfaction occurs in
the operations of the psyche because, as Freud sees it in 1895, the
discharge of excitation always occurs. Th ough there are infi nite diff
erences among individual subjects, we can say that all subjects are
satisfi ed subjects insofar as they partake in the process of
discharging 54 Subjectivity excitation. For every subject, this process
fi nds a way to occur successfully, even if it encounters a circuitous
path in the psyche. Individual diff erence manifests itself in diff
erent psychic paths, but not in the fundamental fact of discharging
excitation. [Th at is, what the psyche does is universal, but how the
psyche goes about doing this varies in each particular
case]{.underline}. The universality of what the psyche does allows Freud
to recognize that the economy of the psyche produces satisfaction for
every subject, even if the subject is unaware of its own satisfaction.
Th is remains true when Freud turns from the 1895 model of the psyche to
the later one centered on [the death drive]{.underline}, though in the
later theory satisfaction derives from the drive's constant force rather
than from a discharge of excitation. Th e drive [provides an inescapable
satisfaction by never letting up]{.underline}. When we think of therapy
of any kind, including psychoanalysis, we usually think of a trajectory
moving from dissatisfaction to some degree of satisfaction. Subjects
enter therapy with a psychic ailment causing dissatisfaction, and if the
treatment succeeds, they leave with the ability to lead a more
satisfying existence.3 If subjects didn't feel dissatisfaction, they
wouldn't enter into any therapy, and if they didn't att ain some
satisfaction as a result, therapy would cease to be a viable practice.
But despite its commonsensical appearance, this model does not apply to
psychoanalytic therapy --- or, rather, psychoanalysis is not therapy in
this sense. Rather than effectuate a qualitative change in the subject
by transforming dissatisfaction into satisfaction, psychoanalysis att
empts to intervene --- and finds the justification for its intervention
--- on a quantitative level. Rather than att empting to cure dissatisfi
ed subjects, psychoanalysis confronts subjects who are satisfi ed but
who spend too much psychic eff ort or who take a path that is too
circuitous for the satisfaction they obtain. In this sense,
psychoanalysis is fundamentally an economic theory of the psyche. [Th e
death drive and the repetition that it installs in the subject follow a
self-satisfying course.]{.underline} [Th e death drive fi nds a path to
satisfaction or enjoyment despite --- or because of --- whatever
obstacles the external world might erect.]{.underline} Th e satisfaction
of the subject is the one constant in psychoanalytic thought, and it
leads Freud to postulate the existence of the drive as the source of
that satisfaction.4 [Th e satisfaction that the death drive produces
stems from its circular structure: rather than trying to att ain
satisfaction through an external aim, the drive produces that
satisfaction through the process of the repeated movement
itself]{.underline}. Th e self-satisfi ed quality of the drive diff
erentiates it from physiological need: needs undergo fl uctuation from a
state of dissatisfaction to one of satisfaction when they achieve their
aim. Th e drive, on the other hand, never fl uctuates.5 Unlike
biological need (which might be satisfi ed or not, depending on whether
it discovers its object), [the drive (which has an absent object) always
involves satisfaction]{.underline}. Th us, psychoanalysis, a practice
oriented around the drive, cannot intervene by way of off ering a
missing satisfaction or providing a helping hand to those down on their
luck.6 Th e psychoanalytic intervention must be strictly economic, that
is, involving the quantity of psychic eff ort expended by the analysand.
Th e aim of the psychoanalyst --- [the analyst's desire]{.underline} ---
[must be to remove the detours that the analysand has placed along the
path of the drive in order to allow the analysand to take up completely
her or his position in the drive]{.underline}. In Seminar XI, Lacan lays
out the situation confronting the analyst: "What we have before us in
analysis is a system in which everything turns out all right, and which
att ains its own sort of satisfaction. If we interfere in this, it is
only in so far as we think that there are other ways, shorter ones for
example."7 In submitt ing to analysis, the analysand submits, albeit
unknowingly, to this desire for shortening or economizing the path of
the drive. Th is shortening is the analytic cure, and Freud fi rst comes
to understand it as such in the 1895 Project where he emphasizes the
costs of psychic detours that the subject erects to the fl ow of psychic
energy.

#### Embracing the death drive creates a new of subject formation which breaks free of the repetitive politics. 

**McGowan 2013** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television

In light of this barrier, [the formulation of a psychoanalytically
informed political project demands that we dissociate politics from
progress as it is usually conceived]{.underline}. We cannot escape
progress, and yet the traditional conception of progress always runs
aground. [Th is paradox must become the foundation of any authentic
psychoanalytic politics.]{.underline} It demands that rather than trying
to progress toward overcoming the barrier that separates us from the
good society, we begin to view identification with the barrier as the
paradoxical aim of progress. [The barrier to the good society --- the
social symptom --- is at once the obstacle over which we continually
stumble and the source of our enjoyment]{.underline}.32 [Th e typical
politics of the good aims at a future not inhibited by a limit that
constrains the present]{.underline}. Th is future can take the form of a
truly representative democracy, a socialist utopia, a society with a
fair distribution of power and wealth, or even a fascist order that
would expel those who embody the limit. But the good remains out of
reach despite the various eff orts to reach it. The limit separating us
from the good society is the very thing that constitutes the good
society as such. Overcoming the limit shatters the idea of the good in
the act of achieving it. In place of this pursuit, [a psychoanalytic
politics insists on identification with the limit rather than attempting
to move beyond or eliminate it]{.underline}. [If there is a conception
of progress in this type of politics, it is progress toward the obstacle
that bars us from the good rather than toward the good
itself]{.underline}. Identification with the limit involves an embrace
of the repetition of the drive because it is the obstacle or limit that
is the point to which the drive returns. No one can be the perfect
subject of the drive because the drive is what undermines all
perfection. But it is nonetheless possible to change one's experience
within it. Th e fundamental wager of psychoanalysis --- a wager that
renders the idea of a psychoanalytic political project thinkable --- is
that repetition undergoes a radical transformation when one adopts a
different attitude toward it. We may be condemned to repeat, but we
aren't condemned to repeat the same position relative to our repetition.
[By embracing repetition through identifi cation with the obstacle to
progress rather than trying to achieve the good by overcoming this
obstacle, the subject or the social order changes its very
nature]{.underline}. Instead of being the burden that one seeks to
escape, [repetition becomes the essence of one's being and the mode
through which one att ains satisfaction]{.underline}. [Conceiving
politics in terms of the embrace of repetition rather than the
construction of a good society takes the movement that derails
traditional political projects and reverses its valence]{.underline}. Th
is idea of politics lacks the hopefulness that Marxism, for instance,
can provide for overcoming antagonism and loss. With it, we lose not
just a utopian ideal but the idea of an alternative future altogether
--- the idea of a future no longer beset by intransigent limits --- and
this idea undoubtedly mobilizes much political energy.33 What we gain,
however, is a political form that addresses the way that subjects
structure their enjoyment. **[It is by abandoning the terrain of the
good and adopting the death drive as its guiding principle that
emancipatory politics can pose a genuine alternative]{.underline}** to
the dominance of global capitalism rather than incidentally creating new
avenues for its expansion and development. Th e death drive is the
revolutionary contribution that psychoanalysis makes to political
thought. But since it is a concept relatively foreign to political
thought, I will turn to various examples from history, literature, and
fi lm in order to concretize what Freud means by the death drive and
illustrate just what a politics of the death drive might look like. Th e
chapters that follow trace the implications of the death drive for
thinking about the subject as a political entity and for conceiving the
political structure of society. Part 1 focuses on the individual
subject, beginning with an explanation of how the death drive shapes
this subjectivity. Th e various chapters in part 1 trace the
implications of the death drive for understanding how the subject
enjoys, how the drive relates to social class, how the drive impacts the
subject as an ethical being, and how the subject becomes politicized. Th
e discussion of the impact of the death drive on the individual subject
serves as a foundation for articulating its impact on society, which
part 2 of the book addresses, beginning with the impact of the death
drive on the constitution of society. Part 2 then examines how the
conception of the death drive helps in navigating a path through today's
major political problems: the ineffi cacity of consciousness raising,
the seductive power of fantasy, the growing danger of biological
reductionism and fundamentalism, the lure of religious belief, and the
failure of att empts to lift repression. Th e two parts of the book do
not att empt to sketch a political goal to be att ained for the subject
or for society but instead to recognize the structures that already
exist and silently inform both. Th e wager of what follows is that the
revelation of the death drive and its reach into the subject and the
social order can be the foundation for reconceiving freedom. Th e
recognition of the death drive as foundational for subjectivity is what
occurs with the psychoanalytic cure. [Th rough this cure, the subject
abandons the belief in the possibility of fi nding a solution to the
problem of subjectivity]{.underline}. Th e loss for which one seeks
restitution becomes a constitutive loss --- and becomes visible as the
key to one's enjoyment rather than a barrier to it. A political project
derived from psychoanalytic thought would work to broaden this cure by
bringing it outside the clinic and enacting on society itself. Th e
point is not, of course, that everyone would undergo psychoanalysis but
that psychoanalytic theory would function as a political theory.
Politically, the importance of psychoanalysis is theoretical rather than
practical. Politically, it doesn't matt er whether people undergo
psychoanalytic therapy or not. Th is theory would inaugurate political
change by insisting not on the possibility of healing and thereby att
aining the ultimate pleasure but on the indissoluble link between our
enjoyment and loss. [We become free to enjoy only when we have
recognized the intractable nature of loss]{.underline}. Th ough
psychoanalytic thought insists on our freedom to enjoy, it understands
freedom in a counterintuitive way. It is through [the death drive that
the subject att ains its freedom]{.underline}. Th e loss that founds
this drive frees the subject from its dependence on its social
environment, and the repetition of the initial loss sustains this
freedom. By embracing the inescapability of traumatic loss, one embraces
one's freedom, and any political project genuinely concerned with
freedom must orient itself around loss. [Rather than looking to the
possibility of overcoming loss, our political projects must work to
remain faithful to it and enhance our contact with it. Only in this way
does politics have the opportunity to carve out a space for the freedom
to enjoy rather than restricting it under the banner of the
good]{.underline}.

#### The alt creates conditions of change which break subject passivity. When subjects engage in acts purely for enjoyment, the incoherence of the social order is uncovered and spillover into change occurs.

As long as Hamlet hopes that his act might accomplish something
substantial, the moment will never be right for it. Once he ceases to
believe in the possibility of restoring justice and understands the act
only in terms of his own fantasmatic enjoyment, he frees himself from
the search for the proper moment. [Subjects who hope to make an impact
on social authority never act because they cannot calculate how the
authority will respond to the act]{.underline}. [Such
subjects]{.underline}, like Hamlet at the beginning of the play, [spend
their time probing the authority's desire and waiting for the moment
when the act will make the proper impact on the other]{.underline}. [But
that moment never comes. When one adopts the position of the fool, the
moment for the act is always at hand because the fool's act has nothing
to do with the readiness of the social authority for it.]{.underline}
There is a danger in advocating the subjectivity of the fool, however.
Many adopt the position of the fool as a symbolic identity that provides
meaning for their lives. Such subjects perversely act out rather than
accomplishing genuinely successful acts. The difference consists in how
the subject relates to the position of the fool. The perverse fool acts
in order to provoke the social authority into a response, while the
genuine fool acts for the sake of its own enjoyment regardless of the
authority's response. The former derives a sense of identity from the
position; the latter does not. The difference between the perverse
subject and the authentic fool is visible within the character of
Hamlet. After he first hears of his father's murder at the beginning of
the play, Hamlet feigns madness; he literally plays the part of the
fool. But he takes up this position in order to provoke authority, not
in order to realize his own enjoyment. Hamlet uses his madness in an
attempt to trigger a reaction in Claudius that will offer definitive
proof of the latter's guilt. But even when Claudius reacts in the way
that Hamlet wants to the performance of the provocative play that Hamlet
has produced, Hamlet still does not act but continues to act out. It is
only well after the play ends, after he has realized the absence of any
order in the world or any guarantee for his action in social authority,
that Hamlet is able to act. When he acts, he acts not on the basis of
laws or justice but on the basis of his own fantasy frame. In act 5 he
becomes the authentic fool, one no longer playing to the crowd but
determined to follow his fantasy regardless of authority's response. In
so doing, he provides a model for successful subjectivity, for how the
subject might act to change the world.36 Publicly insisting on one's
fantasy hardly seems like a prescription for changing the world in any
substantive fashion. If this is the political attitude advanced by
psychoanalysis, the indictment of psychoanalysis on political grounds
appears to have a great deal of merit. But this would be to move too
quickly. We might think of the relationship between embracing one's own
fantasy and politics as a twisted version of the line from the Talmud
that characters repeat in *Schindler's List* (Steven Spielberg, 1993):
"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." Translated into our
terms this would become: "Whoever publicly insists on her or his own
fantasy opens this path for the world entire." By doing this, the
subject institutes a fundamental change in the structure of its symbolic
world. [When one subject opts for the nonsense of its own enjoyment over
the blandishments of recognition, this act exposes the groundlessness of
social authority --- the emptiness around which the social order is
structured]{.underline}. [A collective awareness of the groundlessness
of social authority would produce a different sort of social order, one
in which subjects would be unable to rely on authority and would have to
assume responsibility themselves for the social order]{.underline}. They
would lose the sense of authorization for their acts. [The freedom
inherent in social existence would become evident in light of
authority's evanescence]{.underline}.

#### Emancipatory politics can only be successful through psychoanalysis.

Perhaps the most important political problem of the last century
concerns lifting repression. Even more than the obstacle of religious
belief, repression represents a rigid barrier that has often been the
focus of emancipatory politics. But as the history especially of the
last half of the twentieth century has shown, [lifting repression
doesn't necessarily lead to political liberation.]{.underline}
[It]{.underline} can even, as the main thesis of the Frankfurt School
[has]{.underline} it, [become the vehicle for further decreasing the
freedom of the subject in the face of ideological control]{.underline}.
[As societies eliminate varieties of repression, some fundamental
deadlock remains recalcitrant and stands as a political stumbling
block.1]{.underline} If the political project of lifting repression
inevitably goes awry, then this confronts the project of emancipation
with the question of what it can do. This is where the intervention of
psychoanalytic thought makes itself felt. Psychoanalysis has
historically functioned as a tool for the struggle against repression,
but if the attempt to fight repression inevitably fails or even
backfires, the engagement of psychoanalytic thought with politics today
requires a new attitude. The key to the political project of
psychoanalysis lies in the unexpected twist that it gives to the fight
against repression. According to this project, [one must reenvision the
deadlock that limits the political project of lifting
repression]{.underline}. [Rather than seeing the deadlock that projects
for emancipation encounter as purely a stumbling block to be negotiated,
one might embrace the deadlock as itself a political
position]{.underline}. A properly psychoanalytic politics would
transform it from an obstacle into a point of identification. [By
identifying with the symbolic deadlock that impedes liberation, one can
transform the cause of past political failures into a source of
success]{.underline}. But the cost of this transformation is a
redefinition of success as clarifying and embracing a limit rather than
transcending it. The ultimate [contribution of psychoanalytic thought to
politics is its ability to provide a basis for an emancipatory politics
of the limit]{.underline}.2

The politics of the death drive begins with the revolutionary idea of
subjectivity that Freud uncovers: his understanding that [the subject
doesn't seek knowledge but instead desires]{.underline}. Following from
this idea, the traditional notion of progress becomes untenable, and the
subject becomes self-destructive. On the one hand, earlier thinkers like
Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche anticipate Freud's
revolutionary turn from the subject of knowledge to the subject of
desire. Schopenhauer and Nietzsche emphasize how our quest for knowledge
serves as a guise for a more fundamental quest for satisfaction, and in
this way they overturn the traditional philosophical conception of
subjectivity.1 But on the other hand, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche
fail to grasp the significance of the human animal's entrance into the
field of knowledge or language. For both, will exists on one side and
knowledge (or representation) on the other, and will is nothing but a
biological fact. Freud's conception of desiring subjectivity recognizes
that the subject is the result of instinct being deformed through its
submission to the realm of knowledge. Though we act on behalf of desire
rather than knowledge, we do so, paradoxically, because our instincts
are mediated by knowledge. Freud's subject, in contrast to
Schopenhauer's and Nietzsche's, never experiences pure biological
instincts but rather a desire that remains unconscious.2 Authentically
prioritizing desire requires an idea of the unconscious not simply as
the site of a will or instinct associated with human animality but as a
radically different psychic scene fundamentally irreducible to
consciousness. 26 Subjectivity For Freud, the subject doesn't know its
unconscious desire not because of its failure to grasp its continued
animality but because unconscious desire gives birth to the subject and
always remains in front of every project of knowledge. Freud's
revolution is a genuine one --- tied to a unique vision of how
subjectivity emerges.3 The political implications of psychoanalytic
thought begin with its understanding of the genesis of subjectivity, an
understanding that sets psychoanalysis apart from other political
theorizing of all stripes. [[The foundational status of
loss]{.underline}]{.mark} for the subject [entails a politics centered
around]{.underline} the [repetition]{.underline} of loss [rather than
the achievement of the good]{.underline}. Psychoanalytic thought sees us
as condemned to the repetition of loss, but it aims at freeing us to
take up a new relation to this repetition. [This new relation [is the
emancipatory project of psychoanalytic politics]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Initially, as Freud conceives it, the human animal is an autoerotic
being that has no object world. The distinction between self and other
(or subject and object) is not a fact of birth but a psychical
achievement. The infant's autoerotic mode does not yet differentiate
between itself and objects, and the being finds some degree of
satisfaction in its undifferentiated existence. This autoeroticism is
not yet even narcissism. The narcissistic relationship of the subject
with its own ego requires the formation of an ego, which can only form
through a break in the autoerotic circuit. As Freud puts it in "On
Narcissism: An Introduction," "A unity comparable to the ego cannot
exist in the individual from the start; the ego has to be developed. Th
e auto-erotic instincts, however, are there from the very first; so
there must be something added to auto-eroticism --- a new psychical
action --- in order to bring about narcissism."4 Because the ego is just
a special sort of object (one that competes with other objects for the
subject's libido), it can form and the subject can become narcissistic
only after the subject has created the division between subject and
object. This creative act --- what Freud calls "a new psychical action"
--- produces a division out of the undifferentiated autoeroticism of the
human animal. [The subject]{.underline} as such [emerges through the
experience of loss]{.underline}. It is the loss of a part of the subject
--- [an initial act of sacrifice]{.underline} --- that [creates both
subject and object, the object emerging through this act as what the
subject has lost of itself]{.underline}. The subject takes an interest
in the object world because it forms this world around its lost object.
As Jacques Lacan notes, "Never, in our concrete experience of analytic
theory, do we do without the notion of 27 The Formation of Subjectivity
the lack of the object as central. It is not a negative, but the very
spring for the relation of the subject to the world."5 The loss of the
object generates a world around this loss to which the subject can
relate. Obviously, no one literally creates objects through an initial
act of sacrifice of an actual body part. This would be too much to ask.
But the psychical act of sacrifice allows for a distinction to develop
where none existed before and simultaneously directs the subject's
desire toward the object world. In his breakthrough essay "Negation,"
Freud describes this process as follows: "Th e antithesis between
subjective and objective does not exist from the fi rst. It only comes
into being from the fact that thinking possesses the capacity to bring
before the mind once more something that has once been perceived, by
reproducing it as a presentation without the external object having
still to be there. The first and immediate aim, therefore, of
reality-testing is, not to fi nd an object in real perception which
corresponds to the one presented, but to refind such an object, to
convince oneself that it is still there."6 Though Freud doesn't use
terms from linguistics, it is clear that he is making reference to the
subject's alienation in language and that he sees this alienation as the
key to the emergence of both the subject and the object. When the
subject submits to the imperatives of language, it enters into an
indirect relation with the object world. [The speaking being does not
relate to books, pencils, and paper but to "books," "pencils," and
"paper." The signifier intervenes]{.underline} between the subject and
the object that the subject perceives. [The subject's alienation into
language deprives it of immediate contact with the object
world]{.underline}. And yet, in the above passage from "Negation," Freud
conceives of the subject's entrance into language --- its "capacity to
bring before the mind once more something that has once been perceived,
by reproducing it as a presentation without the external object having
still to be there" --- as the event that produces the very distinction
between subject and object. Th is means that the indirectness or
mediation introduced by language deprives the subject of a direct
relation to the object world that it never had. Prior to its immersion
in the mediation of language, the subject had no object at all --- not a
privileged relation to objects but a complete absence of relationality
as such due to its autoeroticism. In this sense, the subject's
willingness to accede to its alienation in language is the fi rst
creative act, a sacrifi ce that produces the objects that the subject
cannot directly access. Language is important not for its own sake but
because it is the site of our 28 Subjectivity founding sacrifi ce. We
know that the subject has performed this act of sacrifice when we
witness the subject functioning as a being of language, but the sacrifi
ce is not an act that the subject takes up on its own. Others always
impose the entry into language on the subject. Th eir exhortations and
incentives to speak prompt the emergence of the speaking subject. But
the subject's openness to alienation in language, its willingness to
sacrifi ce a part of itself in order to become a speaking subject,
suggests a lack in being itself prior to the entry into language. Th at
is, the act through which the subject cedes the privileged object and
becomes a subject coincides with language but is irreducible to it. The
subject engages in the act of sacrifi ce because it does not fi nd its
initial autoeroticism perfectly satisfying --- the unity of the
autoerotic being is not perfect --- and this lack of complete
satisfaction produces the opening through which language and society
grab onto the subject through its alienating process. If the initial
autoerotic state of the human animal were perfectly satisfying, no one
would begin to speak, and subjectivity would never form. Speaking as
such testifi es to an initial wound in our animal being and in being
itself. But subjectivity emerges only out of a self-wounding. Even
though others encourage the infant to abandon its autoerotic state
through a multitude of inducements, the initial loss that constitutes
subjectivity is always and necessarily self-infl icted. Subjectivity has
a fundamentally masochistic form, and it continually repeats the
masochistic act that founds it. Th e act of sacrifi ce opens the door to
the promise of a satisfaction that autoerotic isolation forecloses,
which is why the incipient subject abandons the autoerotic state and
accedes to the call of sociality. But the term "sacrifi ce" is
misleading insofar as it suggests that the subject has given up a
wholeness (with itself or with its parent) that exists prior to being
lost. In the act of sacrifi ce, [the incipient subject gives up
something that it doesn't have]{.underline}. Th e initial loss that
founds subjectivity is not at all substantial; it is the ceding of
nothing. Th rough this defi ning gesture, the subject sacrifi ces its
lost object into being. But if the subject cedes nothing, this initial
act of sacrifi ce seems profoundly unnecessary. Why can't the subject
emerge without it? Why is the experience of loss necessary for the
subject to constitute itself qua subject? Th e answer lies in the diff
erence between need and desire. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[needs]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the human animal [[are not dependent
on]{.mark} the experience of [loss]{.mark}]{.underline}, the subject's
[[**desires** are]{.underline}]{.mark}. 29 The Formation of Subjectivity
It is the initial act of sacrifice that gives birth to desire: the
subject sacrifi ces nothing in order to create a lost object around
which it can organize its desire. As Richard Boothby puts it in his
unequaled explanation of the psychoanalytic conception of the emergence
of desire, "Th e destruction and loss of the object . . . opens up a
symbolic dimension in which what was lost might be recovered in a new
form."7 He adds: "Sacrifi ce serves to constitute the very matrix of
desire. Th e essential function of sacrifi ce is less do ut des, I give
so that you might give, than do ut desidero: I give in order that I
might desire."8 Th e subject's desire is oriented around this lost
object, [but [the object]{.mark}]{.underline} is nothing as a positive
entity and [[only exists insofar as it is lost]{.mark}. This is why one
can never attain the]{.underline} lost [object]{.underline} or the
object that causes one to desire.9 Th e coming-into-being of this object
originates the subject of desire, but, having no substance, the object
can never become an empirical object of desire. We may see an object of
desire as embodying the lost object, but whenever we obtain this object,
we discover its emptiness. Th e lost object is constitutively rather
than empirically lost. Eating Nothing In this light, we can see the
anorexic as the model for all desiring subjectivity. Most cultural
critics justifi ably see anorexia as the product of oppressive defi
nitions of femininity that abound in contemporary society and force
women to starve themselves in order to fi t the ideals of feminine
beauty. According to Naomi Wolf 's classic popular account in Th e
Beauty Myth, the ideal of thinness became a way of controlling women ---
disciplining their bodies --- aft er the idea of natural female
inferiority began to evanesce.10 Th e anorexic embodies female
victimization: she has internalized a patriarchal ideal and does
violence to her own body in order to live up to this ideal. But the
problem with this analysis is that [the anorexic]{.underline} doesn't
just try to embody the ideal of feminine beauty.11 She [goes too
far]{.underline} in her pursuit of thinness and comes to inhabit a body
far from the ideal. Even when everyone tells her that she no longer
looks good, that she is too thin, the anorexic continues to lose weight.
[It is for this reason that many feminists have seen her as a subversive
figure]{.underline}. As Elizabeth Grosz puts it, "Neither a 'disorder'
of the ego nor, as popular opinion has it, a 'dieting disease' gone out
of control, anorexia can, like the phantom limb, be a kind of mourning
30 Subjectivity for a pre-Oedipal (i.e., pre-castrated) body and a
corporeal connection to the mother that women in patriarchy are required
to abandon. Anorexia is a form of protest at the social meaning of the
female body."12 Grosz accounts for the excessiveness of anorexia by
aligning it with feminist resistance to patriarchy rather than
obsequious submission to it. But she aligns the anorexic with wholeness
and the maternal bond rather than with the lost object. In this sense,
she misses [the true radicality of the anorexic]{.underline}, a
radicality that [stems from the power of the anorexic's desire. [The
anorexic doesn't simply refuse to eat but eats nothing]{.mark}, the
nothing that is [the lost object]{.mark}]{.underline}. While all
positive forms of food fail to address the subject's lack, nothing does
speak to the subject's desire and allows that desire to sustain itself.
Th e anorexic starves not because she can't fi nd, in the mode of Kafk
a's hunger artist, any food that would satisfy her but because she has
found a satisfying food, a food that nourishes the desiring subject
rather than the living being. [[The logic of anorexia lays bare the
hidden workings of desire that operate within every subject]{.mark}.
Subjects believe that they pursue various objects of desire]{.underline}
(a new car, a new house, a new romantic partner, and so on) and that
these objects have an intrinsic attraction, [but [the real engine
for]{.mark} their [desire resides in the nothing that the subject has
given up]{.mark} and that every object tries and fails to represent.
[Objects]{.mark} of desire [are desirable only insofar as they attempt
to represent the impossible lost object]{.mark}, which is what the
anorexic reveals]{.underline}. Still, the anorexic is exceptional; most
nonanorexic subjects imagine that their lost object can be found in
something rather than nothing. Despite its resonances with the structure
of desire, anorexia cannot be dissociated from the imposition of the
ideal of thinness as a mode of controlling female subjectivity. Th ough
this ideal distorts the anorexic's relationship to her own body, it also
renders the nature of desire itself apparent. Th e impossible ideal of
perfect thinness allows the anorexic subject to avow, albeit
unconsciously, the structural impossibility of desire itself. Unlike
male subjects (or other female subjects who manage to distance
themselves from the ideal), the anorexic cannot avoid confronting the
impossibility of her object. Th e oppressive ideal of perfect thinness
allows the anorexic to bear witness with her body to the truth of
desire.13 Understanding the impossible nature of the lost object ---
what the anorexic makes clear --- allows us to rethink the nature of the
political act. [Rather than being the successful achievement
of]{.underline} some object, the accomplishment of [some social good,
[the political act involves insisting on one's desire in the face of its
impossibility, which is precisely what occurs in the death
drive]{.mark}]{.underline}. The key to a politics of the death drive is
grasping, in the fashion of the anorexic, the nothingness of the object
and thereby finding satisfaction in the drive itself. But the subject's
relationship to its object inherently creates an illusion that makes
this possibility almost impossible. Though the lost object that
initiates subjectivity has no substance, its status for the subject
belies its nothingness. For the subject, the originary lost object is
the object that seems to hold the key to the subject's very ability to
enjoy. Subjects invest the lost object with the idea of their own
completion: the loss of the object retroactively causes a prior state of
completion to arise --- a state of completion that never actually
existed --- and the object itself bears the promise of inaugurating a
return to this imaginary prior state.14 In short, it promises to fill in
the subject's lack and answer its desire. As a result of this investment
on the part of the subject, the initial lost object becomes the engine
for all the subject's subsequent desiring. Without the initial act of
sacrifice, the would-be subject neither desires nor enjoys but instead
suffocates in a world of self-presence, a self-presence in which one has
no freedom whatsoever. [[Through the loss of the privileged object, one
frees oneself]{.mark} from the complete domination of]{.underline}
(parental or social) [authority [by creating a lack that no authority
can fill]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ceding the object is thus the founding
act of subjectivity and the fi rst free act. Every subsequent effort by
authority to give the subject what it lacks will come up short --- or,
more correctly, will go too far, because only nothing can fill the gap
within the subject. For this reason, [[dissatisfaction and
disappointment are correlative with freedom: when we experience the
authority's failure to give us what we want, at that moment we also
experience our distance from the authority and our radical freedom as
subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The great challenge that psychoanalysis poses for
emancipatory]{.underline} [politics]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and for
politics as such --- [[is its **absolute rejection** of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} good or the [[good
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the opening of the Politics, Aristotle
describes the good as the basic aim of political activity, and this aim
has remained constant in the intervening 2,500 years.7 Aristotle never
att empts to prove this constitutive remark in his treatise but simply
takes it as an unassailable postulate of political thinking. For
subsequent political thinkers, the question does not concern Aristotle's
claim about the good but in what the good consists. Th ere is unanimity
about the political pursuit of the good not just among political
theorists but among almost everyone who thinks about politics at all.
From the perspective of psychoanalysis, however, there is no good at
all. [[The good society is unattainable]{.underline}]{.mark} not just as
a result of the competing desires of the individuals within the society.
Th e theory that aligns social confl ict with the coexistence of
competing individual desires fails to go far enough in envisioning the
antagonistic nature of the social order. No matt er how divergent
individual desires are, one could always imagine reconciling them with
each other through some sort of compromise. A thinker such as John Rawls
can imagine a just society despite positing a society divided by
innumerable competing desires on the level of the individual. Justice
here would consist in the idea of fairness --- using one's imagination
to envision society through what Rawls labels a "veil of ignorance" that
allows one to make decisions about justice without taking into account
one's individual interests or desires or social position.8 Th is would
facilitate a good society in which any inequality would be socially
justifi ed, and it would thus reconcile competing individual desire But
the barrier to the good society runs deeper than this. It derives from
the very idea of the good, which Freud sees as fundamentally at odds
with itself. [[The good itself, not our failures to achieve it, is the
problem.]{.mark} [This is the fundamental political insight that
psychoanalysis brings]{.mark} to the table. It is at once the challenge
that it poses to emancipatory politics [and the basis for its]{.mark}
implicit **[project for emancipation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As we get
closer to the ideal of a good society, we simultaneously approach the
emptiness concealed within the ideal. Th e notion of the good does not
emerge simply from moral reasoning and speculation about the proper
arrangement of society. We develop this notion only through the
experience of its prohibition. Th at is to say, the prohibition of the
good doesn't form an obstacle to a preexisting ideal but constitutes the
ideal as such. Th e good has no existence outside of the barriers that
we erect around realizing it. As Jacques Lacan points out in one of his
most important political statements, "Th e step taken by Freud at the
level of the pleasure principle is to show us that there is no Sovereign
Good --- that the Sovereign Good, which is das Ding, which is the
mother, is also the object of incest, is a forbidden good, and that
there is no other good. Such is the foundation of the moral law as
turned on its head by Freud."9 Th e foundational link between the good
and prohibition renders its pursuit completely contradictory. [[Every
step toward the good occasions a]{.mark} corresponding [step
away]{.mark} from it. [The closer we come, the more we undermine the
social stability]{.mark} that [we hoped to achieve]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Th is occurs not just among the many utopian socialist projects that
have failed but across all types of social structures. For
psychoanalysis, the good is not just an unrealizable ideal but a
deception incapable of orienting a coherent and sustainable politics.
[This critique threatens to undermine the very idea of a political
project]{.underline} because political theorists write in order to help
bring about change, which means moving society in the direction of the
good (even if they admit that the ideal itself is not realizable).
Conservative theorists seem immune to this critique, but they envision a
return to the good or the creation of a social stability that they
associate implicitly with the good.10 Political theorists of all stripes
write to change the world and assist its progression (or its return to a
better state), whereas psychoanalysis interprets the world and uncovers
the repetition at work where it seems to be progressing. For this
reason, Julia [[Kristeva theorizes the political project inherent in
psychoanalysis as]{.mark} one of **[permanent revolt]{.mark}**. [Rather
than forming a positive program, psychoanalysis]{.mark},]{.underline}
like modernist literature, [[exists]{.mark} simply [as a negation of
identity and power]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Th e Sense and Non-sense of
Revolt, she argues, "psychoanalysis, on the one hand, and a certain
literature, on the other, perhaps constitute possible instances of
revolt culture."11 From Kristeva's point of view,
[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark} is completely political insofar as
it [[demands revolt, but]{.mark}]{.underline} this **[[revolt can never
become revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Psychoanalytic revolt is
destined to remain revolt against some existing power structure toward
which it will continue to provide resistance. Kristeva views
psychoanalytic thought as a hiccup in the hegemony of scientifi c
rationality and progress. [[**Any attempt** to create a positive
psychoanalytic politics would obviate its role]{.mark} as a key part of
revolt culture]{.underline}.

**This negation exploits the politics of stupidity---an unreadable
demand for nothing creates a site for love and solidarity without
reproducing our desire for recognition by the Master**

**WELTY 2018** (William, PhD Candidate at Rutgers, TOWARDS A POLITICS OF
STUPIDITY, Politics/Letters, May 30,
http://politicsslashletters.org/features/towards-politics-stupidity/)

One of the main issues with the late 20th century model of critique is
its limitation to conceiving of power as prohibition or
proliferation.\[4\] [One of Lacan's major insights was to
recognize]{.underline} this type of [power]{.underline} relation [at
work]{.underline} not just in the discourse about sex or politics, as in
Foucault, but [in [academic]{.mark}]{.underline}, knowledge-based
[[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} in general. Lacan describes such
relations in his Discourse of the University, updating the Hegelian
Master/Slave dialectic to one of Master/Student and demonstrating how
resistance often merely creates new force fields of power. In his
seminar following the 1968 protests in Paris, Lacan admonishes the
student protesters, many of whom were likely in the audience: "As
hysterics, you demand a new master. You will get it!"\[5\] The hysteric
provides an apt starting point for a critique of political protest as a
direct confrontation between protester and power, and uncoincidentally,
is the epithet often hurled at the Left from the Right.\[6\] On one
hand, the hysteric is an unreadable and resistant figure, repulsed by
power (sexual, or otherwise) and fighting hard against it. But
simultaneously, the hysteric desires that the repressive power desires
him/her back. Thus, [in the very act of resistance, this subversive
desire [still desires "a new master]{.mark},"]{.underline} as Lacan
articulately points out. [Isn't this the precise critique made by Angela
Peoples]{.underline} in her now infamous sign at the 2017 Women's March:
"[[Don't forget: White Women voted for Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}"?\[7\]

On her sign, [Peoples]{.underline} invokes a return of the repressed
that combines the legacy of psychoanalysis with the activism of
intersectional feminism. And, she [provides a more nuanced reading of
the situation than Lacan on his own]{.underline} would be capable.
Lacan, or at least Žižek's reading of him, anticipates and critiques a
Foucauldian reading of power: "[What one should avoid]{.underline} here
[is the Foucauldian misreading: the produced subject is not simply the
subjectivity which arises as the result of the disciplinary application
of knowledge-power, but its remainder, that which eludes the grasp of
knowledge-power]{.underline}."\[8\] These two opposed subjectivities map
onto the disagreements over feminism embodied in Peoples' sign: [on one
hand, subjects produced as a result of power, and on the other, those
produced yet excluded as its powerless outside. Subjectivity as
remainder]{.underline}, that which is left over after the productions of
power, is a crucial turn in understanding resistance to power. It
[provides a potential model for resistance that doesn't fall into the
trap of conceiving of power as either purely repressive or productive.
Peoples' resistance]{.underline}, in turn, [avoids a complicit form of
feminism while simultaneously avoiding]{.underline} the apocalyptic
thinking of [a knowledge-based masculine perspective]{.underline}.\[9\]
While this leftover part of subjectivity aligns nicely with what Lacan
calls objet petit a, I want to highlight the farcical aspect of being
out of place, which isn't totally absent from Peoples' posture in the
photo. The dark humor of not fitting in and being unreadable can be
described by what Patricia Gherovici and Manya Steinkole have called
"the new LOL" ( Lacan on Laughter).\[10\]

For Lacan, stupidity can create a movement from discourses of mastery,
like the University, to a state that lacks a lack and is characterized
by enjoyment. He says in Seminar XX, "Knowledge is worth just as much as
it costs \[coute\], a pretty penny \[beau-coute\], in that it takes
elbow-grease, and that it's difficult. Difficult to what? Less to
acquire it than to enjoy it."\[11\] In a capitalist knowledge discourse
based on acquisition, knowledge is easy enough to have; you can just buy
it, or if worst comes to worst, simply make it up. In the "post-truth"
economy, consumers will just acquire whatever knowledge fits their
worldview, whether it is made up or not. However, Lacan's economy is
strictly a non-capitalist one, since knowledge is reduced to exchange
value without surplus-value or profit.\[12\] But what does it mean that
it's difficult to enjoy? Lacan doesn't mean that knowledge, whether real
or alternative facts, can lead to happiness; surely the opposite is
often true, despite how many derive a sort of vulgar enjoyment from the
absurdly made-up tweets and alternative facts coming from the Right. But
to enjoy (jouir) is not about acquisition, and not about not acquiring,
but something "difficult" indeed: to relate to knowledge and the Other
in a way that frustrates such a lack-based economy as such. Stupidity
then is not about having or lacking knowledge (as in ignorance), but
rather learning how to enjoy. Such a difficult enjoyment leads us
through Lacan back to Freud; as Leo Bersani has shown, enjoyment in
Freud is both about having and not having pleasure.\[13\] And since
"jouir" also means "to orgasm" in French, Bersani likewise helps to show
how Freud's notion of drive is both pleasure and unpleasure: as
pleasure, it is something to be acquired, but as unpleasure, it is
something to be dispelled, through orgasm. What a politics of stupidity
forces us to attempt to think is a "knowledge" that, to make a bad pun
on Lacan's jouissance and Derrida's notion of politics, is "to come":
never final, never enjoyed too much, and always in tension.\[14\] Such a
tension aligns stupidity not with the lack of ignorance, but rather with
the almost unbearable presence of the Real.

But now it seems, like the movements of jouissance or the logic of a bad
joke, that we've just gone in a circle. Wasn't stupidity the problem
that led to Trump? Isn't such a politics of stupidity the very opposite
of resistance? Doesn't it run the risk of supporting and propping up the
workings of power, just like Foucault's "repressive hypothesis?" Is it
possible to critique knowledge based discourses while simultaneously
acknowledging those that historically have been marginalized from them?
Instead of mistakenly thinking of speaking out as subversion, perhaps
this thought experiment mistakenly thinks of humor, joking, and
stupidity as subversion. In order to address these concerns, we now turn
to a different trickster, and a non-French one at that: Ishmael Reed.

Ishmael Reed isn't afraid of stupidity, either as an aesthetic or as
subject matter. In fact, he often turns specifically to joking,
clowning, circuses, and stupidity, with his work ranging from detective
stories to westerns, jazz recordings to postmodernist verbal collages.
Using language similar to Lacan, he states in a recent interview, "What
we ended up doing in the sixties was to revolt against the colonial
masters."\[15\] But rather than seeking a new form of mastery, his
stupidity is a specific and often razor-sharp critique of easy answers
and political orthodoxies. His first novel, The Free-lance Pallbearers,
explores the country of HARRY SAM, ruled by a man of the same name: a
former used-car salesman who governs from a toilet, since "he has not
been seen since the day thirty years ago when he disappeared into the
John with a weird ravaging illness."\[16\] (Reed anticipates Alec
Baldwin's Trump toilet tweeting joke by nearly 50 years.) The main
character Bukka works as an orderly cleaning up bedpans ("Make-um-shit
Doopeyduk"), and when he is eventually recruited to participate in
political activist art, he protests "I'm not an actor. I'm more of a
clown" (4, 107). The artist's response? "Good \[....\] So are we, tweet,
tweet. See you soon" (107). (Again, more tweeting.) In his second novel,
Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down, a western about a voodoo cowboy named The
Loop Garoo Kid, Reed satirizes orthodox "political" art in the form of
Bo Shmo and the neo-socialist realist gang. The Kid sneers at their idea
that "All art must be for the end of liberating the masses," and instead
asks, "What's your beef with me Bo Shmo, what if I write circuses? No
one says a novel has to be one thing. It can be anything it wants to be,
a vaudeville show, the six o'clock news, the mumblings of wild men
saddled by demons."\[17\] (Again, Reed is ahead of his time, with
fiction subsuming the nightly news.) Reed's most well known novel, Mumbo
Jumbo, follows the "anti-plague" Jes Grew as it "ravages" the U.S. in
the 1920s, causing energy, feelings of good health, an interest in
Haitian culture, and uncontrollable dancing in the streets. The secrets
of Jes Grew are bound in an ancient secret text called The Work; but as
the title of the novel suggests, the Work isn't a book that contains
practical knowledge. In fact, Papa LaBas, the novel's main character and
VooDoo detective, is never able to read the Work. But that's fine with
him; he concludes, "We will make our own future text."\[18\] Reed's
stupidity, then, is never content with a final answer, even when that
answer comes from one of Reed's own books. Instead, his clowning, like
Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s theory of "signifying" derived from readings of
Reed, is always premised on revision and on future action and future
texts.\[19\]

But how does such stupidity actually work? Isn't this just yet another
instance of vulgar postmodernist critique? While Reed's complex work
escapes such an easy criticism, stupidity does seems to work best by
pointing out a lack in ideological arguments that appeal to some
ultimate truth. But politics and criticism aren't so simple anymore, if
they ever were. As Latour reminds us, "the danger \[of the present\]
would no longer be coming from an excessive confidence in ideological
arguments posturing as matters of fact---as we have learned to combat so
efficiently in the past---but from an excessive distrust of good matters
of fact disguised as bad ideological biases!"\[20\] In other words,
isn't stupidity now precisely the problem instead of a critical
solution?

At best, [[the stupidity of]{.underline}]{.mark} a figure like [[Trump
doesn't seem to be a major issue for]{.underline}]{.mark} many of his
[[supporters]{.underline}]{.mark}; as I write this, polls show his
approval rating among Republicans is still in the 80s. At worst, some of
the most prominent praises of Trump take on precisely these postmodern
terms: Trump as the one who "tells it like it is" and reveals "facts" as
"bad ideology"; as a "blockage" to the "corrupt" system of Washington;
as the big Other or subject-supposed-to-know with no desire and no
stable content, who creates desire in the (conservative, middle class,
white) subject. As such, he is a figure who is stupid, not just in the
traditional sense, but also in Lacan's: by lacking any lack whatsoever,
and thriving politically not through policy or reason, but through
desire and revealing the lack in others (Josh Marshall calls this a
"domination by denigration" strategy.\[21\]) Furthermore, much of the
direct moments of critique to Trump -- [[criticisms of his
"policies]{.mark},"]{.underline} debates, media interviews -- [[have
proved unsuccessful]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least in preventing his
rise to power. During the election, such resistance seemed to only
galvanize him as a figure fighting against the "liberal elite," i.e.
those with knowledge. And even though his approval ratings have fallen
drastically, there are still [[millions]{.underline}]{.mark} who
[[persist in]{.underline}]{.mark} an enjoyment of his lack of knowledge:
not only an enjoyment of ignorance, but also a [[sadistic enjoyment at
the suffering of those harmed by Trump's
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[22\] Again, as Latour has pointed out,
[[direct resistance runs the risk of becoming caught up in the
system]{.mark} of dominance]{.underline}. For an example, we need look
no further than how "Black Lives Matter" has been co-opted in a precise
Foucaultian reformulation of the biopolitical "Make Live and Let Die" --
that is to say, "All Lives Matter." (A declaration of sovereignty so
important that Trump repeated it during his acceptance of the Republican
Presidential nomination.)

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps, like fire-fighting fire, [[stupidity
can combat stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the point I wish to
turn to in the following section. But first, it should be declared
emphatically that this line of argument should in no way minimize the
forms of direct resistance that many have already undertaken. Black
Lives Matter and other activist groups are doing extremely important
work in leveling grass-roots public critiques. Indeed, in the past year,
we have seen how these direct resistances have begun to affect the Trump
White House. Rather, this thought experiment is an attempt, to borrow
more of Latour's militaristic rhetoric, to open up an additional front
in this battle; I wonder how tactics of stupidity might translate into
the knowledge based discourses of Academia or the journalist media,
which have seemed somewhat powerless to speak truth to power against the
Right.\[23\]

By way of beginning such translation, I want to highlight a moment of
[[unreadability]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[created]{.mark} a direct and
[effective critique]{.mark} of Trump]{.underline}, and one
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} importantly [[doesn't pit knowledge against
stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}, or truth against falsity. I'm referring
here to Johari Osayi Idusuyi's protest at a Trump rally in Nov. 2015,
where she simply sat behind Trump while reading a copy of Claudia
Rankine's Citizen. Idusuyi functions as both Lacanian blockage and as
unreadable presence: a bit of the Lacanian Real.\[24\] She is present at
least seemingly as a compliant supporter. Furthermore, she is often
literally unreadable on camera precisely because she is reading with a
book obscuring her face. And unlike the other protesters at the rally,
who attempted to directly confront Trump and his supporters and were
violently ejected, Idusuyi instead merely exists (or "persists," to
borrow McConnell's "critique" of Elizabeth Warren) within the space of
the rally. But through such existence, she makes all the Trump
supporters around her visibly uncomfortable and distracted, yet unsure
precisely how to respond to this woman calmly reading. Indeed, Rachel
Maddow referred to Idusuyi as an "unbowable presence," and this is
precisely what the type of political subjectivity I am trying to
theorize: an unreadable yet unbowable presence, one that functions by
both blocking the discursive system and refusing to be made a part of
it. This "stupidity" is a far cry from ignorance; in Lacan's terms, [it
is]{.underline} instead [a lack of a lack]{.underline}.\[25\]

Inside the book that Idusuyi was reading, Claudia Rankine tackles many
of these same issues: presence, lack, black bodies, and alternative
forms of knowing. Her poetry, like Idusuyi's presence, is also often
filtered through screens; the book contains reproductions of images from
YouTube videos and sports matches. Reflecting on Hennessy Youngman's
YouTube performance pieces, which "\[suggest\] black people's anger is
marketable," she writes,

You begin to think, maybe erroneously, that this other kind of anger is
really a type of knowledge: the type that both clarifies and
disappoints. It responds to insult and attempted erasure simply by
asserting presence, and the energy required to present, to react, to
assert is accompanied by visceral disappointment: a disappointment in
the sense that no amount of visibility will alter the ways in which one
is perceived.\[26\]

While not specifically theorizing stupidity or clowning like Reed,
Rankine negotiates a complex and dialectical form of knowledge: one that
combines thinking with error and transforms nouns and feelings into
verbs and actions, and vice versa. In so doing, she sublates "this other
kind of anger" into a new form of knowledge, one that both "clarifies"
and further muddies the waters. But that is precisely the point. This
anger/knowledge is not valuable because of its clarification,
correspondence, or truth-value --- it's not a form of "alternative
facts" --- but rather because of its simply being there. The
knowledge-as-presence that Rankine creates inside the book perfectly
complements the presence-as-knowledge created by Idusuyi at the Trump
rally. Of course, this knowledge isn't simply utopian; it might not make
a difference in "the ways in which one is perceived." Rankine continues
in the next paragraph: "Recognition of this lack might break you apart.
Or recognition might illuminate the erasure the attempted erasure
triggers. Whether such discerning creates a healthier, if more isolated,
self, you can't know" (24). The poetic recognition of lack as breakage
in Rankine is a very real concern for protesters, who risk the literal
breaking of their bodies in the fight to be recognized. But what Rankine
holds out is a hope that such erasure might lead to more erasure: that
lack might create its own lack in return. Indeed, "recognition" and
"illumination" and "erasure" all become so mixed up that ultimately,
"you can't know." But in that space of not-knowing --- of attentiveness
to the Other's desires and our own lacks of the perfect answers ---
perhaps a politics of stupidity can begin.\[27\]

Reflecting on the melancholia of critique, and the deadlock of the Left
and the Right more generally, [[this new type of
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark} --- characterized by stupidity, humor, and
"unbowable presence" --- [[is an urgent **political and ethical
necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The resistor must realize that, along
with Foucault, "We must not think that by saying yes to sex \[and other
prohibitions\], one says no to power."\[28\] But I would like to add
here that [[we can't just shout "No!"]{.underline}]{.mark} any longer
either (though we should definitely keep doing that too). In addition,
[[the political subject]{.mark} with unknowable]{.underline} "clownlike
[integrity" [must resist through]{.mark}]{.underline} her very
[[unreadable presence ̶ and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [**[through the
very act of reading]{.mark}**]{.underline} too. We can thus draw a
direct line from the "unsuccessful" protests of Occupy Wall Street in
2011-2012, through the demands of Bernie Sanders, all the way to the
recent Women's Marches in Washington, D.C. Ishmael Reed's "Future Text"
ends up written by the bodies of the protestors; isn't the galvanization
of the Left to take to the streets just like the "enlivening"
anti-plague Jes Grew, "electric as life and \[...\] characterized by
ebullience and ecstasy" (6)? In shifting perspectives, many of the
critiques against these protesters --- that they are lazy and should get
jobs, that they aren't articulating coherent demands, that their bodies
aren't really oppressed --- are reformulated into the precise form of
their resistance. As Rankine writes about tennis judge Mariana Alves'
notoriously bad (and seemingly racist) calls against Serena Williams,
"Though no one was saying anything explicitly about Serena's black body,
you are not the only viewer who thought it was getting in the way of
Alves's sight line" (27). Once again, she theorizes a form of literally
unspoken knowledge that is found in the presence of a body as an
obstruction to the dominant, white "sight line." Lacan might even call
such an obstruction the gaze. And as both Rankine's book and Idusuyi's
presence make clear, such a form of knowledge is present through
reading.

In response to a President who tweets and doesn't read, the unreadable
presences of these readerly bodies in the streets is the perfect
political response. For Lacan, in the final stage of his dialectic of
desire, the subject confronts the lack in the big Other; when asked
"What do you want of me?", the big Other responds with "Nothing." The
protests against Trump reverse the terms. We might imagine a new slogan
chanted at the next march:

**[["What do we want?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[["Nothing!"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[["When do we want it?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[["NOW!"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Of course, there are numerous literal demands that the protesters are
fighting for. But such a demand for nothing is not without precedent.
[Radical [abortion rights activists]{.mark} in the 1960s [presented the
New York legislature with **a blank piece of paper as their proposed
bill**, the implication being that their bodies should not be regulated
by laws in any way]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[29\] [[This posture of
negativity]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[locates power not in the figure
of a new master, but in the bodies of the protestors themselves]{.mark}.
Thus, [demand takes the form of a lack of a lack]{.mark}]{.underline},
but more importantly, of [a demand]{.underline} and a lack [that isn't
going away]{.underline}: one that obstructs "sight lines" through its
"unbowable presence."

Slavoj Žižek has termed this type of resistance "passive violence," in
response to the debate about whether it was OK to punch neo-Nazi Richard
Spencer. (Žižek says no.)\[30\] But notwithstanding the schadenfreude of
such violence, I have tried to shift the locus of passive violence to
stupidity, like the clowning of Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer. In so
doing, I would also shift terms, both Žižek's and my own from the early
version of the paper: moving from active compliance to active, present
stupidity. Kate McKinnon's Kellyanne Conway, from the March 4th, 2017
Saturday Night Live, perfectly represents such a shift: instead of jokes
or sketches, her character merely appears at brief moments throughout
the broadcast, sitting in a red dress and playing with her phone, a
perfect parody of the infamous "couchgate" photo of the real life
Conway.\[31\] This isn't a joke per se: nothing is said, and McKinnon
just repeats the same things that Conway did. But in so doing, she also
enacts the same gesture of stupidity that ties these many disparate and
complex forms of political resistance together as obstructive presence:
from Reed's Loop Garoo Kid to Claudia Rankine, or from Johari Osayi
Idusuyi to Melissa McCarthy. These disparate forms of stupidity return
us, full circle, to Marx's notion of history: first as tragedy, then as
farce. Of course, we can't overlook the complex histories and
differences that inform these different acts of resistance.\[32\] But,
taken together in a moment of contingency and solidarity, perhaps the
different histories might lead to [[a politics not only of stupidity,
but]{.mark} ultimately togetherness: a [togetherness that recognizes
difference and the unreadability of the Other, but also how that
presence can still belong]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [[Lacan's
primary example for]{.underline}]{.mark} silliness,
[[stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}, and nonsense [[is
love]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[33\] Or as Rankine says towards the close of
her book, "You smile dumbly at the world because you are still feeling
if only the feeling could be known and this brings on the moment you
recognize as desire" (153).

### Interior Intersubjectivity

#### Our alternative is interior intersubjectivity

**Viego 07** \[Antonio Viego, Professor of Ethnic Studies @ Duke, *Dead
Subjects: Toward a Politics of Loss in Latino Studies*, 2014, \*brackets
inserted for gendered language\* //Stefan\]

Brieﬂy, for Lacan, [the subject at the end of analysis is no longer a
slave to the demand seen to issue from the Other; the subject learns to
assume responsibility for \[themselves\] by becoming \[their\] own
cause,]{.underline} as it were. For Spillers, the subject who vigorously
practices an ''interior intersubjectivity'' achieves a similar release
from the Other insofar as he is no longer a slave to the demand that
issues from race as a structure of narrativity and signiﬁcation that
attempts to exhaust the meaning of human subjectivity. She writes: The
question, then, for this project is not so much why and how ''race''
makes the difference---the police will see to it---but how it carries
over its message onto an interior, how ''race,'' as a poisonous idea,
insinuates itself not only across and between ethnicities but within.
What I am positing here is the blankness of ''race'' where something
else ought to be, that emptying out of which I spoke earlier, the
evacuation to be restituted and recalled as the discipline of a
self-critical inquiry. In calling this process an interior
intersubjectivity, I would position it as a sort of power that
countervails another by an ethical decision.∞≤ [The practice of interior
intersubjectivity helps the speaking subject locate the space in which
race falsely dwells as a structure of narrativity and signiﬁcation that
attempts to explain the nature of the human subject.]{.underline} At the
same time[, it helps evacuate and restitute that space for other
knowledge projects of ''self-critical inquiry'' that risk precipitating
a nontransparent subject who can no longer be wrestled down through the
calculus of race.]{.underline} Simply and forcefully[, interior
intersubjectivity concerns rescuing the blank space that race somehow
came to ﬁll in the constitutive work of subjectivity formation in order
to reclaim it as a surface of inscription for other interpretative
efforts. The]{.underline} homologous [critical operations performed in
Spillers and Lacan precipitate a kind of subject who is necessarily
dispersed, decentralized, and in disarray.]{.underline} In the last
paragraph in her essay, Spillers writes, ''My interest in this ethical
self-knowing wants to unhook the psychoanalytic hermeneutic from its
rigorous curative framework and try to recover it in a free-ﬂoating
realm of self-didactic possibility that might decentralize and disperse
the knowing one.''∞≥ Toward the end of Seminar VII, Lacan notes, ''At
the end of a training analysis the subject should reach and should know
the domain and the level of the experience of absolute disarray. It is a
level at which anguish is already a protection, not Abwarten as
Erwartung. Anguish develops by letting a danger appear, whereas there is
no danger at the level of the ﬁnal experience of Hilﬂosigkeit
\[helplessness\].''∞∂ Lacan's notion of disarray is internal to what
Spillers calls ''decentralization'' and ''dispersal.'' [It
is]{.underline} this [disarray---Spillers's attempt to decentralize the
ego and thus undermine its pretension to mastery as the center of
consciousness as well as her attempt to promote the subject's dispersal
into spaces of possibility outside its incarceration in solitary
Imaginary conﬁnement---that the ethnic-racialized subject must
experience in order to understand that \[they are\] a subject of the
signiﬁer who is incalculable, indeterminate, and always in the process
of becoming.]{.underline} Lacan's and Spillers's homologous critical
approaches to theorizing the dispersed, decentralized subject in
disarray are also revealed in the nature of the kind of interpretative
labor each thinks must be performed, one that is not curative in nature
nor in the service of amplifying the ego. She writes, I have chosen to
call this strategy the interior intersubjectivity, which I would, in
turn, designate as the locus at which self-interrogation takes place. It
is not an arrival but a departure, not a goal but a process, and it
conduces toward neither an answer nor a ''cure,'' because it is not
engendered in formulae and prescriptions. More precisely, its operations
are torque-like to the extent that they throw certainty and dogma (the
static, passive, monumental aim) into doubt. This process situates a
content to work on as a discipline, as an askesis, and I would specify
it on the interior because it is found in economy but is not exhausted
by it. Persistently motivated in inwardness, in-ﬂux, it is the ''mine''
of social production that arises, in part, from interacting with others,
yet it bears the imprint of a particularity.∞∑ What Spillers has in mind
[is not the working on the subject that would resemble the
reconsolidation of the ego's masterful powers or the restoration of the
ego as whole]{.underline}, ''It is not an arrival but a departure, not a
goal but a process.''∞∏ [This strategy has to do with frontally
challenging the ﬁxity and rigidity that characterizes the ego's
resistance to subjective growth and change]{.underline}: ''its
operations are torque-like to the extent that they throw certainty and
dogma (the static, passive, monumental aim) into doubt.''∞π Her
speciﬁcation of an [interior as that which is ''in economy'' but not
exhausted by it indirectly critiques the more routine approach to
ethnic-racialized subjectivity and experience through explications
attuned solely to social, cultural, and historical but not psychical
analyses]{.underline}. Her use of the term, askesis reminds one of how
Lacan characterized psychoanalysis's species of interpretative labor. In
''The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis,''
Lacan writes, ''Of all the undertakings that have been proposed in this
century, the psychoanalyst's is perhaps the loftiest, because it
mediates in our time between the care-ridden man and the subject of
absolute knowledge. This is also why it requires a long subjective
ascesis, indeed one that never ends, since the end of training analysis
is not separable from the subject's engagement in his practice.''∞∫
Although throughout her essay Spillers speaks generally of
psychoanalysis, sometimes referring to ''classical psychoanalytic
theory'' and mentioning the names of both Freud and Lacan, I see her
model as primarily Lacanian. [Spillers wants to pursue the
ethnic-racialized subject's signifying dependence. Understanding the
nature of that dependence and the signifying elements that constitute
the subject's symbolic universe are precisely the nature of the
interpretative labor]{.underline} that Spillers has in mind: ''The one
that I am after, then, must be built up from the ground, so to speak,
inasmuch as classical psychoanalytic theory and its aftermath
contradictorily point toward it---a subject in its 'signifying
dependence,' which means that the subject's profound engagement with,
and involvement in, symbolicity is everywhere social.''∞Ω Now that we
have unpacked some of the essential elements that make up Spillers's
psychoanalytic hermeneutic practice of interior intersubjectivity, I
want to explore the speciﬁc relation between what Spillers refers to in
the passage above as ''a subject in its 'signifying dependence''' and
the larger goal announced in the practice of interior intersubjectivity:
the ''evacuation,'' ''that emptying out'' of race ''where something else
ought to be'' in an effort to compel new modes of ''self-critical
inquiry'' not determined by the calculus of race. [There is an
exceedingly seductive, utopic charge to the project of emptying the
space ﬁlled by race. It implies that the subject's signifying dependence
on race would no longer exist, insofar as race in the position of the
Other]{.underline}---to continue mining the similarity between
Spillers's subject and the subject at the end of the Lacanian
analysis---whose demand we think we are still called upon to respond to
has been evaporated. Seshadri-Crooks sharply describes the stubborn ways
in which we continue to hold on to the idea of race: [As a system of
organizing difference, race is very distinctive]{.underline} in relation
to other forms of organization such as caste, ethnicity and nation. [It
is distinctive as a belief structure and evokes powerful and very
particular investments in subjects.]{.underline} [Consider the peculiar
intensiﬁcation of racial identiﬁcation and racial discourse even as the
scientiﬁc untenability of race is ever more insisted upon by scientists
and anthropologists. Even though it has now become commonplace to utter
rote phrases such as ''race is a construct'' or ''race does not exist,''
etc., race itself shows no evidence of disappearing or evaporating in
relevance. It is common sense to believe in the existence of race. Why
do we hold on to race?]{.underline} What is it about race that is
difﬁcult to give up?≤≠ Seshadri-Crooks's questions appear not to bode
well for Spillers's ultimate goal. The positing of ''the blankness of
'race' where something else ought to be'' might be an impossible task
that when actively engaged may in fact serve only to perpetuate the
ongoing hallucination of race in new and no less damaging disguises. I
want to return to one sentence from Spillers's essay and read it in a
way that would suggest less tension between Seshadri-Crooks's insight
and Spillers's goal. Again, Spillers writes, ''What I am posting here is
the blankness of 'race' where something else ought to be, that emptying
out of which I spoke earlier, the evacuation to be restituted and
recalled as the discipline of a selfcritical inquiry.''≤∞ If we agree
that race may register in any number of ways but ''blankness'' won't be
one of them, then we could still understand the ''discipline of a
self-critical inquiry'' as an interpretative practice that understands
that race won't disappear any time soon. [A scrutinous analysis of its
stubborn hold on us and its ongoing role in the constitution of human
subjectivity are the ''something else'' that Spillers is
after]{.underline}. She names this discipline ''[interior
intersubjectivity,'' a hermeneutic strategy that, although it may not
render race blank, will lay bare the processes---psychical, social,
economic, and political--- that explain to us why race won't
budge]{.underline}, why, to return to Seshadri-Crooks's words, it
''shows no evidence of disappearing or evaporating in relevance.''≤≤
[Spillers imagines her hermeneutic as a species of psychoanalytics,
since race cannot be addressed simply through historicist genealogies
that describe its discursive construction.]{.underline} I think Spillers
believes, like Seshadri-Crooks, that [race makes certain constitutive
psychical claims on our existence that don't simply go away because we
describe, ad nauseam, its scientiﬁc untenability, its social
constructedness, its variability over time and cultures,
and]{.underline} so on. The discussion so far, in focusing on Spillers,
was supposed to have broached only the speculative perspective on
ethnic-racialized subjectivity in the context of psychoanalysis, as I
positioned Spillers as representing the speculative and not the
clinical. Yet the reader will surely have noticed how [Spillers's
approach has effectively broken down that opposition and even
reconﬁgured it.]{.underline}

### AT: Spill Up

#### There is no relation between their education and agency -- makes us worse academics and activists

**Schlag '3** (Pierre Schlag, Professor of Law at University of
Colorado, University of Miami Law Review Vol 57:1029, "A Reply -- The
Missing Portion", 4/1/2003)[\\\\AK](file:///\\AK)

FALSE EMPOWERMENT (No. 1) From the very first day, law school training
leads law students to believe that judicial decisions produce important
consequences for the social order. [[The presumption is that]{.mark} the
words of [the judge]{.mark} (if they are well crafted) [will]{.mark}
effectively [produce a]{.mark} social [reality that corresponds]{.mark}
roughly with the words uttered.]{.underline} But what reason is there to
believe this?3 FALSE EMPOWERMENT (No. 2) [[The endlessly repeated
question]{.mark} in first year, \"[What should the court do?\"
leads]{.mark} law [students to believe that courts respond to the force
of the better argument]{.mark}. This would be tolerable if one added two
provisos: 1. [The better argument often means]{.mark} little more than
[the one the courts are predisposed to believe]{.mark}; and 2. In the
phrase \"force of better argument[\" it\'s important to attend not just
to the \"better\" part, but to the other term as
well.]{.mark}]{.underline} FALSE EMPOWERMENT (No. 3) Law students first
learn of many complex social and economic realities through the medium
of case law. What they learn is thus the law\'s vision of these economic
and social realities. Not surprisingly, there is an almost magical
correspondence between legal categories and social or economic
practices. This magical fit leads law students (later to become law
professors) to have an extremely confident view of the efficacy of law.
Many law students are cured of this belief-structure by a stay in the
legal clinic or by law practice.4 There is one group of people, however,
who are generally not cured of this belief-structure at all, but whose
faith is actually intensified. These are the people who hold prestigious
judicial clerkships where an emotional proximity to and identification
with their judge (\"my judge\") leads to an even greater confidence in
the efficacy of law. These people are frequently chosen to teach in law
schools. FALSE EMPOWERMENT (No. 4) False empowerment can be
disempowering. It can also lead to pessimism and despair. Many people
react to a loss of faith in law or legal studies with despair or
pessimism. But this is the despair and pessimism that comes from giving
up a naive or a romantic vision of law and/or legal studies. The
onslaught of this despair and pessimism is a good thing. It is like the
thirty-something who realizes that he is mortal and that life is brief.
Generally, this is not welcome news. PESSIMISM, DESPAIR, ETC. (No. 2)
[[When the academic loses faith in]{.mark} law or [legal
studies]{.mark}, typically [that person is]{.mark} most [troubled
because she has lost the framework that makes her academic project
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline} But so what? Isn\'t the demand that law
conform to an academic project arguably a selfish one? THE CON, THE
JOKE, AND THE IRONIC TRUTH The Con: In the courtroom, the appellate
judge is typically seated behind an elevated bench. On the classroom
blackboard the appellate judge is chalked in above the plaintiff and the
defendant. This is both a reflection and a reinforcement of the belief
that the appellate judge is an intellectually and politically privileged
legal actor. The Joke: In actuality, the appellate judge is a person who
operates in conditions of severe information deficits and whose outlook
is thoroughly manipulated by professional rhetoricians. Very often he
has little or no understanding of the configurations of the social field
to which his rulings will apply. What\'s more, this is a person who is
prohibited from talking about the social field, except with a highly
restricted number of people. The Ironic Truth: On the other hand,
because we believe the appellate judge is a particularly privileged
intellectual and political actor, we contribute to making him so. A
CRUEL HOAX [[Legal intellectuals]{.mark} like to believe that law is an
intelligent enterprise. They [like to believe that the law offers an
interesting vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric through which to think
about the world]{.mark} and law itself.]{.underline} This is naive. The
political demand that law be efficacious means that law must track, must
indeed incorporate popular beliefs about social and economic identities,
causation, linguistic meaning, and so forth. (Those beliefs are often
intellectually bereft.)THE ARGUMENT ROOM [[The argument room is a place
where academic advocates go to argue passionately about law and
politics.]{.underline}]{.mark} (Apologies to Monty Python.) [[Within the
room, arguments are won and lost; triumphs and defeats are had. But
generally, no one outside the room pays much attention to what goes on
inside the room.]{.mark} Sometimes there is seepage and fragments of the
conversations are heard outside the room. [Participants most often spend
their time arguing about what should happen outside the room. This they
call \"knowledge\" or]{.mark} \"understanding\" or \"jurisprudence\" or
[\"scholarship\" or \"politics.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The one thing
that generally cannot be talked about inside the room is the
construction of the room itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} POLITICS (No. 1)
For progressive legal thinkers, politics is a \"theoretical
unmentionable\": [[The concept \"politics\" does a great deal of
theoretical work and yet its identity remains]{.mark} generally [immune
from scrutiny.]{.mark}]{.underline} The categories (right, left) and the
fundamental grammar of politics (progress, reaction, and so forth)
generally go unquestioned. Oddly, while everything else seems to be
contingent, conditional, contextual, and so on, the categories of
politics seem to be oddly stable, nearly transcendent. Strangely, this
occurs at a time when the categories, left and right (and even politics
itself), seem increasingly fragile and non-referential. Still, this is
an intensely political time-political not in the sense of significant
social contestation (not much of that) nor in the sense of ideological
struggle (not happening much either). Rather, political in the sense of
very significant reorganizations and reallocations of power, wealth, and
so on.5 Capital (for lack of a better term) is in a period of rapid
self-reorganization in which it increasingly regiments precincts of life
previously offering some resistance to its grammar-to wit: time, family,
media, public space, wilderness, and so forth. The point is not that
these precincts were immune to capital before, but rather that capital
is advancing at such an intense rate to bring about a significant
disruption and a qualitative change in these precincts. This change is
manifest not only in the colonization of new precincts, but in the
self-organization of capital(new financial vehicles) and, of course, in
new literary and intellectual forms (postmodernism as both symptom and
diagnosis). Meanwhile, the old categories, the old grammar, the old
answers, seem to have lost some of their hold. The right is
intellectually stagnant. And the left is, as a social presence,
ontologically challenged. Indeed, in the United States, we seem at
present to have several right wings and no left wing. This does not mean
that \"politics\" as a social category is necessarily dead. It might
mean simply that we (and others) have not understood, have not grasped,
have not articulated its new configurations. What would be required on
the intellectual level is a re-evaluation not only of the conventionally
articulated categories, but of the social and economic ontology. At its
best, postmodernism (and there has been a lot of bad reactionary and
nostalgic postmodernism) is an attempt to trigger such a re-evaluation.
Progressives, understandably, strive to protect their categories,
grammar, and self-image from these challenges. But this is not without
cost. POLITICS (No. 2) To argue in favor of political positions is
sometimes political. But it is not always political. Sometimes taking up
a political argument is political and sometimes it has no consequences
whatsoever. One cannot know beforehand. But it is a serious mistake to
suppose that arguing in favor of a political position is in and of
itself political. [[Very often]{.mark} in the legal academy, [to argue
for a political (or normative) position is not political at all.
It]{.mark} simply [triggers a scholastic, highly stereotyped
meta-discourse about whether the arguments advanced are sound, accurate,
should be adopted]{.mark}, or the like]{.underline}. A PROBLEM FOR THE
LEFT Traditionally, the left has defended the victims of capitalism,
imperialism, and racism. Indeed, this is an important part of what it
means to be \"on the left[.\" Meanwhile, [in the university, scholarly
attention depends upon the production of new exciting ideas and research
agendas]{.mark}. This poses a problem for the left: [the victims]{.mark}
of capitalism, imperialism, and racism [remain the
same]{.mark}.]{.underline} The political-intellectual defenses advanced
on behalf of victims remain the same. [[This leads to]{.mark} a certain
sense of weariness and [dfjA vu-stereotyped arguments, standard
rhetorical moves. A tendency to fight the same old
fights.]{.mark}]{.underline} Machines. This is a problem. A PROBLEM FOR
PROGRESSIVE LEGAL THINKERS As the author of Laying Down the Law, it just
isn\'t clear to me that law is the sort of thing that is endlessly
perfectible. At times it seems to me that law is a lot like military
strategy. You can try making military strategy the best it can be (maybe
you should). But when you get done it\'s still going to be military
strategy. In that context it would be a good thing to have a few people
(I volunteer) to be less than completely enthralled by military
strategy. The same would go for law. It could be that law is
objectionable in important respects because, well\... it\'s law. If you
are going to mediate social contradictions through a linguistically
normalized system of organized institutional force (e.g., law) you
should not expect the results to be pretty (no matter how humane or
contextual you get along the way). LAW AS A WHITE MALE PRODUCTION It
seems worthwhile to have a few people focus on the production side of
law\'s equations-how is this law produced, what versions of self does it
enact, how does it reproduce itself, how does it achieve rhetorical
supremacy, how does it mediate its various crises, etc. etc. etc. In my
work-the construction of the subject, anti-disciplinarity, the critique
of normativity, the enchantment of reason, the politics of form, the
aesthetics-I have been concerned with these kinds of questions. I think
there is a politics to that-however incomplete, unfinished, elliptical,
underdetermined, and open-ended it might be.6 POLITICS AS ARROGANCE [As
a legal thinker, I believe in trying to do something that has
intellectual, political, or aesthetic value. Any one of the three would
be just great-a real success, something worthy of respect. This is
especially so because, given the institutional paths laid out by the
legal academy, it\'s pretty easy to strike out.7But if one has a choice,
which should one pursue? Perhaps it depends upon where one thinks one
can advance, say, or do something worthwhile.]{.underline} [This will
depend upon a person\'s talents and field as well as his/her estimation
of context and possibilities. From this standpoint [it seems odd that
someone should feel authorized to say: \"You should do
X]{.mark}"]{.underline} LEGAL THOUGHT AS ARROGANCE [[The belief is that
the future of the free world, the maintenance of the rule of law, the
welfare of the republic, the liberation of oppressed peoples, the
direction of the Court, the legitimacy of the Florida election, hangs on
a law professor\'s next article]{.underline}.]{.mark} This is the esprit
serieux gone nuts. [[The most significant effect of this belief is to
arrest thought and end the play of ideas necessary for
creativity.]{.underline}]{.mark} SERIOUS AND NOT (No. 1) Yes, legal
interpretation sometimes takes place in a field of pain and death.9 But
that hardly means that legal studies takes place in a field of pain and
death. It is a residual objectivism that enables legal academics to
believe that when they write about law-what it is or what it should
be-they are somehow engaged in the same enterprise as judges. They\'re
not. It is not that legal scholarship is without consequence. It\'s just
that the institutional and rhetorical contexts are sufficiently
different that the consequences are different as well. SERIOUS AND NOT
(No. 2) There is an important, indeed foundational, category mistake
that sustains American legal thought-it is the supposition that because
academics and judges deploy the same vocabulary and the same grammar,
they are involved in largely the same enterprise. I just don\'t think
that\'s true. My own view is that legal academics are but one social
group (among many) competing for the articulation of what law is. Judges
are another. Social movements, corporations, public interest groups,
administrative officials, criminals, etc., are some of the others. ° For
most of the history of the American law school, academics have anointed
judges as privileged speakers of law. In turn, legal academics have
adopted the habits, forms of thought, and rhetoric of judges-thereby
accruing to themselves the authority to say what the law is. Legal
academics legitimate their claim to say what the law is by fashioning
law as an academic discipline requiring expertise. Legal academics then
hold themselves out as possessing this expertise. Among those critical
theorists who seek to contest this expertise, one can distinguish two
approaches. One approach is to try to reveal the emptiness of the claims
to expertise among the legal intelligentsia and to reveal how these
claims nonetheless gain power. Another approach is to try to relocate
the authority to say what the law is among those who have been excluded.
I do not see these approaches as antithetical, but rather as
complementary. Furthermore, both approaches will in fact reinscribe,
will performatively reinforce, precisely the sort of rhetorics and
hierarchies they contest. No way around that. I think critical thinkers
all do this-though in different ways. And it\'s certainly worthwhile
pointing out how it is being done. \' At the same time, no one is safe
or immune from this sort of criticism. SERIOUS AND NOT (No. 3) To learn
to laugh at what is taken seriously, but is not serious, is a serious
thing to do. To take seriously what is not, is a drag. A PROBLEM FOR
PROGRESSIVES Progressives wish to pursue a politics that is efficacious.
This means keeping track both of the social context in which
progressivism articulates itself (on the side of the subject), and the
social context in which progressivism seeks to register its results (on
the side of the object). But this work of reconnaissance-a work that is
necessarymay bring unwelcome news: namely that progressivism unmodified
is no longer a terribly cogent project. Choices will have to be made: to
defend progressive thought against this unwelcome news or to put the
identity of progressive projects at risk by encountering this unwelcome
news. FORMALISM (OR PIERRE MENARD\'S LAW REVIEw ARTICLE) Formalism is
virtually an inexorable condition of legal scholarship in the following
sense: a legal academic generally writes scholarship outside the social
pressures of what a lawyer would call real stakes, real clients, or real
consequences. The failure of an argument in the pages of the Stanford
Law Review is generally very different from the failure of an argument
in a brief or an opinion. The difference in context changes the
character and consequences of the acts-even if the authors use exactly
the same words. BINARY AND NOT (INSIDERIOUTSIDER, IMMANENT/TRANSCENDENT,
MIND/BODY ETC. ETC. ETC.) It\'s one thing to deploy oppositional
binarism to describe the broad structures of a text. It\'s quite another
to adopt binarism as an intellectual lifestyle choice.12 Oppositional
binarism has a special hold/appeal in American law precisely because: 1)
law is often identified with what appellate courts say it is; and 2) by
the time a case gets to an appellate court, the reductionism of
litigation and the binary structure of the adversarial orientation has
reduced the dispute to an either/or (e.g., liberty vs. equality or
formal equality vs. substantive equality, and so on). But \....
Oppositional binarism flounders because law does not have fixed,
uncontroversial grids. Hence, for instance, the notion that a person is
an insider or an outsider just doesn\'t track with much of anything
(except perhaps the author\'s own formalism). If one thinks about it, a
person is an insider in this respect (he\'s white) but an outsider in
that respect (he\'s working class) and then an insider with respect to
his pedigree (he went to Columbia) but really an outsider within his
insider Columbia status because he was profoundly alienated from the
Columbia social scene and blah blah blah. After a while (very soon,
actually) the insider/outsider distinction loses its hold. The point is,
unless you happen to have a well-formed, non-overlapping fixed grid (and
this would be a very strange thing for a critical theorist to have!),
oppositional binarism (like everything else) ultimately collapses.
Interestingly, there was a moment of slippage in the history of critical
legal studies (or perhaps the fem-crits) when binary oppositionalism
slid from a heuristic into (of all things) a metaphysic! THE MACHINES In
Keith Aoki\'s comic strip, the agents of R.E.A.S.O.N. and P.I.E.R.R.E.
fight each other in a comically clich6d fashion. It is Nick Fury
jurisprudence. And there is something strikingly right about that
(however humbling it may be for me and others). One of the things that
happens in the Nick Fury comic strips (as in Keith Aoki\'s contribution)
is that [[the antagonists deploy machines against each other]{.mark}. In
legal thought, we have a lot of machines in operation.1 3 By this I mean
that a great deal of so-called [legal thought is not really thought at
all-but the deployment of a series of rhetorical operations over and
over again to perform actions]{.mark} (usually destructive in character)
on other peoples\' texts or persons. [Every argument tends to become a
machine.]{.mark} Over time, [legal academics tend to become their own
arguments.]{.mark} Then, of course, [they become their own
machines.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**The success of the alternative depends on its ability to distance
itself from fantasmatic politics**

- The K's only radical because it eschews fantasmic policies like the
  aff

**Stavrakakis, prof govt, 99** \[Yannis---visiting fellow University of
Essex, Lacan and the Political\]

In fact, [articulating Lacanian theory with fantasmatic politics is
equivalent to affirming the irrelevance of Lacanian theory for radical
politics since this articulation presupposes the repression of all the
political insights implicit in Lacan\'s reading]{.underline} and
highlighted in this book. The alleged irrelevance of Lacan for radical
politics is also the argument put forward by Collier in a recent article
in Radical Philosophy. Collier\'s argument is that since it is
capitalism that shatters our wholeness and disempowers us (as if without
capitalism we would be on the road to utopia; obviously, capitalism
occupies the structural position of the antichrist in this sort of
leftist preaching), then Lacan\'s theory is, in fact, normalising
capitalist damage, precisely because alienation is so deep for Lacan
that nothing can be done to eliminate it (\`Lacan is deeply pessimistic,
rejecting cure or happiness as possible goals\', my emphasis).19 Thus
Lacan has nothing to offer radical politics. Something not entirely
surprising since, according to Collier, psychological theory in general
has no political implications whatsoever. The conclusion is predictable:
\'Let us go to Freud and Klein for our psychotherapy \[Lacan is of
course excluded\] and to Marx and the environ­mental sciences for our
politics, and not get our lines crossed\' (Collier, 1998: 41-3).
Surprisingly enough this is almost identical with Homer\'s conclusion:
Lacanian theory is OK as an analytical tool but let us go back to Marx
for our ideological seminar and our utopian catechism! [It is clear that
from a Lacanian point of view [it is necessary to **resist
all**]{.mark}]{.underline} such [reoccupations\' of [traditional
fantasmatic politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. At least [this is the
strategy]{.underline} that Lacan follows on similar occasions. [Faced
with the alienating dimension of every identification, Lacan locates the
end of analysis beyond identification. Since
[utopian]{.mark}]{.underline} or quasi-utopian [[constructions function
through identification]{.underline}]{.mark} it is legitimate, I think,
to draw the analogies with the social field[. If
[analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} [[resists the]{.mark} \'reoccupation\' of
the [traditional strategy of identification]{.mark}]{.underline} --
although it recognises its crucial, but alienating, role in the
formation of subjectivity -- [why should psychoanalytic politics, after
unmasking the crucial]{.underline} but [alienating character of
traditional, fantasmatic]{.underline}, identificatory [politics,
\'reoccupy\' their ground]{.underline}? This rationale underlying the
Lacanian position is not far away from what Beardsworth articulates as a
political reading of Derrida. For Beardsworth, deconstruction also
refuses to implicate itself in traditional politics, in the \'local
sense of politics\' in Beardsworth\'s terminology: [In its]{.underline}
affirmative [[refusal to advocate a politics]{.underline}]{.mark},
deconstruction forms, firstly, [an account of why all political projects
fail]{.underline}. Since the projection of any decision has ethical
implications, deconstruction in fact generalizes what is meant by the
political well beyond the lo­cal sense of politics. In this sense [it
[becomes a radical \'critique]{.mark}]{.underline}[\']{.mark} of
institutions. (Beardsworth, 1996: 19) Similarly, [[the]{.mark}
radicality and political [importance of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Lacanian **[[critique depends on its ability to keep its distance from
fantasmatic politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from politics in the
traditional sense; which is not the same as saying that
[psychoanalysis]{.underline} is apolitical: in fact, it [becomes
political precisely by being critical of traditional
politics]{.underline}, exactly [because]{.underline}, as argued in the
previous chapter, [the political is located beyond the
utopian]{.underline} or quasi-utopian [sedimentations of]{.underline}

[Th e great challenge that psychoanalysis poses for emancipatory
politics]{.underline} --- and for politics as such --- [is its absolute
rejection of the good or the good society.]{.underline} In the opening
of the Politics, Aristotle describes the good as the basic aim of
political activity, and this aim has remained constant in the
intervening 2,500 years.7 Aristotle never att empts to prove this
constitutive remark in his treatise but simply takes it as an
unassailable postulate of political thinking. For subsequent political
thinkers, the question does not concern Aristotle's claim about the good
but in what the good consists. Th ere is unanimity about the political
pursuit of the good not just among political theorists but among almost
everyone who thinks about politics at [all. From the perspective of
psychoanalysis, however, there is no good at all. Th e good society is
unatt ainable]{.underline} not just as a result of the competing desires
of the individuals within the society. Th e theory that aligns social
confl ict with the coexistence of competing individual desires fails to
go far enough in envisioning the antagonistic nature of the social
order[.]{.underline} No matt er how divergent individual desires are,
one could always imagine reconciling them with each other through some
sort of compromise. A thinker such as John Rawls can imagine a just
society despite positing a society divided by innumerable competing
desires on the level of the individual. Justice here would consist in
the idea of fairness --- using one's imagination to envision society
through what Rawls labels a "veil of ignorance" that allows one to make
decisions about justice without taking into account one's individual
interests or desires or social position.8 Th is would facilitate a good
society in which any inequality would be socially justifi ed, and it
would thus reconcile competing individual desire [But the barrier to the
good society]{.underline} runs deeper than this. It [derives from the
very idea of the good]{.underline}, which Freud sees as fundamentally at
odds with itself. **[Th e good itself, not our failures to achieve it,
is the problem]{.underline}**. Th is is the fundamental political
insight that psychoanalysis brings to the table. [It is at once the
challenge that it poses to emancipatory politics and the basis for its
implicit project for emancipation]{.underline}. [As we get closer to the
ideal of a good society, we simultaneously approach the emptiness
concealed within the ideal]{.underline}. **[Th e notion of the good does
not emerge simply from moral reasoning and speculation about the proper
arrangement of society.]{.underline}** We develop this notion only
through the experience of its prohibition. Th at is to say, the
prohibition of the good doesn't form an obstacle to a preexisting ideal
but constitutes the ideal as such. Th e good has no existence outside of
the barriers that we erect around realizing it. As Jacques Lacan points
out in one of his most important political statements, "Th e step taken
by Freud at the level of the pleasure principle is to show us that there
is no Sovereign Good --- that the Sovereign Good, which is das Ding,
which is the mother, is also the object of incest, is a forbidden good,
and that there is no other good. Such is the foundation of the moral law
as turned on its head by Freud."9 **[Th e foundational link between the
good and prohibition renders its pursuit completely
contradictory]{.underline}**. **[Every step toward the good occasions a
corresponding step away from it.]{.underline}** **[Th e closer we come,
the more we undermine the social stability that we hoped to
achieve.]{.underline}** **[Th is occurs]{.underline}** not just **[among
the many utopian socialist projects that have failed]{.underline}** but
across all types of social structures. For psychoanalysis, the good is
not just an unrealizable ideal but a deception incapable of orienting a
coherent and sustainable politics. **[Th is critique threatens to
undermine the very idea of a political project because political
theorists write in order to help bring about change, which means moving
society in the direction of the good]{.underline}** (even if they admit
that the ideal itself is not realizable). Conservative theorists seem
immune to this critique, but they envision a return to the good or the
creation of a social stability that they associate implicitly with the
good.10 [Political theorists of all stripes write to change the world
and assist its progression]{.underline} (or its return to a better
state), [whereas psychoanalysis interprets the world and uncovers the
repetition at work where it seems to be progressing.]{.underline} For
this reason, Julia Kristeva theorizes the political project inherent in
psychoanalysis as one of permanent revolt. **[Rather than forming a
positive program, psychoanalysis, like modernist literature, exists
simply as a negation of identity and power]{.underline}**. In Th e Sense
and Non-sense of Revolt, she argues, "[psychoanalysis]{.underline}, on
the one hand, and a certain literature, on the other, perhaps
[constitute possible instances of revolt culture."]{.underline}11 From
Kristeva's point of view, psychoanalysis is completely political insofar
as it demands revolt, but this revolt can never become revolution.
Psychoanalytic revolt is destined to remain revolt against some existing
power structure toward which it will continue to provide resistance.
Kristeva views psychoanalytic thought as a hiccup in the hegemony of
scientifi c rationality and progress. Any att empt to create a positive
psychoanalytic politics would obviate its role as a key part of revolt
culture.

School, University of Pennsylvania, "Is Deliberative Democracy a
Falsifiable Theory?", Annual Review of Political Science Vol. 11:
521-538, 2/19/2008)

[[Falsifiability is]{.mark} probably [the]{.mark} single [most
intransigent issue in getting normative theory and empirical research to
speak to one another in]{.mark} the realm of [deliberative
theory.]{.mark}]{.underline} Several problems conspire to make
deliberative theory elusive in this respect[. For some theorists,
[deliberation is]{.mark} simply [defined as intrinsically good.]{.mark}
Obviously, such a claim [renders empirical research irrelevant]{.mark}
(see, e.g., Stokes 1998). But even without the assumption of intrinsic
goodness, more complex problems hinder the interaction between empirical
studies and political theory. It is difficult to envision an empirical
test that might produce evidence construed by theorists and empiricists
alike as disconfirming the claims of deliberative theory. This is
because [deliberation falls short on]{.mark} many of [the
standards]{.mark} deemed essential [to good]{.mark} social science
theory, at least as the [theory]{.mark} is currently construed. Beyond
the general issue of falsifiability, deliberative theory falls short of
meeting three requirements for productive social theory that are
enumerated in virtually any textbook: [1. clearly defined concepts; 2.
specification of logical relationships among concepts within the theory;
3. consistency between hypotheses and evidence accumulated to
date.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is, of course, unfair to criticize a
normative theory for lacking the characteristics required of productive
social science theory. But criticism is not my main purpose. Instead, I
want to take seriously the admonition that the two subfields should talk
to one another. To make a dialogue possible, this normative theory must
be translated into the terminology of empirical social science and must
then be subjected to the standards of theory testing within the social
science tradition. It is crucial to address these three problems in
order to accumulate useful empirical evidence on the potential of
deliberative democracy. [Social scientists generally define "theory" as
a set of interrelated statements intended to explain and/or make
predictions about some aspect of social life. Toward those ends, a good
theory is supposed to have well-defined constructs of general
theoretical interest. It is supposed to describe logical associations
among these constructs (which are most often causal associations), and
it should allow for connections between the theoretical constructs and
observable entities.]{.underline} When theories cannot meet these three
criteria, they are generally unproductive in advancing our understanding
of the phenomenon of interest.2 What happens when empirical researchers
attempt to translate deliberative theory into these terms?
[[First]{.mark}, as Thompson points out, they discover [a great deal of
conceptual ambiguity as to what should qualify as deliberation]{.mark}.
Moreover, [the definitions offered]{.mark} by theorists frequently
[conflate causes]{.mark} (criteria defining deliberation) [and
effects]{.mark} (its beneficial consequences).]{.underline} [Second,

**The repetitive nature of the economy of tropes and enjoyment prove
that psychoanalysis is falsifiable -- specifically in the context of
rhetoric**

**Lundberg 12** (Christian Lundberg is an Associate Professor of
Rhetoric at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and

Public: Psychoanalysis and the Science of Rhetoric," 11/26/12) AqN

One of the most hallowed maxims of rhetorical studies is that rhetoric
is an art---a techne for engaging discourse in the properly Aristotelian
sense of the term. Techne implies a systematic mode of experiential
knowledge, but often in declaring that rhetoric is an art, the accent of
this declaration falls on the intuitive and the experiential facets of
techne at the expense of the more systematic charge inherent in it.
[While for much of the rhetorical tradition, techne has primarily taken
the valence of a prudential guide for intuitive judgment, [Lacan turns
to rhetoric to confer on psychoanalysis a scientific status]{.mark}.
Lacan's claims to the "science" of rhetoric respond to a number of
critics who had framed psychoanalysis as an alchemical mix of unfounded
theories, intuitions and inherited practices. Borrowing from Karl
Popper's philosophy of science, such [critiques of psychoanalysis argued
that analytic practice was non-falsifiable]{.mark}, resting on the idea
that no empirical evidence could be mustered to refute it.]{.underline}
Any claim to evidence to the contrary of Freudian theories could always
be elided by generating another explanation with dubious empirical
grounding to account for potential exceptions. In drawing on rhetoric as
a systematic mode for theorizing the nature of the sign, representation,
and the logic and social functions of discourse[, **[Lacan rescues
Freudian categories from non-falsifiability]{.mark}**.
**[Rhetoric]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is so squarely rooted in
"art," **[[became one of Lacan's most powerful allies in articulating
psychoanalysis as a science, providing a vocabulary for
attending]{.mark} to the [repeatable elements of signification that
might be held up to empirical verification]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lacan
vacillated at different points in his career on psychoanalysis's status
as a science, arguing at points that it was clearly a science, at others
that it was not, and at others that it was a special kind of science.61
Generally, Lacan's early career embodied the strongest claim for the
scientific status of psychoanalysis, while in his later career he became
less invested in the idea, arguing that it need not attempt to assume
scientific status to validate itself.62 [What is most interesting about
the ambivalence toward science in Lacan's thought is that at each
instance [where the relationship between psychoanalysis and science
is]{.mark} at stake[, the question of rhetoric is never far from the
conversation]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, in The Psychoses and The
Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, Lacan argues that
psychoanalysis is a science on the basis of its attention to a set of
repeatable logical forms, specifically to trope as a way of specifying
the possible connections underwriting discursive and representational
practices. Other accounts read Lacan as eventually giving up on the idea
that psychoanalysis is a science, but do so, once again, with explicit
reference to rhetoric. For example, Stuart Schneiderman argues that by
1977 Lacan had given up the quest to prove psychoanalysis as a science,
that "after having posed the question of the scientific status of
psychoanalysis for so many years, he had come to the conclusion that it
was not a science. The reason was one offered by Karl Popper, namely
that psychoanalysis was 'irrefutable.' Lacan said that analysis was
closest to rhetoric. . . . Thus analysis seeks to persuade but not
convince, to persuade the analysand to recognize things that he knows
already and to act on his desire."63 Of course, one might take issue
with the account of rhetoric that is implicit in this claim,
particularly on the grounds that the framing of rhetoric in
Schneiderman's account affirms an understanding of rhetoric exclusively
through reference to persuasion, contingency, and probability---a
conception that is, as I have been arguing, at odds with Lacan's
understanding of the work of rhetoric. More accurately, [[rhetoric
affords Lacanian psychoanalysis a status]{.mark} as a special kind [of
science by providing it with]{.mark} a set of techniques for paying
attention to [the mathematical qualities of discourse.]{.mark}
Regardless of how one understands the moniker "science," rhetoric drives
psychoanalysis toward [a systematic account of]{.mark} the possible
modes of connection that animate actually existing discourses, and
toward an observation of the concrete functions of [trope in the social
life of the subject.]{.mark} Lacan derives this understanding of
psychoanalysis as the systematic science of attending to discourse from
Freud.]{.underline} For example, in The Interpretation of Dreams Freud
argues for a practice of reading dreams that revised received methods
for interpreting dreams. Prior to Freud's intervention there was a
long-standing tradition that held that an image in a dream correlated
with an unconscious meaning in much the same way that a word in a
dictionary correlates with a definition. In order to found his mode of
dream interpretation, Freud dissents from a definitional understanding
of dreams by distinguishing between manifest "dream content" and the
underlying logic of a dream, or the "dream-thought."64 Although the
manifest content of a dream may seem utterly random, it is driven by the
dream-thought expressed in it, investing the specific contents of the
dream with a meaning dependent on the thought that articulates it. For
Freud there is no universal protocol for the expression and
interpretation of dream contents, but rather a set of associations
unique to an individual which, although not uniform in content, are
bound by a more universal logic of expression. It is tempting to see in
Freud's presentation of the interpretation of dreams a cognitive
semiotics that verges on a proto-presentation of Saussure's conception
of differential signification, albeit sixteen years prior to the
publication of the Course in General Linguistics. Each element in a
dream means something not because it has an intrinsic referent, but
rather because it is defined by a relationship of difference to other
elements in the dream content, and cumulatively the structure of
differentially related signs allows for an interpretation of the
underlying dream-thought. Naturally, this is the reading of Lacan's
employment of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams by those who see Lacanian
psychoanalysis as an integration of Freud's unconscious and the insights
of Saussure.65 The difficulty arises when one tries to determine what
exactly Lacan is attempting to do by reading the regularities of
structure that animate dreams and, by extension, discourse. On one
account, this reading produces a logic of dreams and discourse that
emphasizes structure at the expense of the empirical. But [a second
account replaces the structuralist poetic account with a rhetorical
conception of trope, inventing a science of rhetoric that forces
attention to the interchange between form and its empirical
manifestations. To instantiate a rhetorical relation between the logics
and manifestation of dream contents, Lacan turns to [a science of
oratory]{.mark} that [drives analytic labor toward the empirical life of
discourses]{.mark}.66 "What specifies a science," writes Lacan," "is
having an object."67 To say that a science must have an object elicits
an objection that specifying an "object" presumes a science engages
something given in advance as opposed to contingently made.]{.underline}
But approaching an object requires equal parts analytic rigor and
prudence: "we must be very prudent, because this object changes . . . as
the science develops. . . . \[W\]e cannot say that the object of modern
physics is the same now as at its birth."68 Attention to a changing
object implies a relationship of mutual determination between the mode
of inquiry and the objects that such a mode takes up. [A science is not
a general theory to be mapped onto reality because sciences are
parasitic on the specific.]{.underline} As Lacan argues, science always
begins with the particular: "To be sure, analysis as a science is always
a science of the particular. The coming to fruition of an analysis is
always a unique case, even if the unique cases lend themselves \... to
some generality. . . . \[A\]nalysis is an experience of the
particular."69 [But what is [the particular object]{.mark} around which
a science of oratory might emerge? The answer [is the economy of trope
and enjoyment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Claiming that Freud drew attention
to a "fundamental" opposition between metaphor and metonymy in
"mechanisms of dreams," Lacan argues that "what Freud calls condensation
is what in rhetoric one calls metaphor, what one calls displacement is
metonymy."70 That this reference to a rhetoric of trope frames Lacan's
application of the vocabulary of structural linguistics is clear from
the concluding sentence of this paragraph: "It's for this reason that in
focusing attention back onto the signifier we are doing nothing other
than returning to the starting point of the Freudian discovery."71 In
"The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis," Lacan
argues that the core insight of The Interpretation of Dreams might be
fruitfully applied to more than just unpacking dreams. The logic that
inheres in dream work is the same logic that underwrites the function of
speech generally. If, following Lacan's reading of Interpretation of
Dreams, one is inclined to agree that speech serves as a synecdoche for
rhetorical processes generally; by extension one might conclude that
speech offers privileged insight into the functioning of everyday
discourses. Thus it is no surprise that Lacan recommends instruction in
rhetoric as an indispensable component of analytic practice. According
to Lacan, this realization should compel attention to the function of
"rhetoric . . . ellipsis and pleonasm, hyperbaton or syllepsis,
regression, repetition, apposition---these are the syntactical
displacements; metaphor, catachresis, antonomasis, allegory, metonymy,
and synecdoche--- these are the semantic condensations in which Freud
teaches us to read the intentions . . . out of which the subject
modulates his oneiric discourse."72 This extension of Freud's dream work
to speech by means of a globalization of trope founds the possibility of
psychoanalysis as a science, via recourse to the scientific properties
of oratory: At the bottom of the Freudian mechanism one rediscovers
these old figures of rhetoric which over time have come to lose their
sense for us but which for centuries elicited a prodigious degree of
interest. Rhetoric, or the art of oration, was a science and not just an
art. We now wonder, as if at an enigma, why these exercises could have
captivated whole groups of men for such a long time. If this is an
anomaly it's analogous to the existence of psychoanalysis, and it's
perhaps the same anomaly that's involved in man's relationships to
language, returning over the course of history, recurrently, with
different ramifications and now presenting itself to us from a
scientific angle in Freud's discovery.73 Why wonder at the "enigma" of a
science of oratory and the "exercises" that constituted it? The
"exercises" that Lacan is most likely referring to were the
progymnasmata---the graduated sequence of somewhat formulaic pedagogical
practices that introduced the student of oratory to the inventional
moves one might make in composing and/or delivering a speech. This
attention to form, embodied in both a theory of arrangement and
delivery, attuned the budding orator to the regularities in speech that
render inventional moves not only intelligible, but potentially
eloquent. Oratorical practice had foreseen and, long in advance of
contemporary linguistics, "discovered" the formal properties animating
discursive practice. There are two senses of the word "formal" for
Lacan: one that relies on quantification and another that relies, if not
on math as we typically understand it, then on the mathematizable, or
that which can be symbolically rendered as a repeatable relation.[74 A
science is defined by mathematization, as opposed to quantification:
"what is distinctive about positive science, modern science, isn't
quantification but mathematization and specifically combinatory, that is
to say linguistic, mathematization which includes series and
iteration."75 The oratorical tradition discovered that rhetorical
invention was scientific: in discovering the progymnasmata, the
tradition articulated a conception of inventio (invention) as the
discovery of repeatable symbolic forms]{.underline}. Lacan prefers the
first sense of "formal" because it comports with oratorical pedagogy's
insight that language is mathematizable (amenable to a description of
its repeatable formal properties), which is the condition of possibility
for a science of oratory. [[The science of oratory discovers a mode of
knowing that]{.mark} would eventually [make "linguistics the most
advanced]{.mark} of the human sciences" by specifying that which is
formally repeatable in the life of the subject and its discourses.76
This understanding of rhetoric moves it from a prudential "art" of the
intuitive intersubjective judgments to the symbolic science of
forms.]{.underline} For Lacan, an art premised on the disciplining of
critical intuition does not move beyond the Imaginary because
"everything intuitive is far closer to the Imaginary than the
Symbolic."77 In place of the art of intersubjectively grounded
intuition, Lacan calls for attention to the trans-subjective apparatus
of the Symbolic: "the important thing here is to realize that the chain
of possible combinations of the encounter can be studied as such, as an
order which subsists in rigor, independently of all subjectivity. . . .
\[T\]he symbol is embodied in an apparatus---with which it is not to be
confused, the apparatus being just its support. And it is embodied in a
literally trans-subjective way."78 [[This]{.mark} understanding of
rhetoric as science does not abandon the subject; rather, it [decenters
the subject as a taken-for-granted interpretive maxim, replacing]{.mark}
attention to [what goes on between subjects]{.mark} with the formal
movement of tropes, a movement that is mathematizable, and therefore
amenable to a formal scientific account of its effects: In as much as
~~he is~~ \[they are\] committed to a play of \[the Symbolic\], to a
symbolic world . . . ~~man~~ \[human\] is a decentered
subject]{.underline}. Well, it is with this same play, this same world,
that the machine is built. The most complicated machines are made only
with words. Speech is first and foremost that object of exchange whereby
we are reorganized. . . . That is how the circulation of speech begins,
and it swells to the point of the symbol which makes algebraic
calculations possible. The machine is the structure detached from the
activity of the subject. The symbolic world is the world of the
machine.79 [The world of the symbolic is machinic in a very specific
way: only insofar as it relies on the set of regularized, logically
possible connections between words and other words. In other words, the
Symbolic is machinic because it is tropologically constituted. But
because [the Symbolic is tropologically constituted]{.mark}, its
machinic nature is [premised on the]{.mark} various failures in unicity
that invite the [trope as a compensatory function]{.mark}. Thus, if the
Symbolic is a machine, it is a machine that fails.]{.underline} In the
next chapter, I take up the paradox of the failing machine by suggesting
the metaphor of economy as a way of parsing the relationship between the
machinic (or automatic) and its failure in the life of the Symbolic.

[Although commentators]{.underline} periodically [declare that Freud is
dead, his]{.underline} repeated [burials lie on shaky grounds.
Critics]{.underline} typically [attack an archaic version of
psychodynamic theory that most clinicians similarly consider obsolete.
Central to contemporary psychodynamic theory is a series of propositions
about]{.underline} (a) [unconscious]{.underline} cognitive, affective,
and motivational [processes]{.underline}; (b) ambivalence and the
[tendency for affective]{.underline} and motivational [dynamics to
operate in parallel and produce compromise solutions]{.underline}; (c[)
the origins of many personality]{.underline} and social [dispositions in
childhood]{.underline}; (d) [mental representations of the
self,]{.underline} others, and relationships; [and (e) developmental
dynamics. [An **enormous body of research**]{.mark} in cognitive,
social, developmental, and personality psychology now
[supports]{.mark}]{.underline} many of [these propositions. [Freud\'s
scientific legacy]{.mark} has implications for a wide range of
domains]{.underline} in psychology, such as integration of affective and
motivational constraints into connectionist models in cognitive science.
Freud, like Elvis, has been dead for a number of years but continues to
be cited with some regularity. Although the majority of clinicians
report that they rely to some degree upon psychodynamic 1 principles in
their work ( Pope, Tabachnick, & Keith-Spiegel, 1987 ), most
[researchers consider psychodynamic ideas to be]{.underline} at worst
[absurd and obsolete and]{.underline} at best [irrelevant or of little
scientific interest]{.underline}. In the lead article of a recent
edition of Psychological Science, Crews (1996) arrived at a conclusion
shared by many: \"\[T\]here is literally nothing to be said,
scientifically or therapeutically, to the advantage of the entire
Freudian system or any of its component dogmas\" (p. 63).
[[Despite]{.mark} the **[explosion of empirical studies of unconscious
cognitive processes]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Greenwald, 1992 ;
Kihlstrom, 1987 ; Schacter, 1992 ), few reference Freud; none cite any
contemporary psychodynamic work; and in general, psychodynamic concepts
are decreasingly represented in the major psychology journals ( Robins &
Craik, 1994 ). [The situation is similar in the popular media and in
broader intellectual discourse. Publications]{.underline} ranging from
Time to the New York Review of Books [periodically publish Freud\'s
intellectual obituary, with critics charging that Freud\'s
ideas]{.underline}--such as his dual-instinct theory or his hypotheses
about female personality development--[are seriously out of date and
**without scientific merit**]{.underline} (e.g., Crews, 1993 ). Many
aspects of Freudian theory are indeed out of date, and they should be:
Freud died in 1939, and he has been slow to undertake further revisions.
[His [critics]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
equally [**[behind the times]{.mark}**, attacking Freudian views of the
1920s as if they continue to have some currency in their original
form]{.underline}. **[[Psychodynamic theory]{.mark} and therapy have
[evolved considerably]{.mark}]{.underline}** since 1939 when Freud\'s
bearded countenance was last sighted in earnest. [Contemporary
[psychoanalysts]{.mark}]{.underline} and psychodynamic therapists [[no
longer write]{.mark} much [about ids and egos]{.mark}, nor do they
conceive of treatment for psychological disorders as an archaeological
expedition in search of lost memories]{.underline} ( Aron, 1996 ;
Gabbard, 1994 ; Horowitz, 1988 ; Kolb, Cooper, & Fishman, 1995 ;
Mitchell, 1988 ; Wachtel, 1993 ). People do sometimes describe feelings
or behaviors in therapy that conform remarkably to aspects of Freud\'s
psychosexual theories (such as a patient of mine with erectile problems
whose associations to a sexual encounter led to an image of having sex
with his mother, followed by some unpleasant anal imagery).
Nevertheless, [psychotherapists who rely on theories derived from Freud
do not typically spend their time lying in wait for phallic
symbols]{.underline}. They pay attention to sexuality, because it is an
important part of human life and intimate relationships and one that is
often filled with conflict. Today, however, most [[psychodynamic
theorists]{.mark} and therapists spend]{.underline} much of [their time
[help]{.mark}ing [people with problematic interpersonal
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as difficulty getting emotionally
intimate or repeatedly getting intimate with the wrong kind of person
(see Greenberg & Mitchell, 1983 ).

LIMITS OF TRANSGRESSION AND THE SUBJECT"\]

That is not to say, however, that Kristeva's understanding of Mikhail
Bakhtin's notion of the carnivalesque is one of lawlessness: "In fact,
this '[[transgression' of]{.mark} linguistic, logical and social codes
[within the carnivalesque only exists and succeeds]{.mark}, of course,
[because it accepts another law]{.mark}"]{.underline} (41). [As Bataille
notes, [if transgression is to be lawless it becomes an unequivocal act
of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}: Often [[the transgression of a taboo
is no less subject to rules than acts that are law
abiding]{.underline}]{.mark}. No liberty here. "At such and such a time
and up to a certain point this is permissible"---that is what the
transgression concedes. But once a limited licence has been allowed,
unlimited urges towards violence may break forth (2006, 65). In turn, a
[transgression adheres to its own esoteric law]{.underline}, whether it
is de Sade's pursuit of pleasure, [[Bataille's laws of appropriation and
excretion]{.mark}, or the injunction to throw off and usurp societal
power relationships by [revel]{.mark}ling [in the
carnivalesque]{.mark}]{.underline}. When [a transgression is no longer
bound by law, it becomes limitless, pushing towards an anarchy of
unmediated violence]{.underline}. Indeed, [[this articulation of the
possibility of a violence that becomes limitless distinguishes
Bataille]{.mark}'s thought from Michel Foucault's]{.underline}.
Foucault, although clearly indebted to Bataille, posits that [[the
relationship between transgression and law takes the form of a spiral
which no simple infraction can exhaust]{.mark}.]{.underline} Perhaps
\[transgression\] is like a flash of lightening in the night which, from
the beginning of time, gives a black and dense intensity to the night it
denies, which lights up the night from the inside, from top to bottom,
and yet owes to the dark the stark clarity of its manifestation, its
harrowing and poised singularity; [the flash loses itself in this space
it marks with its sovereignty and becomes silent now that it has given a
name to obscurity]{.underline} (\[1963\] 1999, p.61). Naturally [[there
is a danger here of hypostatizing transgression through evocative
language]{.mark} and imagery]{.underline}; Foucault's turns of phrase
"flash of lightening" and "black, intense density of the night" giving a
rhetorical power to theory that encourages a confusion between, on the
one hand, the pull and connotation of rhetorical imagery speaking of
transgression, and, on the other, the reality of a single transgression
that may be witnessed a posteriori. [This is an inherent issue that
inflects any conceptualising of transgression,]{.underline} to
paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche, [within the limits of the prison house
of language]{.underline}. It is [the variety of connotations inherent to
transgression that still limits us today in talking about it in any
unified, closed, or purely denotative way]{.underline}. Within
postmodern [[culture, the conditions that make transgression possible
have changed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critics have argued that [[the
decline of paternal symbolic authority]{.mark} in contemporary society
[has altered the meaning of transgression]{.mark} and has transformed it
into an act that has more in common with the norm.]{.underline} When
prohibiting limits are no longer stable but [[fragile, transgressive
acts become ultimately redundant within a society that recognizes no
rules]{.mark}.]{.underline} Reading and appropriating the work of
Lacan[,]{.underline} Slavoj Žižek writes that, [For Lacan, [the]{.mark}
Kantian [overcoming of the "dialectic" of Law and desire]{.mark}--- as
well as the concomitant "obliteration of the space for inherent
transgression"---is a point of no return in the history of
ethics:]{.underline} there is no way of undoing this revolution, and
returning to good old times of prohibitions whose transgression
sustained us. This is why [today's desperate neo-conservative attempts
to reassert "old values" are ultimately a failed perverse strategy of
imposing prohibitions which can no longer be taken
seriously]{.underline} . . . Prohibition against which we can assert our
freedom is no longer viable, our freedom is asserted as autonomous,
every limitation/constraint is completely self-posited (2006, 93-4).
That is why for Žižek, [[Bataille is "strictly premodern" because he
insists on the dialectic of the Law and its transgression; the necessity
to create limits in order to violate them]{.mark}]{.underline} (95). For
Žižek it is [the Law]{.underline} that [transgresses the stability of
our pleasure "as the shattering force of the absolute destabilizing
'heterogeneity'"]{.underline} (ibid.). With no proper limits, the
freedom to transgress comes with the obligation to enjoy. Thus, the
difficulty for today's civilised subject is to set their own limitations
(90). [[The "law itself]{.mark}," Žižek writes, ["is the highest
transgression]{.mark}]{.underline}" (2003, 53) as
[[enjoyment]{.underline}]{.mark}, which we experience as transgression,
[[is never a free choice but always imposed on the
subject]{.underline}]{.mark} (1991, 9). [[Thus the law becomes the only
true transgression which changes "all the ordinary criminal
transgressions into an indolent positivity]{.mark}"]{.underline} (30).
[The Law is then what commands jouissance.]{.underline} Žižek explains
that in postmodernity [[there is a turn from the figure of paternal
authority to the one of the obscene primordial]{.underline}]{.mark}
Father-Jouisseur, the [[uncompromising God who "does not have to account
for anything]{.underline}]{.mark} He does" (1999, 318). [The Law is
split between symbolic law and its superego supplement that demands the
subject to enjoy]{.underline}. However, the latter's demand for
enjoyment and the freedom to enjoy become a responsibility where the
command to enjoy in the end bars access to enjoyment. The subject's
superego, no longer able to identify with a symbolic authority that
defines a limit and punishes transgressions, is urged to transgress.
However, without a Symbolic Father transgression is joyless. [[Once
everything is permitted desire is placed into crisis. The lack of a
proper symbolic prohibition imprisons the subject in a repetitive cycle
of ineffectual transgressions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### To exist as a speaking subject within debate entails entry into the complex consensuses over meaning, norms, practices, and traditions as well as taboos which are constitutive of the register of the Symbolic. The elusive nature of the signifier forces subjects to confront a vague, overwhelming sense of loss which instills an unattainable chain of desire. This absence defines subjectivity and cannot be overcome by any individual---setting the foundation of the fruitless project of trying to satisfy the lack. 

McGowan 2016. Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television Studies

Free Markets, Columbia University Press, 2016. Pg. 28-32

When he writes Beyond the Pleasure Principle in 1920,
[Freud]{.underline} begins to define the subject through its
constitutive loss. From this point on in his thinking, he [**conceives
of the subject as completely determined by loss, as driven toward its
own destruction**---a process that he misleadingly labels \"death
drive."]{.underline} Though there are hints of this breakthrough in
earlier works, the radicality of the 1920 revolution should not be
understated. In fact, even Freud himself did not fully grasp its
radicality, as evidenced by his failed attempt to reduce the subject\'s
repetition of failure and loss to a tendency to return to an inorganic
state. [Death drive connotes a desire to die, which is why it leads
readers of Freud]{.underline} (and even Freud himself) [astray. What he
is really onto with this concept is that [the subject finds satisfaction
in repeating loss,]{.mark} that the subject\'s satisfaction is
inextricable from failure. [**No one sets out consciously to fail,**
and, even if one did,]{.mark} the act of [making failure a goal
would]{.mark} immediately [transform it into]{.mark} a different form of
[success.]{.mark} **Within consciousness [the subject cannot give
failure primacy. Consciousness is oriented around projects in which the
subject aims at succeeding,]{.mark}** []{.mark}and the failures of these
projects, from the perspective of consciousness, are only contingent
failures the subject can attempt to remedy by trying again or trying
harder. **Unconsciously[,]{.mark} however, [the subject depends on
failure to satisfy itself. Failure and loss produce the object as
absent, and it is]{.mark} only [the absence of the object that renders
it satisfying.]{.mark} Absence animates the subject, driving it to act,
in a way that presence cannot.**]{.underline} If we think about who
marches in the street, it is those who lack, not those who have, and
when those who have do march, it is because the threat of loss manifests
itself. Even though they march for the elimination of this lack, it is
absence that motivates them to march in the first place. It is also
absence or the threat of it that enables us to get out of bed in the
morning and go to work. The subject that had no absence in its existence
would be unable to act and would lack the impetus even to kill itself.
After seeing numerous patients display their attachment to absence and
loss, Freud concludes that it holds the key to the subject\'s form of
satisfaction. We can see this play out in sports fandom. Though we
consciously root for our favorite team to win, we find more unconscious
satisfaction in the persistent struggles of the sports team that we root
for than in its unqualified successes. The close game is infinitely more
interesting than the blowout because it enables the fan to experience
loss while not having loss enter into consciousness. No one wants to
root for a team that wins all its games, and if fans flock to the games
of teams that win all the time, they go to see the loss (or potential
loss) that will disrupt the winning, just like auto racing fans go to
see cars crashing (or potentially crashing), though this desire remains
unconscious. Even when our favorite team wins a championship, we begin
almost immediately to consider how they might fare the next year. [This
is a way of leaving the terrain of success for that of potential
failure. When we achieve the pinnacle of success, we seek out a way to
return loss into our existence by imagining a new challenge or embarking
on a new project. [**Loss injects value into the subject\'s existence
and gives it an object that provides satisfaction.**]{.mark} Freud\'s
conception of the priority of loss and its repetition]{.underline}
troubles other psychoanalysts (like Fairbairn, for instance) because it
[highlights the impossibility of any satisfaction associated with
obtaining the object.]{.underline} After this point, for Freud, one
simply cannot have the satisfying object. [**[Any notion of success
becomes unthinkable]{.mark}, and one must reconceive satisfaction in
terms of how one fails. [Failure becomes the only option.]{.mark}** On
the basis of privileging failure, Freud reimagines the object in a way
that challenges both much of the history of philosophy and the psychic
demands of capitalism. [The object is not an object that the subject
hopes to obtain but a limit that the subject encounters. The subject
cannot overcome the limit but constitutes itself]{.mark} and its
satisfaction [through the limit.]{.mark} That is to say, the object that
thwarts the subject\'s efforts at obtaining it retroactively creates the
subject around the recalcitrance.]{.underline} The subject seeks out
what it cannot obtain and latches itself onto these objects. Its failure
with regard to them provides a satisfaction that completely defies the
capitalist image of reality. Freud\'s conception of the object enables
us to rethink the famous slogan from May 1968 in France. The mantra of
this movement---[jouir sans entraves (enjoy without
hindrances)---expresses the critique of capitalism's
repressiveness,]{.underline} the critique that dominated much of the
twentieth century. [The problem with this]{.underline} slogan [is that
eliminating the barriers to enjoyment would eliminate the source of
enjoyment. By slightly changing it to jouir les entraves (enjoy the
hindrances), we capture the constitutive importance of the obstacle.
[Satisfaction exists in the obstacle that]{.mark} the object erects in
the face of the subject\'s efforts to obtain it rather than in the
[eradication of all obstacles.]{.mark} But this is what the capitalist
imperative to accumulate enables us to avoid confronting. **[The
speaking subject satisfies itself through its process of failing to
obtain its object, even if this goes unrecognized by the subject
itself.]{.mark} The relationship between subjectivity and loss leads the
subject to flee this recognition and find asylum in the framework of
capitalist accumulation. [The subject repeats a constitutive loss
because loss is the only way that the speaking subject has to relate to
objects]{.mark}**, even though capitalism provides the image of an
alternative. **The signifier confronts the subject with an absence that
forms subjectivity and that the subject can never overcome[.]{.mark} But
[the loss that haunts the subject also constitutes the subject, which is
why it seeks to repeat this loss.]{.mark}** The signifier creates the
subject through the act of removing what is most essential for the
subject, even though this essential object doesn\'t exist prior to its
removal. From this point on, [the subject will remain unable to divorce
satisfaction from loss.]{.mark}]{.underline} One might say that through
the signifier the subject loses the object into existence. Loss
generates the object at the same time that it marks its disappearance,
which has a determinative effect on how the subject satisfies itself.
[[The subject may find fleeting pleasure in success]{.mark} and
achievement, but [its only satisfaction will take the form of the
repetition of loss.]{.mark} [Subjects]{.mark} undermine themselves and
[self-sabotage not because they are]{.mark} stubborn or [stupid but
because this is their]{.mark} path to [satisfaction.]{.mark} For the
speaking subject, [winning is only a detour on the way to
losing.]{.mark} Even the winners in the world of the signifier are
ultimately on the side of defeat, but just take a longer time to get
there than others.]{.underline} When we understand the difference
between instinctual beings and speaking subjects, the appeal of thinking
about ourselves in terms of instinct rather than subjectivity becomes
self-evident. Instinctual beings have the capacity to overcome loss and
obtain satisfaction through the object they seek. Instinctual beings can
become winners that suffer only contingent failures rather than
remaining ensconced in perpetual failure. Instinct holds within it the
promise of a satisfaction untainted by loss, a full satiation that, even
if it soon disappears, can often be replicated. The being envisions a
goal that would provide satisfaction and then either attains the goal or
not. Success may be difficult and may not endure, but it\'s not
impossible. But the subject attains satisfaction through the repetition
of its inability to obtain its object. [[**Failure is the subject\'s
mode of success.** Lacan]{.mark} describes this in one of his most lucid
explanations of the structure of subjectivity.]{.underline} In Seminar
XI, [he separates the subject\'s goal from its aim and uses a metaphor
to explain the aim. He claims, \"**[When you entrust someone with a
mission, the aim is not what he brings back, but the itinerary he must
take]{.mark}. The aim is the way taken**." **The satisfaction of the
subject derives from the path that it takes.** But what Lacan fails to
add here is that this path necessarily involves an encounter with loss:
rather than seeking out its object, **the subject finds ways to miss it
and to ensure that it remains lost. [The lost object is constitutively
lost, and the satisfaction that it offers depends on it remaining
so.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The subject has no hope that it might attain
its lost object, which is why psychoanalysis must refrain from
describing the infant\'s satisfying relationship with the mother\'s
breast prohibited by the father. It is only in retrospect (or from the
perspective of an observer) that this relationship appears perfectly
satisfying. [Freud first conceives of the appeal of loss in response to
his observation of self-destructive actions that appear to violate the
pleasure principle. It is the penchant for self-sabotage and
self-destruction that leads Freud to speculate about the existence of a
death drive that aims at a return to an inorganic state. But we don\'t
have to indulge in this type of hypothesis if we recognize the
constitutive role that loss plays in the subject\'s satisfaction.
Without the lost object, the subject would lose what animates it and the
source of its enjoyment. The act of self-sabotage, even though it
detracts from the subject\'s pleasure, enables the subject to continue
to satisfy itself.]{.underline} In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud
theorizes that the negative therapeutic reaction that subverts the
psychoanalytic cure is not just the product of resistances. The subject
does not want to be cured because it associates healing with the loss of
its foundational loss, a prospect much more horrifying that the pain of
the neurosis. With the recognition of the constitutive role of loss in
the psychic economy, psychoanalysis must alter its conception of the
cure. Rather than simply ending repression or even overcoming loss, the
cure has to involve changing the subject\'s relation to its lost object,
experiencing the intimate connection between loss and satisfaction.

#### Debate is structured by agential fantasy: an impotent political demand on the State answered and alleviated by judges to restart the cycle next round. This ensures demands for governmental action become the fixated on the drive, which precludes a holistic analysis of actual desire and fantasy. Their model of politics is a hysteric demanding a new master. This desire disenfranchises political dissent. Telling the affirmative "[NO]{.underline}" and refusing the demand opens up a new mode of political subjectivity that names its own desire 

Lundberg 2012 (Christian, Assoc. Prof. of Rhetoric @ UNC, Chapel Hill,

Laclau\'s On Populist Reason provides an elegant account of demand as
the fundamental unit of the political, and by extension of politics as a
field of antagonism. [[Laclau]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s basic goal is to
define the specificity of populist reason, or, to give an account of
populism as 'special emphasis on a political logic which, is a necessary
ingredient of politics tout court', of 'Populism, quite simply, as a way
of constructing the political' (Laclau 2005, p. 18). Here, a focus on
demands [[replaces]{.mark} a now prevalent approach focused on various
taxonomies of [populism]{.mark}]{.underline} (which Laclau diagnoses as
hopelessly unsystematic) [[with]{.mark} a more formal account of [the
political]{.mark} based on the logic [of demands]{.mark},
[which]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn [provides a way of thinking about
the political as the space of demand and politics as a practice of
working through specific demands.]{.underline} Demands serve a number of
functions that derive from the split between the universal and the
particular that Laclau relies upon. Demands articulate a specific
political claim at the level of the particular, and also imply a more
generalized relationship to hegemony in the register of the universal.
On this logic, [demands [represent the hegemonic order]{.mark}, creating
an implicit picture of how it functions and might change.]{.underline}
Simultaneously, [demands create possible lines of]{.underline}
equivalential [affinity between others also making demands on the
hegemonic order.]{.underline} Thus, the demand is more fundamental than
the group, in that the operation of the split demand inaugurates all
'the various forms of articulation between a logic of difference and a
logic of equivalence' that animate the social affinities that give
groups their coherence (Laclau 2005, p. 20). The logic of the demand is
in turn the logic of equivalence, and equivalence is as important for
how it animates a group identity, as it is in positing claims on a
hegemonic order. Although Laclau owes a significant debt to Freud and
Lacan, it is not clear that his theory of demand is explicitly crafted
from psychoanalytic categories. For example, how central is enjoyment to
Laclau\'s relatively formal account of the demand? As Glynos and
Stavrakakis have argued, [there is a 'complete and conspicuous absence
in Laclau\'s work of Lacanian categories such as fantasy]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}, perhaps more importantly, [jouissance']{.underline}
(Glynos and Stavrakakis 2006, p. 202). Glynos and Stavrakakis claim that
there is 'to \[their\] knowledge no reference in Laclau\'s work to the
concept of jouissance' (Glynos and Stavrakakis 2006, p. 209). On
Populist Reason contains a brief discussion of the concept of jouissance
as worked out by Copjec, which Laclau summarizes by saying: there is no
achievable jouissance except through radical investment in an objet
petit a. But the same discovery (not merely an analogous one) is made if
we start from the angle of political theory. No social fullness except
through hegemony; and hegemony is nothing more than the investment in a
partial object, of a fullness which will always evade us. The logic of
the objet petit a and the hegemonic logic are not just similar, they are
simply identical. (Laclau 2005, p. 109) There is an elegance to
Laclau\'s point about enjoyment, provided that enjoyment is reducible to
a set of logical forms. This presupposition makes the lack of talk about
jouissance in Laclau\'s work understandable. If jouissance and hegemony
are identical, one does not need Lacan to say something that might be
said more elegantly with Gramsci. Jouissance is simply hegemonic
investment, an elevation of an object or identity to the level of a
thing or a universal. Despite occasional caveats to the contrary, [[the
greatest virtues]{.mark} of Laclau\'s version of the political [stem
from his relentlessly persistent application of a
formal]{.mark}]{.underline}, almost structural [[account of the
political]{.mark}.]{.underline} And, as is the case with many well
executed structuralist accounts, [Laclau\'s system can elegantly
incorporate caveats, objections to and oversights in the original system
by incorporating them into the functioning of the structure]{.underline}
-- jouissance can easily be read as nothing more than hegemony in this
account without changing the original coordinates of the system too
drastically. Yet, enjoyment provides one particularly difficult
stumbling block for a dedicated formal account. To start with, enjoyment
is never quite as 'achievable' as the preceding quotation might suggest.
[Far from being the consummation of a logic of structure and investment,
[enjoyment is a supplement to a failing in a
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}: for example, Lacan frames jouissance as
a useless enjoyment of one\'s own subjectivity that supplements the
fundamental failings of a subject in either finding a grounding or
consummating an authoritative account of its coherence. This
'uselessness' defines the operation of jouissance. [Thus]{.underline},
for example, [when Lacan suggests that '[language is not the speaking
subject']{.mark}]{.underline} in the Seminar on Feminine Sexuality,
lodging a critique of structural linguistics as a law governing speech,
[[jouissance is]{.mark} understood as something excessive]{.underline}
that is [[born of the failure of]{.mark} structures of
[signification]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lacan 1977). Language is not the
speaking subject precisely because what is passed through the grist mill
of the speech is the result of a misfiring of structure as much as it is
prefigured by logics of structure, meaning and utility. Therefore the
interpretive difficulty for a structuralist account of enjoyment: the
moment that the fact of enjoyment is recoded in the language of
structure, the moment that it is made useful in a logic of
subjectivization is precisely the moment where it stops being
jouissance. Following Glynos and Stavrakakis\'s suggestion, one might
press the question of the relationship between the demand and jouissance
as a way of highlighting the differences that a purely Lacanian reading
of demand might make for Laclau\'s understanding of politics. [Framing
enjoyment as equivalent with hegemony, Laclau identifies the fundamental
'split' in psychoanalytic theory between the universal and the
particular demands of a group. Framing the split in this way, and as the
privileged site of the political, Laclau occludes attention to another
split:]{.underline} namely, [[the split within a subject, between the
one who enters an equivalential relationship and]{.mark} the
[identitarian claim that sutures this subject into]{.mark} a set of
[linkages. This]{.mark} too [is a site of
enjoyment]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} where a subject identifies with
an external image of itself for the sake of providing its practices of
subjectivity with a kind of enjoyable retroactive coherence. The demand
is relevant here, but not simply because it represents and anticipates a
change in the social order or because it identifies a point of
commonality. [Here [the]{.mark} [demand is]{.mark} also [a demand to be
recognized as a subject among other subjects]{.mark}, and given the
sanction and love of the symbolic order. The implication]{.underline} of
this argument about the nature of enjoyment [is that the perverse
dialectic of misfirings, failure and surpluses in identity reveals
something politically dangerous in not moving beyond
demand.]{.underline} Put another way: [not all equivalences are equally
equivalent.]{.underline} [[Some equivalences]{.mark}
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} fetishes, becoming [points of
identification that eclipse [the]{.mark} ostensible political [goal of
the demand.]{.mark}]{.underline} To extend the line of questioning to
its logical conclusion, can we be bound to our equivalential chains?
Freud, Lacan and the demand Demand plays a central role in Freud\'s
tripartite scheme for the human psyche specifically in the formation of
the ego. Although this scheme does not exercise the same hold over
psychoanalytic thinking that it once did, the question of the ego still
functions as an important point of departure for psychoanalytic thinking
as a representative case of the production of the subject and identity.
Even for critics of 'ego psychology', the idea of the ego as a
representation of the 'I' of the human subject is still significant --
the main question is what kind of analytical dispositions one takes
towards the ego, the contingencies of its emergence and its continuing
function. Despite the tendency of some commentators to naturalize
Freud\'s tripartite schema of the human psyche, Freud\'s account of the
ego does not characterize the ego as pre-existent or automatically
given. Although present in virtually every human subject, the ego is not
inevitably present: the ego is a compensatory formation that arises in
the usual course of human development as a subject negotiates the
articulation and refusal of its needs as filtered through demand.
Hypothetically a 'subject' whose every need is fulfilled by another is
never quite a subject: this entity would never find occasion to
differentiate itself from the other who fulfils its every need. As a
mode of individuation and subjectification, egos are economies of
frustration and compensation. This economy relies on a split in the
Freudian demand, which is both a demand to satiate a specific need and a
demand for addressee to provide automatic fulfilment of need generally.
[[The generative power of the demand relies on this split]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} on fact that [some demands will be
refused]{.mark}.]{.underline} This economy of need and frustration works
because refusal of a specific need articulated as a demand on another is
also a refusal of the idea that the addressee of the demand can fulfil
all the subject\'s needs, requiring a set of individuation compensatory
economic functions to negotiate the refusal of specific demands. ['Ego'
is nothing more than the name for the contingent economy of compensatory
subjectification driven by the repetition and refusal of
demands]{.underline} -- the nascent subject presents wants and needs in
the form of the demand, but the role of the demand is not the simple
fulfilment of these wants and needs. [[The demand and its refusal are
the fulcrum on which the identity and insularity of the subject are
produced]{.underline}]{.mark}: an unformed amalgam of needs and
articulated demands is transformed into a subject that negotiates the
vicissitudes of life with others. Put in the metaphor of developmental
psychology, an infant lodges the instinctual demands of the id on others
but these demands cannot be, and for the sake of development, must not
be fulfilled. Thus the logic of the pop-psychology observation that the
incessant demands of children for impermissible objects ('may I have a
fourth helping of dessert') or meanings that culminate in ungroundable
authoritative pronouncements (the game of asking a never-ending 'whys')
are less about satisfaction of a request than the identity producing
effects of the distanciating parental 'no'. In 'The Question of Lay
Analysis', Freud argues: If ... demands meet with no satisfaction,
intolerable conditions arise ... At that point ... the ego begins to
function. If all the driving force that sets the vehicle in motion is
derived from the id, the ego ... undertakes the steering, without which
no goal can be reached. The instincts in the id press for immediate
satisfaction at all costs, and in that way they achieve nothing or even
bring about appreciable damage. It is the task of the ego to guard
against such mishaps, to mediate between the claims of the id and the
objections of the external world. (Freud 1986, p. 22) Later works move
this theory from the narrow bounds of the parent/child relationship to a
broader social relationship which was continually constituting and
shaping the function of the ego -- this is a theme of works such as
Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, as well as Civilization
and its Discontents. The latter repeats the same general dynamics of ego
formation as 'The Question of Lay Analysis', but moves the question
beyond individual development towards the entirety of social relations.
For Freud, the inevitability of conflicts between an individual and the
social whole is simply one of the facts of life among other people. Life
with others inevitably produces blockages in the individual\'s attempts
to fulfil certain desires -- some demands for the fulfilment of desires
must be frustrated. This blockage produces feelings of guilt, which in
turn are sublimated as a general social morality. Here frustration of
demand is both productive in that it authorizes social moral codes, and
civilization as mode of functioning, though it does so at the cost of
imposing a constitutively contested relationship with social mores
(Freud 1989). Though there are many places to begin thinking the
Freudian demand in Lacan, one of the best places to start is an almost
accidental Lacanian rumination on demands. [Confronted by student calls
to join the movement of 1968 Lacan famously quipped: '[as hysterics you
demand a new master: you will get it]{.mark}!' Framing the meaning of
his response requires a treatment of Lacan\'s theory of [the demand and
its relationship to hysteria as]{.mark} an [enabli]{.mark}ng [and
constrain]{.mark}ing [political subject position]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Lacan\'s theory of the demand picks up at Freud\'s movement outward from
the paradigmatic relationships between the parent/child and
individual/civilization towards a more general account of the subjects,
sociality and signification. The infrastructure supporting this
theoretical movement transposes Freud\'s comparatively natural and
genetic account of development to a set of metaphors for dealing with
the subject\'s entry into signification. Lacan\'s goal is to
rearticulate Freudian development processes as metaphors for a theory of
the subject\'s production within signification. In Lacanian terms, what
is at stake in this transposition is a less naturalized account of the
subject by privileging supplementary practices of enjoyment that give a
subject coherence as an agent, not in the sense of an ultimate
ontological grounding, but rather as a mode of enjoying the repetition
of retroactive totalities that name and produce subjects. This process
is most famously worked out in Lacan\'s famous 'Mirror Stage' which
details the trauma of the subject\'s insertion into the symbolic order,
and the way that this constitutive dislocation generates the jouissance
that sustains the production of subjectivity (Lacan 1982a). Looking in
the mirror, Lacan\'s hypothetical infant does not yet have a concept of
a unified self, puzzled by the fact that when it moves the image of the
child in the mirror also moves. From the child in the mirror, Lacan
infers the existence of two 'I\'s underwriting processes of
subjectivization: an 'ideal I', a statuesque projection of what it means
to be an 'I' (in this case the image of the child) and a
phenomenological experience of 'I-ness'. Lacan treats the dialectic of
misidentification in the mirror as a constant and constitutive
performance of subjectivity as opposed to a specific developmental stage
(Wilden 1982). In this interpretation, the child in the mirror stage is
a metaphor for the constant production of the subject as a performance
of the self in relation to a constitutive gap between the Symbolic and
the subject, and the articulation of subjectivity as a category serves
to repress the trauma produced in the margin between a nascent subject,
its alienation from a projected external identity, and within the
structure of signification. The paradoxical effect of this mode of
subject formation is that not only does the child 'discover' that she is
the child in the mirror, it also experiences a disorienting distance
between itself and its image. Despite this fact, the child requires the
an external image such as the one in the mirror to impose a kind of
unity on its experience -- the image of the other child provides an
imaginary framing, a retroactive totality or a kind of narrative about
what it means to be a self. The paradox of subjectivity lies in the
simultaneity of identifying with an image of one\'s self that is given
by a specific location within the symbolic order and the simultaneous
alienation produced by the image\'s externality. Thus, the assumption of
a frame for identity cannot ever completely effective, or, a subject is
never completely comfortable inhabiting subjectivity -- there is always
an impossible gap between an experience of alienated subjectivity, a
prefigured given image of one\'s subjectivity and the experience of
being produced by the Symbolic. There is a famous Lacanian aphorism that
holds that '[the signifier represents a subject for another
signifier']{.underline} (Lacan 1977, p. 142). [This]{.underline}
formulation of the subject\'s relation to language [inverts the
conventional wisdom that ontologically pre-given subjects use language
as an instrument to communicate their subjective intentions. Signifiers
are constituted by their difference, and subjects come into being in
negotiating their entry into this realm of difference.]{.underline}
Instead of articulating subjective states through language, [[subjects
are articulated through language]{.underline}]{.mark}, within the
differential space of signification. The paradoxical implication of this
reversal is that the subject is simultaneously produced and disfigured
by its unavoidable insertion into the space of the Symbolic. The mirror
stage marks the excess of the demand as a mode of subject formation.
Subjects assume the identity as subjects as a way of accommodating to
the demand placed on them by the symbolic, and as a node for producing
demands on the symbolic, or, of being recognized as a subject (Lacan
1982a, p. 4). Here jouissance is nothing more than the useless enjoyment
of one\'s own subjectivity, surplus produced in negotiating a difficult
gap between the phenomenological and ideal 'I\'s, produced by a failure
in relation between Lacan\'s phenomenological I and the Symbolic. Both
the site of subject production and the site where this subject fills out
an identity by investing in equivalential linkages and common demands
are sites of enjoyment. In this sense, perhaps there is an excess of
jouissance that remains even after the reduction of jouissance to
hegemony. This remainder may even be logically prior to hegemony, in
that it is a useless but ritually repeated retroactive act of naming the
self that produces the conditions of possibility for investment, the
defining point for Laclau\'s reduction of jouissance to hegemony. This
specific site of excess, where the subject negotiates the terms on a
non-relationship with the symbolic is the primary site splitting need,
demand and desire. Need approximates the position of the Freudian id, in
that it is a precursor to demand. Demand is the filtering of the need
through signification, but as Sheridan notes 'there is no adequation
between need and demand' (Sheridan 1982). The same type of split that
inheres in the Freudian demand inheres in the Lacanian demand, though in
this case the split does not derive from the empirical impossibility of
fulfilling demands as much as it stems from the impossibility of ever
fully articulating needs to or receiving a satisfactory response from
the Other. Since there is no adequation, the specificity of the demand
becomes less relevant than the structural fact that demand presupposes
the ability of the addressee to fulfil the demand. This impossibility
points to the paradoxical nature of demand: namely that [[the demand
is]{.mark} less a way of addressing need than [a call for love and
recognition by this other.]{.mark}]{.underline} 'In this way', writes
Lacan, 'demand annuls (aufheht) the particularity of everything that can
be granted by transmuting it into a proof of love, and the very
satisfactions that it obtains for need are reduced (sich erniedrigt) to
the level of being no more than the crushing of the demand for love'
(Lacan 1982b, p. 286). [The difficulty is that [the Other
cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}, by definition, [ever [give this
gift]{.mark}]{.underline}: the starting presupposition of the mirror
stage is the constitutive impossibility of comfortably inhabiting the
symbolic -- the mirror stage marks the constitutive split between the
subject and the Symbolic. This paradoxical split, namely the structural
impossibility of fulfilling demands, resonates with the logic of the
Freudian demand in that the frustration of demand produces the
articulation of desire. Thus, Lacan argues that 'desire is neither the
appetite for satisfaction, nor the demand for love, but the difference
that results from the subtraction of the first from the second' (Lacan
1982b, p. 287). How might this subtraction occur? The answer to this
question requires an account of the Other as seemingly omnipotent, and
as simultaneously unable to fulfil demands. This sentiment animates the
crucial Lacanian claim for the impossibility of the other giving a gift
which it does not have, namely the gift of love: It will seem odd, no
doubt, that in opening up the immeasurable space that all demand
implies, namely, that of being a request for love .... Desire begins to
take shape in the margin in which demand becomes separated from need:
this margin being that which is opened up by demand, the appeal of which
can be unconditional only in regards to the Other ... having no
universal satisfaction ... It is this whim that introduces the phantom
of omnipotence, not of the subject, but of the other in which his demand
is installed. (Lacan 1982c, p. 311) [Transposed to the realm of
political demands, this framing of demand reverses the classically
liberal presupposition regarding demand and agency. In the classical
iteration]{.underline} and contemporary critical theories that inherit
its spirit, [[there is a presupposition that]{.mark} a demand is a way
of exerting agency, and that [the more]{.mark} firmly that [the demand
is lodged, the greater the production of an agential effect.]{.mark} The
Lacanian framing]{.underline} of the demand [sees the relationship as
exactly the opposite: [the more firmly one lodges a demand the more
desperately one clings to the legitimate ability of an institution to
fulfil it.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus, [demands ought to reach a kind of
breaking point where the inability of an institution]{.underline} or
order [to proffer a response should produce a re-evaluation of the
economy of demand and desire.]{.underline} In analytic terms, [this is
the moment of subtraction, where the manifest content of the demand is
stripped away and the desire that underwrites it is laid bare. The
result]{.underline} of this 'subtraction' [is that the subject is in a
position to relate to its desire, not as a set of
deferrals]{.underline}, avoidances or transposition, [but rather as an
owned political disposition.]{.underline} As Lacan frames it, this is a
dialectical process, where at each moment the subject is either learning
to reassert the centrality of its demands, or where it is coming to
terms with the impotence of the other as a satisfier of demands: But it
is in the dialectic of the demand for love and the test of desire that
development is ordered .... Clinical experience has shown us that this
test of the desire of the Other is decisive not in the sense that the
subject learns by it whether or not he has a real phallus, but in the
sense that he learns that the mother does not have it. (Lacan 1982b, p.
311) Thus, [desire]{.underline} both [has general status and a specific
status for each subject.]{.underline} In other words, it is not just the
mirror that produces the subject and its investments, but the desire and
sets of proxy objects that cover over this original gap. As Easthope
puts it: Lacan is sure that everyone\'s desire is somehow different and
their own -- lack is nevertheless my lack. How can this be if each of us
is just lost in language ... passing through demand into desire,
something from the real, from the individual\'s being before language,
is retained as a trace enough to determine that I desire here and there,
not anywhere and everywhere. Lacan terms this [objet petit
a]{.underline} ... petit a [is different for everyone; and it can never
be in substitutes for it in which I try to refind it.]{.underline}
(Easthope 2000, pp. 94--95) [[The point]{.underline}]{.mark} of this
disposition [[is to bring the subject to a point where they]{.mark}
might ['recognize and name' their]{.mark} own [desire, and]{.mark} as a
result to [become a political subject]{.mark} in the sense [of being
able to]{.mark} truly [argue for something without being dependent on
the other as a support for or organizing principle for political
identity.]{.mark} This naming]{.underline} is not about discovering a
latently held but hidden interiority, rather it [is about naming a
practice of political subjectivization that is not solely oriented
towards or determined by the locus of the demand, determined by the
contingent sets of coping strategies that orient a subject towards
others and a political order.]{.underline} As Lacan argues, [this is the
point where a subject becomes]{.underline} a kind of new presence, or in
the register of this essay, [a new political possibility: '[That the
subject should come to recognize and to name his
desire]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is the efficacious action of analysis.
But it isn\'t a question of recognizing something which would be
entirely given .... [In naming it, the subject creates]{.underline},
brings forth, [a new presence in the world']{.underline} (Lacan 1988,
pp. 228--229). [Alternatively, subjects can stay fixated on the demand,
but in doing so they forfeit the possibility of desire]{.underline}, or
as Fink argues: 'later, however, Lacan comes to see that [an
analysis]{.underline} ... [that]{.underline} ... [does not go far enough
in constituting the subject as desire leaves him]{.underline} or her
[stranded at the level of demand ... unable to truly
desire']{.underline} (Fink 1996, p. 90). What does this have to do with
hysteria? [A politics defined by and exhausted in demands is
definitionally a hysterical politics. The hysteric is defined by
incessant demands on the other at the expense of]{.underline} ever
[articulating a desire which is theirs.]{.underline} In the *Seminar on
the Ethics of Psychoanalysis*, for example, Lacan argues that [the
hysteric\'s demand that the Other produce an object is the support of an
aversion towards one\'s desire]{.underline}: 'the behavior of the
hysteric, for example, has as its aim to recreate a state centred on the
object, in so far as this object, das Ding, is, as Freud wrote
somewhere, the support of an aversion' (Lacan 1997, p. 53[). [This
economy of aversion explains the ambivalent relationship between
hysterics and their demands]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} On one
hand, [[the hysteric asserts]{.mark} their [agency, even authority over
the Other.]{.mark} Yet, what appears as unfettered agency from the
perspective of a discourse of authority is]{.underline} also
[simultaneously a surrender of desire by enjoying the act of figuring
the other as the one with the exclusive capability to satisfy the
demand.]{.underline} Thus [the logic of 'as hysterics you demand a new
master: you will get it!' At the register of manifest content, demands
are claims for action and seemingly powerful, but at the level of the
rhetorical form of the demand or in the register of enjoyment, [demand
is a kind of surrender]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a relation of address
[hysterical demand is more a demand for recognition and love from an
ostensibly repressive order than a claim for change. The limitation of
the students' call on Lacan does not lie in the end they sought, but in
the fact that the hysterical address never quite breaks free from its
framing of the master.]{.underline} Here [the fundamental problem of
democracy is not in articulating resistance over and against hegemony,
but rather the practices of enjoyment that sustain an addiction to
mastery and a deferral of desire. The difficulty in thinking hysteria is
that it is both a politically effective subject position]{.underline} in
some ways, [but]{.underline} that it [is politically constraining from
the perspective of organized political dissent. If not a unidirectional
practice of resistance, hysteria is]{.underline} at least [a politics of
interruption: [imagine a world where the state was the perfect and
complete embodiment of a hegemonic order, without
interruption]{.mark}]{.underline} or remainder, [and [the discursive
system was hermetically closed. Politics would be an impossibility, with
no site for contest]{.mark}]{.underline} or reappropriation and
everything simply the working out of a structure. [Hysteria is a site of
interruption, in that hysteria represents a challenge to our
hypothetical system, refusing straightforward incorporation by its
symbolic logic. But, [stepping outside this hypothetical non-polity,
hysteria is net politically constraining because the form of the demand,
as a way of organizing the field of political enjoyment requires that
the system continue to act in certain ways to sustain its
logic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, [though on the surface it is an act of
symbolic dissent, hysteria represents an affective affirmation of a
hegemonic order, and]{.underline} therefore [a particularly fraught form
of political subjectivization.]{.underline}

#### This negation exploits the politics of stupidity---an unreadable demand for nothing creates a site for love and solidarity without reproducing our desire for recognition by the Master

**WELTY 2018** (William, PhD Candidate at Rutgers, TOWARDS A POLITICS OF
STUPIDITY, Politics/Letters, May 30,
http://politicsslashletters.org/features/towards-politics-stupidity/)

One of the main issues with the late 20th century model of critique is
its limitation to conceiving of power as prohibition or
proliferation.\[4\] [One of Lacan's major insights was to
recognize]{.underline} this type of [power]{.underline} relation [at
work]{.underline} not just in the discourse about sex or politics, as in
Foucault, but [in [academic]{.mark}]{.underline}, knowledge-based
[[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} in general. Lacan describes such
relations in his Discourse of the University, updating the Hegelian
Master/Slave dialectic to one of Master/Student and demonstrating how
resistance often merely creates new force fields of power. In his
seminar following the 1968 protests in Paris, Lacan admonishes the
student protesters, many of whom were likely in the audience: "As
hysterics, you demand a new master. You will get it!"\[5\] The hysteric
provides an apt starting point for a critique of political protest as a
direct confrontation between protester and power, and uncoincidentally,
is the epithet often hurled at the Left from the Right.\[6\] On one
hand, the hysteric is an unreadable and resistant figure, repulsed by
power (sexual, or otherwise) and fighting hard against it. But
simultaneously, the hysteric desires that the repressive power desires
him/her back. Thus, [in the very act of resistance, this subversive
desire [still desires "a new master]{.mark},"]{.underline} as Lacan
articulately points out. [Isn't this the precise critique made by Angela
Peoples]{.underline} in her now infamous sign at the 2017 Women's March:
"[[Don't forget: White Women voted for Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}"?\[7\]

On her sign, [Peoples]{.underline} invokes a return of the repressed
that combines the legacy of psychoanalysis with the activism of
intersectional feminism. And, she [provides a more nuanced reading of
the situation than Lacan on his own]{.underline} would be capable.
Lacan, or at least Žižek's reading of him, anticipates and critiques a
Foucauldian reading of power: "[What one should avoid]{.underline} here
[is the Foucauldian misreading: the produced subject is not simply the
subjectivity which arises as the result of the disciplinary application
of knowledge-power, but its remainder, that which eludes the grasp of
knowledge-power]{.underline}."\[8\] These two opposed subjectivities map
onto the disagreements over feminism embodied in Peoples' sign: [on one
hand, subjects produced as a result of power, and on the other, those
produced yet excluded as its powerless outside. Subjectivity as
remainder]{.underline}, that which is left over after the productions of
power, is a crucial turn in understanding resistance to power. It
[provides a potential model for resistance that doesn't fall into the
trap of conceiving of power as either purely repressive or productive.
Peoples' resistance]{.underline}, in turn, [avoids a complicit form of
feminism while simultaneously avoiding]{.underline} the apocalyptic
thinking of [a knowledge-based masculine perspective]{.underline}.\[9\]
While this leftover part of subjectivity aligns nicely with what Lacan
calls objet petit a, I want to highlight the farcical aspect of being
out of place, which isn't totally absent from Peoples' posture in the
photo. The dark humor of not fitting in and being unreadable can be
described by what Patricia Gherovici and Manya Steinkole have called
"the new LOL" ( Lacan on Laughter).\[10\]

For Lacan, stupidity can create a movement from discourses of mastery,
like the University, to a state that lacks a lack and is characterized
by enjoyment. He says in Seminar XX, "Knowledge is worth just as much as
it costs \[coute\], a pretty penny \[beau-coute\], in that it takes
elbow-grease, and that it's difficult. Difficult to what? Less to
acquire it than to enjoy it."\[11\] In a capitalist knowledge discourse
based on acquisition, knowledge is easy enough to have; you can just buy
it, or if worst comes to worst, simply make it up. In the "post-truth"
economy, consumers will just acquire whatever knowledge fits their
worldview, whether it is made up or not. However, Lacan's economy is
strictly a non-capitalist one, since knowledge is reduced to exchange
value without surplus-value or profit.\[12\] But what does it mean that
it's difficult to enjoy? Lacan doesn't mean that knowledge, whether real
or alternative facts, can lead to happiness; surely the opposite is
often true, despite how many derive a sort of vulgar enjoyment from the
absurdly made-up tweets and alternative facts coming from the Right. But
to enjoy (jouir) is not about acquisition, and not about not acquiring,
but something "difficult" indeed: to relate to knowledge and the Other
in a way that frustrates such a lack-based economy as such. Stupidity
then is not about having or lacking knowledge (as in ignorance), but
rather learning how to enjoy. Such a difficult enjoyment leads us
through Lacan back to Freud; as Leo Bersani has shown, enjoyment in
Freud is both about having and not having pleasure.\[13\] And since
"jouir" also means "to orgasm" in French, Bersani likewise helps to show
how Freud's notion of drive is both pleasure and unpleasure: as
pleasure, it is something to be acquired, but as unpleasure, it is
something to be dispelled, through orgasm. What a politics of stupidity
forces us to attempt to think is a "knowledge" that, to make a bad pun
on Lacan's jouissance and Derrida's notion of politics, is "to come":
never final, never enjoyed too much, and always in tension.\[14\] Such a
tension aligns stupidity not with the lack of ignorance, but rather with
the almost unbearable presence of the Real.

But now it seems, like the movements of jouissance or the logic of a bad
joke, that we've just gone in a circle. Wasn't stupidity the problem
that led to Trump? Isn't such a politics of stupidity the very opposite
of resistance? Doesn't it run the risk of supporting and propping up the
workings of power, just like Foucault's "repressive hypothesis?" Is it
possible to critique knowledge based discourses while simultaneously
acknowledging those that historically have been marginalized from them?
Instead of mistakenly thinking of speaking out as subversion, perhaps
this thought experiment mistakenly thinks of humor, joking, and
stupidity as subversion. In order to address these concerns, we now turn
to a different trickster, and a non-French one at that: Ishmael Reed.

Ishmael Reed isn't afraid of stupidity, either as an aesthetic or as
subject matter. In fact, he often turns specifically to joking,
clowning, circuses, and stupidity, with his work ranging from detective
stories to westerns, jazz recordings to postmodernist verbal collages.
Using language similar to Lacan, he states in a recent interview, "What
we ended up doing in the sixties was to revolt against the colonial
masters."\[15\] But rather than seeking a new form of mastery, his
stupidity is a specific and often razor-sharp critique of easy answers
and political orthodoxies. His first novel, The Free-lance Pallbearers,
explores the country of HARRY SAM, ruled by a man of the same name: a
former used-car salesman who governs from a toilet, since "he has not
been seen since the day thirty years ago when he disappeared into the
John with a weird ravaging illness."\[16\] (Reed anticipates Alec
Baldwin's Trump toilet tweeting joke by nearly 50 years.) The main
character Bukka works as an orderly cleaning up bedpans ("Make-um-shit
Doopeyduk"), and when he is eventually recruited to participate in
political activist art, he protests "I'm not an actor. I'm more of a
clown" (4, 107). The artist's response? "Good \[....\] So are we, tweet,
tweet. See you soon" (107). (Again, more tweeting.) In his second novel,
Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down, a western about a voodoo cowboy named The
Loop Garoo Kid, Reed satirizes orthodox "political" art in the form of
Bo Shmo and the neo-socialist realist gang. The Kid sneers at their idea
that "All art must be for the end of liberating the masses," and instead
asks, "What's your beef with me Bo Shmo, what if I write circuses? No
one says a novel has to be one thing. It can be anything it wants to be,
a vaudeville show, the six o'clock news, the mumblings of wild men
saddled by demons."\[17\] (Again, Reed is ahead of his time, with
fiction subsuming the nightly news.) Reed's most well known novel, Mumbo
Jumbo, follows the "anti-plague" Jes Grew as it "ravages" the U.S. in
the 1920s, causing energy, feelings of good health, an interest in
Haitian culture, and uncontrollable dancing in the streets. The secrets
of Jes Grew are bound in an ancient secret text called The Work; but as
the title of the novel suggests, the Work isn't a book that contains
practical knowledge. In fact, Papa LaBas, the novel's main character and
VooDoo detective, is never able to read the Work. But that's fine with
him; he concludes, "We will make our own future text."\[18\] Reed's
stupidity, then, is never content with a final answer, even when that
answer comes from one of Reed's own books. Instead, his clowning, like
Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s theory of "signifying" derived from readings of
Reed, is always premised on revision and on future action and future
texts.\[19\]

But how does such stupidity actually work? Isn't this just yet another
instance of vulgar postmodernist critique? While Reed's complex work
escapes such an easy criticism, stupidity does seems to work best by
pointing out a lack in ideological arguments that appeal to some
ultimate truth. But politics and criticism aren't so simple anymore, if
they ever were. As Latour reminds us, "the danger \[of the present\]
would no longer be coming from an excessive confidence in ideological
arguments posturing as matters of fact---as we have learned to combat so
efficiently in the past---but from an excessive distrust of good matters
of fact disguised as bad ideological biases!"\[20\] In other words,
isn't stupidity now precisely the problem instead of a critical
solution?

At best, [[the stupidity of]{.underline}]{.mark} a figure like [[Trump
doesn't seem to be a major issue for]{.underline}]{.mark} many of his
[[supporters]{.underline}]{.mark}; as I write this, polls show his
approval rating among Republicans is still in the 80s. At worst, some of
the most prominent praises of Trump take on precisely these postmodern
terms: Trump as the one who "tells it like it is" and reveals "facts" as
"bad ideology"; as a "blockage" to the "corrupt" system of Washington;
as the big Other or subject-supposed-to-know with no desire and no
stable content, who creates desire in the (conservative, middle class,
white) subject. As such, he is a figure who is stupid, not just in the
traditional sense, but also in Lacan's: by lacking any lack whatsoever,
and thriving politically not through policy or reason, but through
desire and revealing the lack in others (Josh Marshall calls this a
"domination by denigration" strategy.\[21\]) Furthermore, much of the
direct moments of critique to Trump -- [[criticisms of his
"policies]{.mark},"]{.underline} debates, media interviews -- [[have
proved unsuccessful]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least in preventing his
rise to power. During the election, such resistance seemed to only
galvanize him as a figure fighting against the "liberal elite," i.e.
those with knowledge. And even though his approval ratings have fallen
drastically, there are still [[millions]{.underline}]{.mark} who
[[persist in]{.underline}]{.mark} an enjoyment of his lack of knowledge:
not only an enjoyment of ignorance, but also a [[sadistic enjoyment at
the suffering of those harmed by Trump's
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[22\] Again, as Latour has pointed out,
[[direct resistance runs the risk of becoming caught up in the
system]{.mark} of dominance]{.underline}. For an example, we need look
no further than how "Black Lives Matter" has been co-opted in a precise
Foucaultian reformulation of the biopolitical "Make Live and Let Die" --
that is to say, "All Lives Matter." (A declaration of sovereignty so
important that Trump repeated it during his acceptance of the Republican
Presidential nomination.)

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps, like fire-fighting fire, [[stupidity
can combat stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the point I wish to
turn to in the following section. But first, it should be declared
emphatically that this line of argument should in no way minimize the
forms of direct resistance that many have already undertaken. Black
Lives Matter and other activist groups are doing extremely important
work in leveling grass-roots public critiques. Indeed, in the past year,
we have seen how these direct resistances have begun to affect the Trump
White House. Rather, this thought experiment is an attempt, to borrow
more of Latour's militaristic rhetoric, to open up an additional front
in this battle; I wonder how tactics of stupidity might translate into
the knowledge based discourses of Academia or the journalist media,
which have seemed somewhat powerless to speak truth to power against the
Right.\[23\]

By way of beginning such translation, I want to highlight a moment of
[[unreadability]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[created]{.mark} a direct and
[effective critique]{.mark} of Trump]{.underline}, and one
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} importantly [[doesn't pit knowledge against
stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}, or truth against falsity. I'm referring
here to Johari Osayi Idusuyi's protest at a Trump rally in Nov. 2015,
where she simply sat behind Trump while reading a copy of Claudia
Rankine's Citizen. Idusuyi functions as both Lacanian blockage and as
unreadable presence: a bit of the Lacanian Real.\[24\] She is present at
least seemingly as a compliant supporter. Furthermore, she is often
literally unreadable on camera precisely because she is reading with a
book obscuring her face. And unlike the other protesters at the rally,
who attempted to directly confront Trump and his supporters and were
violently ejected, Idusuyi instead merely exists (or "persists," to
borrow McConnell's "critique" of Elizabeth Warren) within the space of
the rally. But through such existence, she makes all the Trump
supporters around her visibly uncomfortable and distracted, yet unsure
precisely how to respond to this woman calmly reading. Indeed, Rachel
Maddow referred to Idusuyi as an "unbowable presence," and this is
precisely what the type of political subjectivity I am trying to
theorize: an unreadable yet unbowable presence, one that functions by
both blocking the discursive system and refusing to be made a part of
it. This "stupidity" is a far cry from ignorance; in Lacan's terms, [it
is]{.underline} instead [a lack of a lack]{.underline}.\[25\]

Inside the book that Idusuyi was reading, Claudia Rankine tackles many
of these same issues: presence, lack, black bodies, and alternative
forms of knowing. Her poetry, like Idusuyi's presence, is also often
filtered through screens; the book contains reproductions of images from
YouTube videos and sports matches. Reflecting on Hennessy Youngman's
YouTube performance pieces, which "\[suggest\] black people's anger is
marketable," she writes,

You begin to think, maybe erroneously, that this other kind of anger is
really a type of knowledge: the type that both clarifies and
disappoints. It responds to insult and attempted erasure simply by
asserting presence, and the energy required to present, to react, to
assert is accompanied by visceral disappointment: a disappointment in
the sense that no amount of visibility will alter the ways in which one
is perceived.\[26\]

While not specifically theorizing stupidity or clowning like Reed,
Rankine negotiates a complex and dialectical form of knowledge: one that
combines thinking with error and transforms nouns and feelings into
verbs and actions, and vice versa. In so doing, she sublates "this other
kind of anger" into a new form of knowledge, one that both "clarifies"
and further muddies the waters. But that is precisely the point. This
anger/knowledge is not valuable because of its clarification,
correspondence, or truth-value --- it's not a form of "alternative
facts" --- but rather because of its simply being there. The
knowledge-as-presence that Rankine creates inside the book perfectly
complements the presence-as-knowledge created by Idusuyi at the Trump
rally. Of course, this knowledge isn't simply utopian; it might not make
a difference in "the ways in which one is perceived." Rankine continues
in the next paragraph: "Recognition of this lack might break you apart.
Or recognition might illuminate the erasure the attempted erasure
triggers. Whether such discerning creates a healthier, if more isolated,
self, you can't know" (24). The poetic recognition of lack as breakage
in Rankine is a very real concern for protesters, who risk the literal
breaking of their bodies in the fight to be recognized. But what Rankine
holds out is a hope that such erasure might lead to more erasure: that
lack might create its own lack in return. Indeed, "recognition" and
"illumination" and "erasure" all become so mixed up that ultimately,
"you can't know." But in that space of not-knowing --- of attentiveness
to the Other's desires and our own lacks of the perfect answers ---
perhaps a politics of stupidity can begin.\[27\]

Reflecting on the melancholia of critique, and the deadlock of the Left
and the Right more generally, [[this new type of
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark} --- characterized by stupidity, humor, and
"unbowable presence" --- [[is an urgent **political and ethical
necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The resistor must realize that, along
with Foucault, "We must not think that by saying yes to sex \[and other
prohibitions\], one says no to power."\[28\] But I would like to add
here that [[we can't just shout "No!"]{.underline}]{.mark} any longer
either (though we should definitely keep doing that too). In addition,
[[the political subject]{.mark} with unknowable]{.underline} "clownlike
[integrity" [must resist through]{.mark}]{.underline} her very
[[unreadable presence ̶ and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [**[through the
very act of reading]{.mark}**]{.underline} too. We can thus draw a
direct line from the "unsuccessful" protests of Occupy Wall Street in
2011-2012, through the demands of Bernie Sanders, all the way to the
recent Women's Marches in Washington, D.C. Ishmael Reed's "Future Text"
ends up written by the bodies of the protestors; isn't the galvanization
of the Left to take to the streets just like the "enlivening"
anti-plague Jes Grew, "electric as life and \[...\] characterized by
ebullience and ecstasy" (6)? In shifting perspectives, many of the
critiques against these protesters --- that they are lazy and should get
jobs, that they aren't articulating coherent demands, that their bodies
aren't really oppressed --- are reformulated into the precise form of
their resistance. As Rankine writes about tennis judge Mariana Alves'
notoriously bad (and seemingly racist) calls against Serena Williams,
"Though no one was saying anything explicitly about Serena's black body,
you are not the only viewer who thought it was getting in the way of
Alves's sight line" (27). Once again, she theorizes a form of literally
unspoken knowledge that is found in the presence of a body as an
obstruction to the dominant, white "sight line." Lacan might even call
such an obstruction the gaze. And as both Rankine's book and Idusuyi's
presence make clear, such a form of knowledge is present through
reading.

In response to a President who tweets and doesn't read, the unreadable
presences of these readerly bodies in the streets is the perfect
political response. For Lacan, in the final stage of his dialectic of
desire, the subject confronts the lack in the big Other; when asked
"What do you want of me?", the big Other responds with "Nothing." The
protests against Trump reverse the terms. We might imagine a new slogan
chanted at the next march:

**[["What do we want?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[["Nothing!"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[["When do we want it?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[["NOW!"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Of course, there are numerous literal demands that the protesters are
fighting for. But such a demand for nothing is not without precedent.
[Radical [abortion rights activists]{.mark} in the 1960s [presented the
New York legislature with **a blank piece of paper as their proposed
bill**, the implication being that their bodies should not be regulated
by laws in any way]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[29\] [[This posture of
negativity]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[locates power not in the figure
of a new master, but in the bodies of the protestors themselves]{.mark}.
Thus, [demand takes the form of a lack of a lack]{.mark}]{.underline},
but more importantly, of [a demand]{.underline} and a lack [that isn't
going away]{.underline}: one that obstructs "sight lines" through its
"unbowable presence."

Slavoj Žižek has termed this type of resistance "passive violence," in
response to the debate about whether it was OK to punch neo-Nazi Richard
Spencer. (Žižek says no.)\[30\] But notwithstanding the schadenfreude of
such violence, I have tried to shift the locus of passive violence to
stupidity, like the clowning of Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer. In so
doing, I would also shift terms, both Žižek's and my own from the early
version of the paper: moving from active compliance to active, present
stupidity. Kate McKinnon's Kellyanne Conway, from the March 4th, 2017
Saturday Night Live, perfectly represents such a shift: instead of jokes
or sketches, her character merely appears at brief moments throughout
the broadcast, sitting in a red dress and playing with her phone, a
perfect parody of the infamous "couchgate" photo of the real life
Conway.\[31\] This isn't a joke per se: nothing is said, and McKinnon
just repeats the same things that Conway did. But in so doing, she also
enacts the same gesture of stupidity that ties these many disparate and
complex forms of political resistance together as obstructive presence:
from Reed's Loop Garoo Kid to Claudia Rankine, or from Johari Osayi
Idusuyi to Melissa McCarthy. These disparate forms of stupidity return
us, full circle, to Marx's notion of history: first as tragedy, then as
farce. Of course, we can't overlook the complex histories and
differences that inform these different acts of resistance.\[32\] But,
taken together in a moment of contingency and solidarity, perhaps the
different histories might lead to [[a politics not only of stupidity,
but]{.mark} ultimately togetherness: a [togetherness that recognizes
difference and the unreadability of the Other, but also how that
presence can still belong]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [[Lacan's
primary example for]{.underline}]{.mark} silliness,
[[stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}, and nonsense [[is
love]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[33\] Or as Rankine says towards the close of
her book, "You smile dumbly at the world because you are still feeling
if only the feeling could be known and this brings on the moment you
recognize as desire" (153).

#### Decide on questions of form prior to content- their adherence to the global capitalist form renders content vacuous

**Gržinić 12** \[Marina Gržinić, another Ljubljana analyst, *Biopolitics
and Necropolitics in relation to the Lacanian four discourses*,
September 2012, //Stefan\]

[[Global capitalism]{.mark} has at its core a mechanism that
[simultaneously produces and eschews content]{.mark}, [leaving us with
an empty form -- a performative repetitive mechanism]{.mark} so self
conscious [that]{.mark} it [neutralizes any revolutionary potential of
the content]{.mark}]{.underline}. This mechanism, as I call it,
(discussed in more detail below), will help us understand what it is
that makes more or less all large contemporary exhibitions and projects
obsolete in terms of resistance and critique (though they are not
obsolete for those who organize, curate and take part in them). To put
it another way: what we have today, especially in big powerful
exhibition projects (biennials, documentas, manifestas, etc.), are [a
myriad of [artworks that present as content unbelievable features of
contemporary capitalist exploitations and expropriations]{.mark}; these
'features' are [more and more visible]{.mark}]{.underline}, artists show
it all, tout court[, [without any mediation.]{.mark} These]{.underline}
art exhibitions present artworks that [show capitalist corruption,
police repression, massacres of people and animals, all made visible
with more and more drastically elaborated dimensions, reasons,
[connections of exploitation, expropriation,
executions]{.mark}]{.underline}: but all remain impotent. Even as it is
presented, [[the content is simultaneously made obsolete]{.mark} through
a repetitive performative mechanism that functions as [a process of
extracting meaning,]{.mark} in the sense of voiding or
emptying.]{.underline} These forms of performance present and
encapsulate [a process [of emptying]{.mark}]{.underline} (not only of
diminishing, but in many cases completely nullifying) what at the level
of content was made visible. [In the past, social reality was presented
as 'normal' on the level of content. Therefore on the level of
the]{.underline} (art) [form, it was necessary to produce something
'abnormal']{.underline} -- something as a formal invention or as an
excess, as an excessive surplus (in accordance with the social and
political system in which it appeared, be it socialism or capitalism) --
in order to say that what was commonly accepted as 'normality' was in
fact a lie. But what we have today is precisely the obverse; [[on the
level of content the world is captured as it is]{.mark}, in all its
dimensions of abnormality, monstrosity, exploitation, expropriation,
while [on the level of form, this abnormality is normalized and
presented in such a way that the power and meaning of extreme content
becomes empty, obsolete.]{.mark} Thus [content becomes abnormal while
the form is normal.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, the form is being so
snobbishly stylized, so to speak, that it is going out of all
proportion. I want to say that [t[he performativity with which the form
is acknowledged]{.mark} in its representation [undermines any
possibility of critical meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}; this is what I
mean by '[performative repetitive mechanism]{.underline}'. In such a
situation, the knowledge that is 'captured' through scientific or
artistic work is transformed through a performative politics of
repetition into [a purely ideological artefact]{.underline}, but with
the proviso that the performativity of the process absolves us from the
responsibility of seriously considering it. As a result, what we get is
not just an upside (turned) down, but ideology made again 'unconscious'
and presented in the form of a game or joke that is given a life of its
own. If we follow Althusser's definition of
[i[deology]{.mark}]{.underline}7 [as [a deformed representation of the
imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of
existence]{.mark}]{.underline} (by which he meant the relations of
production), then [what ideology misrepresents today is not reality, but
itself. It behaves as a cognizant post-Fordist mechanism that takes the
presented operation of ideology's materiality as its raw material, as
its content.]{.underline} But what does this mean, precisely? Today,
[art makes imaginary what was already identified as material; through
the repetitive performative ideological mechanism, it translates the
materiality of ideology and its apparatus onto imaginary levels. [The
materiality of ideology is made redundant, nullified and emptied through
repetitive]{.mark}]{.underline} (ideological) [[performative
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}. To put it another way[, what is clear
and self-evident on the level of content is, on the level of form, made
to be]{.underline} obsolete, ridiculous, not sexy or attractive enough,
[not obvious enough. The materiality of ideology is treated as raw
material to be integrated in performative representations where this
materiality is consciously relegated to the level of the
imaginary.]{.underline}

(p. 129). The author makes very broad claims about this function of
democracy, which is \'the most pressing task\' of politics (p. 60), the
only way to ensure permanent creation of the new (p. 60) and the only
legitimate form of hegemony (p. 256). [The argumentation backing up

arrangement of jouissance . Instead of the fantasies pervasive today,
typified by their blaming of the other for the incompleteness of the
self, Stavrakakis proposes a passage to feminine jouissance that
encircles the lack (pp. 22-23, 111, 144, 268, 278-279). Present
democracies have been hit by an assault on the two pillars of modern
democracy \-- equality and liberty \-- by the neoliberals and
neoconservatives, respectively, leading to a \'post-political\' world in
which conflict is avoided and thus returns as social problems, and in
which a new, almost pre-democratic despotism is taking shape (pp.
263-264). Despite this, democracy can still function as \'the mobilising
force, the common denominator, for a politics of alternatives\' (p.
258). [These political conclusions are dubious]{.underline}. Liberal
democracies in fact tend to be quite closed to change and to be
supplemented with aggressive nationalist and racist identities. The
liberal state, like the authoritarian state, tends to essentialize
itself as a form in such a way as to deny its own contingency. It is not
clear that the radical democratic framework guarantees basic rights or
prevents the state from making essentialist claims on others.
Stavrakakis assumes that the democratic form itself directly achieves
the goal of recognizing contingency (p. 141). Yet this cannot be the
case, since as Stavrakakis admits, this form does not prevent actually
existing democracies from being inflected with fantasmatic projects such
as ultranationalism, or degenerating into a \'post-political\' disavowal
of conflict. Further, whichever party gets in power \-- by majority will
or procedural hitch \-- is generally able to ignore intransigent
realities, pursue its own fantasmatic actings-out and repress,
foreclose, disavow or otherwise silence whatever forms of social
otherness are not to its tastes. Beyond this, there is a fantasmatic
frame of the liberal-democratic state that pits the permanent
institutions such as the police, bureaucracy and secret service against
semi-permanent Others, hence displacing real social antagonisms into
narratives of \'crime\', \'disorder\', \'terrorism\', \'madness\',
\'anarchy\' and so on. [Can this fundamental fantasy be traversed
without **shattering the frame of the**]{.underline} \'democratic\'
**[state itself?]{.underline}** One might also wonder if the \'politics
of alternatives\' has not already emerged \-- and passed by entirely the
radical democrats \-- in the form of the anti-capitalist and
anti-neoliberal movements. [The linking of Lacanian theory to liberal
democracy seems just too convenient. One cannot but be reminded of the
Soviet-era dissidents whose critiques of the **existing regimes** ended
up **reproducing** them in **their** proposed
**alternatives**]{.underline} \-- [hence operating as the fantasmatic
supplement of the regimes themselves]{.underline}. Surely a full
acceptance of social contingency would generate social relations
radically different from those pertaining in a society where such
acceptance has not occurred. Acceptance of contingency might, for
instance, necessitate the elimination of punishment, which involves a
fantasy frame blaming the other (the criminal) for social conflict and
risk; it would instead require that risk be assumed by all social actors
and not displaced into special \'exceptional\' spaces. It would seem to
imply that the state needs to be constrained from the outside by other
institutions, that a social order where power is negotiated or contested
among multiple institutions is better than one where a single site
monopolizes the field of social power. Or maybe it would be better
served by the fluidity of affinity and the looseness of custom than by
the fixity of state and law. Perhaps the revival of activities
inscribing agonism and difference emerge, not inside the state, but in
societal relations, oppositional movements and everyday life. While the
Lacanianism of the title is self-explanatory, it raises another problem
\-- why the \'left\' in \'Lacanian left\'? Stavrakakis defines \'left\'
as meaning a democratic legitimation of antagonism and \'alternatives\'
(p. 30), a definition that begs the question, identifying the \'left\'
directly with Lacanianism. This is pretty much unrecognizable in
relation to general usage, in which \'left\' is generally associated
with the welfare or self-assertion of the worst-off, and the
prioritizing of substantive social issues over property, propriety and
order. Is Lacanian theory really \'left\' in this more usual sense? It
is, on Stavrakakis\'s own admission, \'subversive\' rather than
\'revolutionary\' (pp. 2, 158) and has a \'reformist direction\' (p.
109). What this means in concrete terms is that the structural frame is
taken as unchangeable but the elements within it can be reshuffled.
\'Exclusion and antagonism may be unavoidable, but acknowledging this
does not restrict our ability to influence their particular
articulations, to displace continuously the limits they impose\' (p.
226). Again in common with other \'radical democrats\', Stavrakakis says
little to reassure either the excluded or included of the present that
they will not be the losers of such a reshuffling; it is unclear as to
who will be excluded in this process, and indeed, if any one exclusion
can be deemed ethically worse than any other. At best it is possible
that the presently marginalized could come out on top from such
reshuffling. However, this is not the main aim of Lacanian theory, which
has more to do with the recognition of contingency, rejection of
\'utopianism\' and defence of liberal-democratic regimes \-- of the
\'situationness\', or ordering as such, of society, along with its
\'eventness\' or the recurrence of radical acts (pp. 156-157). This
leads to assertions of the need for hierarchical power. For instance,
authority is taken as inevitable in all social situations; it is \'a
frame presupposed in every social experience\' (p. 173). \'Without
someone in command reality disintegrates\' (p. 174). Such an orientation
has a long history, but it is a history of the right, not the left,
associated particularly with anti-communist liberals such as Popper,
Kolakowski and Berlin, and traceable to the classical liberalism of
authors such as Jefferson, de Tocqueville and J.S. Mill, who viewed
constitutionality, political pluralism and a competitive \'marketplace
of ideas\' as necessary to impede the totalitarian tendencies of any one
perspective taken alone. Contingency, anti-utopianism, a humble
acceptance of limits to knowledge and action, the primacy of lack in
human experience, are all paralleled in this older tradition.
\<\<\<Continues next page\>\>\> The strengths and weaknesses of the text
largely follow from the usefulness and limits of the perspective it
provides. [The Lacanian perspective]{.underline}, as a partial truth,
[certainly provides interesting insights and a different way of
seeing]{.underline}, and [as such often generates productive
contributions]{.underline}. However, [it fails drastically to understand
the **partiality of its own \'truth\'**]{.underline}. In Stavrakakis\'s
words, lack can\'t be signified but it can be formalized (p. 279). In
other words, a final map of the structure of reality can still, from
this perspective, be drawn \-- and has been drawn already by Lacan. In
effect, the [result is a claim to be the theoretical end of]{.underline}
[history \-- all else is utopian, essentialist and so on.]{.underline}
In many respects, [the perspective is also reactive]{.underline},
[defined by what it is against]{.underline} (anti-essentialist,
anti-utopian, anti-fantasmatic). **[It is less clear what it is
for]{.underline}** \-- although the idea of feminine jouissance begins
the task of constructing a positive pole. [Its relation to the other is
**very intolerant** and dismissive. It is not open to other voices
because it is always ready to judge the other as failing its own rigid
internal criteria. It expresses a dangerous urge to drive the other out
of the community]{.underline} of speakers, [and perhaps out of
existence]{.underline} altogether. The chapter on Castoriadis is
symptomatic here. Castoriadis in many ways stands for the entire field
of horizontalist radicalism \-- horizontalists and immanentists
(Stirner, Reich, Negri, Deleuze, Marcuse, various critics of Lacan)
circle around the text like barbarians at the gates. The dispute between
Lacanianism and horizontalism is a dispute the stakes of which Lacanians
are reluctant to confront, instead hiding behind the view from one side
\-- \'they disagree with us, therefore they are wrong\'. Except that
\'wrong\' is usually replaced by one of a number of theoretical epithets
\-- romantic, utopian, essentialist \-- which sound superficially like
useful categories of theory but which are never defined and which serve
mainly as a name to call people who disagree with one or another basic
Lacanian assumption. The impression is given that those who hold these
perspectives are somehow naïve, intellectually disreputable or
unrespectable, but this connoted claim is never demonstrated. It is
simply a choice of one perspective over another, conveyed in loaded
language. Like most of its ilk, [this book does plenty to show what
Lacanian theory does]{.underline}, how it \'works\' as a theoretical
machine or toolkit, [but rather less to say why it should be preferred
to other approaches]{.underline} (assuming, of course, that not wanting
to be called names is insufficient reason to accept its validity).
[Lacanian theory suffers from an **ontological and epistemological
restrictiveness** derived from its absolutizing of structural
topologies, which **limits its explanatory power** by rendering far too
many]{.underline} specificities of metropolitan statist [societies
\'necessary\']{.underline} or \'unavoidable\'. [The theory
involves]{.underline} restrictive, [totalizing claims that are **neither
logically**]{.underline} necessary **[nor empirically
demonstrated]{.underline}**; most often, [acceptance]{.underline} of
such claims [is unnecessary to gain the benefits of the
explanatorily]{.underline} or theoretically [useful aspects]{.underline}
of the perspective. [Social phenomena vary in how well they fit this
limiting frame. Nationalism and racism]{.underline}, having the right
form, [fit well, and hence become favourite expository
targets]{.underline} for Lacanian theorists. [But dogmas will have to be
sacrificed if a broader **field of social movements** is to be
encompassed]{.underline}.

## Psycho bad

#### Psycho bad - Psychoanalysis has always been weaponized against abolitionist groups and radicals and used to minimize the impact of their work -- John Brown, William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Weld prove -- empirics

**Rothbard 6** (Murray N. Rothbard was an economist at the Austrian
school, historian, economist, and political theorist. "Psychoanalysis as
a Weapon". Mises Daily Articles. Oct 13 2006.
[[https://mises.org/library/psychoanalysis-weapon]{.underline}](https://mises.org/library/psychoanalysis-weapon)
solenne)

[Psycho-history has most often been used as a weapon against radical
groups in the past**. [Any radical group that challenged the status quo
is assumed ipso facto to be crazy or neurotic, people whose ideas and
behavior have to be \"explained]{.mark}**[.\"]{.mark} The
\"explanation\" of course is never that they had perceived what they
considered to be a grave injustice in society and were trying to set it
right. Whether their theory of justice is correct or not is really
beside the point]{.underline}. [The point is that the [psycho-historian
has always implicitly assumed that the status quo,]{.mark} whatever it
is, [is normal]{.mark}, so [that opposition to it is neurotic]{.mark}
and abnormal and needs \"explanation.\"]{.underline} **[[The leading
example of this]{.mark} smear of radicals through psychologizing [has
been the]{.mark} conventional historians\' [treatment of
abolitionists]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} a treatment that has only
been modified in recent years[. **[In setting themselves]{.mark}
squarely and openly [against]{.mark} what they considered the monstrous
[injustice of slavery, the abolitionists, especially the militant
Garrisonian wing, let themselves in for psycho-historical abuse]{.mark}
as well as vilification during their lifetime.** Thus, [the popular
textbook]{.mark} by Hofstadter, Miller, and Aaron [refers to William
Lloyd Garrison as \"wayward\" and \"neurotic.]{.mark}\" Hazel C. Wolf,
in her revealingly titled work, [On Freedom\'s Altar, the Martyr Complex
in the Abolition Movement, describes the abolitionist Theodore Weld as
someone who \"gloried in the persecution he suffered]{.mark},\" and who
\"lovingly wore the martyr\'s crown of thorns.\" [As for]{.mark} poor
[Garrison, \"he had a mania for uniqueness and attention.\"]{.mark}
Perhaps the basest rhetoric--to use Szasz\'s stirring term--was [David
Donald\'s]{.mark} outrageous and patently untrue a[ssertion that the
abolitionists were dismayed at the freeing of the slaves because it
ended a crusade which had brought them \"purpose and joy\"]{.mark};
Lincoln as emancipator was for them \"the killer of the dream.\" To wrap
it up, Professor Donald manages to smear the abolitionist and
laissez-faire Senator Charles Sumner as impotent and latently
homosexual, and to conclude that \"This holy blissful martyr thrived
upon his torments.\"5 [The base message]{.mark}]{.underline} in all this
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** clear. [[Radicals who see injustice in the
status quo are neurotic; if they are persecuted,]{.mark} who cares, for
after all [that\'s what they]{.mark} really [wanted]{.mark}; and whether
or not they achieved their goals doesn\'t matter because [they
cared]{.mark} not about the goal but [only about the trouble-making
struggle itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 [Blaming radicals for their own
persecution is akin to another reversal tactic frequently practiced by
Freud.]{.underline} Thus, in one of my favorite works of Tom Szasz--the
unfortunately neglected Karl Kraus and the Soul Doctors--Szasz writes of
Freud\'s response when one of his entourage, Fritz Wittels, delivered a
psychoanalytic \"character assassination\" (as Szasz correctly calls it)
of Freud\'s brilliant critic, Karl Kraus. Freud\'s reaction was that
\"we have reason to be grateful to Wittels for making so many
sacrifices.\" On which Szasz comments: This is one of Freud\'s
characteristic verbal tricks, which he often applied to his own attacks
on others as well; it is not Kraus who was sacrificed by Wittels, but
Wittels who has sacrificed himself[! It is a good tactic if one can get
away with it, and, by and large, Freud got away with it]{.underline}.7
[Of all the abolitionists, the most hated and denounced as neurotic or
psychotic by psycho-historians was the most radical of the lot, John
Brown. Brown not only denounced slavery, he took up arms against it; in
doing so, he killed people. To denounce war or killing as neurotic or
psychotic per se would condemn a large portion of the human race, past
and present]{.underline}. Moreover, [Brown]{.underline} was grim and had
no sense of humor. He [spoke of slavery as a sin, and of the necessity
of \"purging this land with blood.\" But then, all the evangelical
pietists of the day spoke in similar terms]{.underline}. They--and this
means the bulk of the Protestant sects in the Northern United States
from 1830 or so onward--were deeply religious, and they believed it
their bounded duty for their own salvation to do their best to \"make
society holy\" and to \"purge this land of sin.\" Most evangelical
pietists were grim, humorless folk, and their definition of sin
unfortunately went far beyond a libertarian hostility to slavery; Demon
Rum, gambling, the breaking of the Sabbath, and membership in the Roman
Catholic Church stood, in their eyes, as almost as sinful as slavery,
and once slavery was out of the way, most of them determined to use
force, if necessary, to purge the land of these activities too. So, as I
said earlier, none of these people, not Garrison, and certainly not John
Brown, would have made charming cocktail party companions. But this does
not make them \"neurotic\" or \"sick\"; just passionate and determined
men who found sin and injustice, some in areas where I would agree and
other where I would emphatically disagree. [Neither does John Brown\'s
raid on Harper\'s Ferry qualify him as a nut because the raid manifestly
failed. Brown\'s raid was based on cogent theories of guerrilla
warfare]{.underline}, and particularly on a plan set forth a year
earlier by the libertarian Lysander Spooner. [The idea was to get arms
in a dramatic and much-publicized raid, and then to go off into the
hills to form what we would now call guerrilla foco in the South, which
would attract runaway slaves, and which could be used as a base for
guerrilla raids upon slaveholders, either freeing numbers of slaves or
holding the masters as hostages and forcing them to set the slaves
free.8]{.underline} [Generally, [radicals are dismissed by
psycho-historians as people with Oedipal problems]{.mark}, people [who,
in their unresolved hostility to \"the father,\" are lashing out at the
State]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} at [contemporary institutions]{.mark}.
Fortunately, however, [psychoanalysis also provides us with]{.mark} a tu
quoque, or \"you\'re another,\" weapon as [a
counter-punch]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[For radicals can always retort:
\"No. You, in defending the State and the current status quo, are
neurotically attached to your father!\"]{.mark} [Both]{.mark} sets of
nonsense, it seems to me, [cancel each other out,]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
then we can all turn to substantive matters. **[The availability of this
counter-thrust is part of the methodological weakness that
psychoanalysis shares]{.mark} with other determinist creeds** For all
determinist beliefs implicitly assume that the determinist is magically
exempt from the determined system and that he, at least, possesses free
will and the ability to learn the truth.**.**]{.underline}

#### Psychoanalysis is ultra-extremist---cannot be used as an interrogation of the political and doesn't solve for anything

afre

[Can we bring some order to this host of criticisms]{.underline}? It is
remarkable **that**, for all the criticisms of Žižek's political
Romanticism, no one has argued that [the ultra- extremism of Žižek's
political position might refl ect his untenable attempt to shape his
model for political action on the curative fi nal moment in clinical
psychoanalysis]{.underline}. The [differences between these two
realms]{.underline}, listed in Figure **5**.1, [are nearly too many and
too great to restate]{.underline} -- which has perhaps caused the
theoretical oversight. The key thing is this. [Lacan's notion of
traversing the fantasy involves the radical transformation of people's
subjective structure: a refounding of their most elementary beliefs
about themselves, the world, and sexual difference]{.underline}. This is
undertaken in the security of the clinic, on the basis of the
analysands' voluntary desire to overcome their inhibitions, symptoms and
anxieties. As a clinical and existential process, it has its own
independent importance and authenticity. The
**[analysands]{.underline}**, in transforming their subjective world,
change the way they regard the objective, shared social reality outside
the clinic. But they **[do not transform the world.]{.underline}** [The
political relevance of the clinic can only be (a) as a supporting moment
in ideology critique or (b) as a fully- fl edged model of politics,
provided that the political subject and its social object are ultimately
identical]{.underline}. Option (b), Žižek's option, rests on the idea,
not only of a subject who becomes who he is only through his (mis)
recognition of the objective sociopolitical order, but whose 'traversal
of the fantasy' is immediately identical with his transformation of the
socio- political system or Other. Hence, [according to Žižek, we can
analyse the institutional embodiments of this Other using psychoanalytic
categories]{.underline}. In Chapter 4, we saw Žižek's resulting elision
of the distinction between the (subjective) Ego Ideal and the
(objective) Symbolic Order. [This leads him to analyse our entire
culture as a single subject--object, whose perverse (or perhaps even
psychotic) structure is expressed in every manifestation of contemporary
life]{.underline}. Žižek's decisive political- theoretic errors, one
substantive and the other methodological, are different (see Figure 5.1)
The substantive problem is to equate [any political change]{.underline}
worth the name with the total change of the subject--object that is,
today, global capitalism. This is a type of change that [can only mean
equating politics with violent regime change, and ultimately embracing
dictatorial government]{.underline}, as Žižek now frankly avows (IDLC
412--19). We have seen that [the ultra- political form of Žižek's
criticism]{.underline} of everyone else, the theoretical Left and the
wider politics, [is that no one is suffi ciently radical for
him]{.underline} -- even, we will discover, Chairman Mao. We now see
that this is [because Žižek's model of politics proper is modelled on a
pre- critical analogy with the total transformation of a subject's
entire subjective structure, at the end of the talking
cure]{.underline}. For what could the concrete consequences of this
governing analogy be?  [We have seen that Zizek equates the individual
fantasy with the collective identity of an entire people. The social
fantasy, he says, structures the regime\'s \'inherent
transgressions\']{.underline}: at once subjects\' habitual ways of
living the letter of the law, and the regime\'s myths of origin and of
identity. [If political action is modelled on the Lacanian cure, it must
involve the complete \'traversal\']{.underline} - in Hegel\'s terms, the
abstract versus the determinate negation - of all these lived myths,
practices and habits. Politics must involve the periodic founding of of
entire new subject--objects. Providing the model for this set of ideas,
the first Žižekian political subject was Schelling's divided God, who
gave birth to the entire Symbolic Order before the beginning of time
(IDLC 153; OB 144--8). But [can the political theorist reasonably hope
or expect that subjects will simply give up on all their inherited
ways, myths and beliefs, all in one world- creating moment? And can they
be legitimately asked or expected to, on the basis of a set of ideals
whose legitimacy they will only retrospectively see, after they have
acceded to the Great Leap Forward? And if they do not -- for Žižek
laments that today subjects are politically disengaged in unprecedented
ways -- what means can the theorist and his allies use to move them to
do so?]{.underline} Žižek, as ever, does not shrink from drawing the
only possible conclusion: the politics of the Act is a politics of
voluntaristic, groundless or 'divine' violence (IDLC 162). [Biting the
pessimistic bullet, Žižek2 indeed maintains that all political power
(and even all speech itself) is tainted with 'obscene
violence']{.underline} (IDLC 378; OV 58--72; PV 307) [This is an
extrapolation]{.underline} of his claim that there is no Law and
Symbolic Order without the superego, which we saw in Chapter 4. It is a
repackaging [of]{.underline} the [(neo)conservative]{.underline}, later
Freudian, [position on civilisation's ineradicable
discontents]{.underline}, [whose bleakness invites us to wonder how any
power could be legitimated as better than any othe]{.underline}r. So it
is understandable that Žižek has attracted the critical charge that he
is a Schmittian 'ultra- politician': someone who militarises politics.
Tellingly, his only response is to argue that, while the 'Right'
externalises political confl ict into war, the 'Left' accepts that confl
ict rives societies from within: this is class struggle. So
[Žižek]{.underline} does not give any ground, as we will see, on the
equation of politics with potentially violent confl ict between
competing 'concrete universals'. It is as if he [believes not in
draining the Zuider Zee of irrational drives, but in learning to swim in
it better than the antagonist can]{.underline}. Žižek's move is to go
from describing politics as based on traversing the fantasy to resting
his model for revolutionary agency on the later Lacan's diffi cult
notion that the end of the cure involves identifying with the sinthome.
Notably, like Freud's later notion of the intractable death drive, this
sinthome responds to the later Lacan's pessimism about the power of the
talking cure. As per Žižek's critique of Stavrakakis above, it names an
unmediatisable, unchanging 'knot' of Jouissance. It lies at the
subject's most singular, idiosyncratic heart: an exceptional or
'extimate' mode of enjoyment that it can neither traverse nor publicly
avow. When Žižek2 applies this to the political subject--object, the
sinthome turns out to be those whom Žižek calls 'proletarian': groups
who represent the 'part of no- part' (IDLC 428; PV 268). Although they
are parts of the existing order, they are absolutely unrecognised and
excluded from the rest of the expressive totality. As we saw above,
Žižek thinks our sinthome today are the slum- dwellers and other
lumpenproletariat that mass at the gates of the global order's great
cities (IDLC 424--6).

#### Even if they win superior explanatory power, psychoanalytic imaginings are useless in advancing political change

**Rosen-Carole 10** Adam, Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Bard
College, 2010, "Menu Cards in Time of Famine: On Psychoanalysis and
Politics," Psychoanalytic Quarterly, Vol. LXXIX, No. 1, p. 205-207

On the other hand, though in these ways and many others, psychoanalysis
seems to promote the sorts of subjective dispositions and habits
requisite for a thriving democracy, and though in a variety of ways
psychoanalysis contributes to personal emancipation--- say, by releasing
individuals from self-defeating, damaging, or petrified forms action and
reaction, object attachment, and the like---in light of the very
uniqueness of what it has to offer, one cannot but wonder: **[to what
extent]{.underline}**, if at all, **[can]{.underline}** the habits and
dispositions---broadly, the forms of life---cultivated by
**[psychoanalytic practice]{.underline}** survive, let alone
**[flourish, under]{.underline}** modern social and **[political
conditions? If the]{.underline}** emancipatory
**[inclinations]{.underline}** and democratic virtues that
psychoanalytic practice promotes **[are]{.underline}** systematically
[**crushed**]{.underline} or at least regularly unsupported by the world
in which they would be realized, then **[isn't
psychoanalysis]{.underline}** implicitly **[making promises it cannot
redeem?]{.underline}** Might not massive social and political
transformations be the condition for the efficacious practice of
psychoanalysis? And so, under current conditions, can we avoid
experiencing the forms of life nascently cultivated by psychoanalytic
practice as something of a tease, or even a source of deep frustration?
(2) Concerning psychoanalysis as a politically inclined theoretical
enterprise, **[the worry is whether political]{.underline}** diagnoses
and **[proposals]{.underline}** that proceed **[on]{.underline}** the
basis of **[psychoanalytic insights]{.underline}** and forms of
attention **[partake of a fantasy of]{.underline}** interpretive
**[efficacy]{.underline}** (**[all the world's a couch]{.underline}**,
you might say), wherein our profound alienation from the conditions for
robust political agency are registered and repudiated? Consider, for
example, Freud and Bullitt's (1967) assessment of the psychosexual
determinants of Woodrow Wilson's political aspirations and impediments,
or Reich's (1972) suggestion that Marxism should appeal to
psychoanalysis in order to illuminate and redress neurotic phenomena
that generate disturbances in working capacity, especially as this
concerns religion and bourgeois sexual ideology. Also relevant are
Freud's, **[Žižek's]{.underline}** (1993, 2004), Derrida's (2002) and
others' insistence that we draw the juridical and political consequences
of the hypothesis of an irreducible **[death drive]{.underline}**, as
well as Marcuse's (1970) proposal that we attend to the weakening of
Eros and the growth of aggression that **[results from]{.underline}**
the coercive [**enforcement of the reality principle**]{.underline} upon
the sociopolitically weakened ego, and especially to the channeling of
this aggression into hatred of enemies. Reich (1972) and Fromm (1932)
suggest that psychoanalysis be employed to explore the motivations to
political irrationality, especially that singular irrationality of
joining the national-socialist movement, while Irigaray (1985) diagnoses
the desire for the Same, the One, the Phallus as a desire for a
sociosymbolic order that assures masculine dominance. Žižek (2004)
contends that only a psychoanalytic exposition of the disavowed beliefs
and suppositions of the United States political elite can get at the
fundamental determinants of the Iraq War. Rose (1993) argues that it was
the paranoiac paradox of sensing both that there is every reason to be
frightened and that everything is under control that allowed Thatcher
"to make this paradox the basis of political identity so that subjects
could take pleasure in violence as force and legitimacy while always
locating 'real' violence somewhere else---illegitimate violence and
illicitness increasingly made subject to the law" (p. 64).
[**Stavrakakis**]{.underline} (1999) **[advocates that we]{.underline}**
recognize and **[traverse the]{.underline}** residues of **[utopian
fantasy]{.underline}** in our contemporary political imagination.1 Might
not the psychoanalytic **[interpretation of powerful
figures]{.underline}** (Bush, Bin Laden, or whomever), collective
subjects (nations, ethnic groups, and so forth), **[or]{.underline}**
urgent **["political" situations register]{.underline}** an
**[anxiety]{.underline}** regarding political impotence or "castration"
that is pacified and modified by the fantasmatic frame **[wherein the
psychoanalytically inclined]{.underline}** political **[theorist
situates]{.underline}** him- or herself **[as diagnosing]{.underline}**
or interpretively intervening in the lives of political figures,
collective political subjects, or complex political
**[situations]{.underline}** with the idealized efficacy of a successful
clinical intervention? If so, then the question is: **[are the
contributions of psychoanalytic]{.underline}**ally inclined political
**[theory anything more than tantalizing menu]{.underline}** cards
**[for meals it cannot deliver]{.underline}**? As I said, the worry is
twofold. These are two folds of a related problem, which is this: might
the very seductiveness of psychoanalytic theory and
practice---specifically, the seductiveness of its political
promise---register the lasting eclipse of the political and the
objectivity of the social, respectively? In other words, **[might not
everything that makes psychoanalytic]{.underline}** theory and
**[practice]{.underline}** so politically **[attractive
indicate]{.underline}** precisely the necessity of wide-ranging
social/institutional **[transformations that far exceed the powers of
psychoanalysis?]{.underline}** And so, might not the politically salient
**[transformations]{.underline}** of subjectivity **[to which
psychoanalysis can contribute overburden subjectivity as
the]{.underline}** site of **[political transformation, blinding us

It is at this point that I wish to draw back and resist the temptations
of both postmarxism and postmodernism. And it is also at this point that
I wish to return to my second concern with this particular historical
conjucture of May \'68. I have emphasised the rapprochement that took
place between Marxism and psychoanalysis post 1968 but what I have
omitted from the discussion thus far is that these were but two of a
much broader and more complex **alliance**, an alliance that was
informed, above all, by feminism as well as a wide ranging critique of
philosophical foundationalism and the politicised semiotics of Barthes
and Kristeva. [Psychoanalysis, and this is for me where it ties back to
questions of pedagogy, was but one amongst a number of discourses and it
was the specific conjuncture of these distinct discourses that created
the critical space within which they operated.]{.underline} Furthermore,
[the political dimension of this project was not the practice of
theoretical discourse per se but rather the intervention of theoretical
discourse in the terrain of ideology]{.underline}. For instance, it is
not simply a case of how to teach psychoanalysis in the University that
is the issue of this conference but \'what\' we are teaching with it. If
**[psychoanalysis creates a radical, critical and destablising
space]{.underline}** within the Universities (and if it doesn\'t I see
no point in teaching it), then it does so, I believe, **[in conjunction
with other discourses]{.underline}**. [Psychoanalysis is not the answer
but the problem and what is at stake is the political implications of
psychoanalytic theory and practice]{.underline}. I will come back to
this in my concluding remarks. What I now want to do is to restage this
debate and attempt to forestall what I identified above as the
theoretical and political impasse of post-marxism in the light of the
possibility of a psychoanalytic theory of ideology. For if
psychoanalysis has anything to offer political theory in general or the
politics of representation in particular it is in the field of ideology.
[According to Zizek the psychoanalytic theory of ideology has
regressedsomewhat from Althusser\'s first exploratory
steps]{.underline}. Let me be quite clear here, I do not see Althusser
as the final word in this debate. His reformulation of the Marxian
concept of ideology as the imaginary representation of the subjects real
conditions of existence was notoriously under-theorised, just as his use
and understanding of Lacan was seriously questionable. What I want to
suggest is more modest, that is, that Althusser mapped a certain
problematic of the subject, representation and ideology that we remain
within but now all too often seek to evade or obfuscate[. I now seem to
read a great deal, for instance, about subjectivity and representation
but very little about ideology and the political implications of, say,
multiple subject positions, or, the subject in
process.]{.underline} Zizek articulated this problem succinctly in The
Sublime Object of Ideology, when he suggested that the elision of the
Althusserian/Lacanian debate masked a deeper problematic. To quote
Zizek: There is something enigmatic in the sudden eclipse of the
Althusserian school: **[it cannot be explained away in terms of a
theoretical defeat. - It is more as if there were]{.underline}**, in
Althusser\'s **[theory, a traumatic kernel which had to be quickly
forgotten, \'repressed\', it is an effective case of theoretical
amnesia]{.underline}**. This \'traumatic kernel\' is, for Zizek, that
impossible encounter with the Real, whilst that effective moment of
theoretical amnesia, I want to argue, is the political. The critique of
the Althusserian position is now well established and in my view
substantively correct, so I will restrict myself to those criticisms
which pertain to Zizek\'s work, principally Althusser\'s failure to
successfully think through the relationship between his ideological
apparatuses and the interpellation of individuals as ideological
subjects. Briefly, Althusser never theorised how the ideological
structures he identified were internalised by subjects and,
furthermore, Althusser failed to account for the fact that his
interpellated subjects were always already ideological subjects in the
same sense that they had been subjected to prior
subjectification[.]{.underline} According to Zizek, therefore,
Althusser\'s error was to locate ideology in the wrong order. For
Marxism ideology is always a question of consciousness, or, more
precisely of false consciousness. For Zizek, however**[, ideology does
not work at the level of consciousness but rather below
it]{.underline}**, - it is not an illusion masking reality but a
fundamental misrecognition at the level of social reality itself. As
Zizek puts it: [The illusion is not on the side of knowledge, it is
already on the side of reality itself, of what people are doing. What
they do not know is their social reality itself, their activity, is
guided by an illusion, by a fetishistic inversion]{.underline}.**11**
What Zizek calls the ideological fantasy unconsciously structures our
social reality. Such an account of ideology, I might add, is not
in-itself inconsistent with certain variants within Marxism. What
psychoanalysis adds to the situation is an insistence on the structural
necessity of the failure of ideological interpellation. **[The
internalisation of ideological structures can never fully succeed,\...
\... there is always a residue, a leftover, a stain of traumatic
irrationality and senselessness sticking to it,]{.underline}** and that
this leftover, far from hindering the full submission of the subject to
the ideological command, is the very condition of
it.11 **[Ideology]{.underline}**, then, **[is not an illusion which
masks social reality]{.underline}**. On the contrary, **[it is a
fantasy-structure which serves to support that very reality and thereby
to mask a more intractable impossible real kernel]{.underline}**. The
function of ideology\', writes Zizek, \'is not to offer us a point of
escape from our reality but to offer us the social reality itself as an
escape from some traumatic, real kernel\'.13 Zizek\'s manoeuvre is
significant and I believe opens the way for a properly psychoanalytic
theory of ideology. What he highlights is not only the bad faith of
ideology, its imaginary illusory dimension, but also its pleasure, that
inseparable and unaccountable element of surplus-enjoyment on which the
function of ideology hinges. Indeed, it is the very aim of ideology to
conceal the element of surplusenjoyment proper to the ideological form.
There is in Zizek\'s formulation, then, a certain compensatory exchange.
We are not merely duped into believing that this is the best of all
possible worlds, that there is no alternative, but gain something in a
very \'real\' sense. That is, in the sense of what Zizek identifies as
the radical ambiguity of the real as both a non-symbolized kernel that
returns and disrupts the symbolic and at the same time as contained in
that very symbolic form, as \'immediately rendered by this form\'.14 It
is this notion of radical ambiguity in relation to the aim and function
of ideology that I want to hang onto and to attempt to link up with a
second aspect of Zizek\'s theory.

## death drive fails

#### Even Freud doubted the death drive.

known for his work on Sigmund Freud and the history of psychoanalysis.

Freud grew very attached to his new dualism, especially the death drive,
later admitting that \"I can no longer think in any other way\" (1930: I
19) . As he put it in BPP: \"We make this assumption \[about the
existence of a death drive\] thus carelessly because it does not seem to
be an assumption\" (192oa: 44).Years later, he would bluntly mock those
who rejected the death-drive theory, echoing Goethe\'s line that:
\"little children do not like it\" when there is talk of the inborn
human inclination to \"badness,\" to aggressiveness and destructiveness,
and so to cruelty as well. God has made them in the image of His own
perfection; nobody wants to be reminded how hard it is to reconcile the
undeniable existence of evil .. . with His all-powerfulness or His
all-goodness. (1930: 120) [Despite Freud\'s commitment to the death
drive, it is true that at times he gave the appearance of being less
dogmatic about it than about some other innovations during his long
career. This tolerant side perhaps reflects Freud\'s ambivalence about
the theory]{.underline}, especially in the beginning, but it is more
likely a good example of his seductive style of argumentation:
rhetorically [he admits the weakness of his]{.underline} (manifest)
[arguments]{.underline} the better to substantiate his (latent)
position. For example, about his new speculations Freud qualifies in BPP
that \"[I am not convinced myself and . . . do not seek to persuade
other people to believe in them]{.underline}\" (192oa: 59). Elsewhere in
this work Freud [even cautions his reader to \"consider or dismiss
\[what follows\] according to his individual predilection]{.underline}\"
(24). It is possible that by this time 16 THE HETEROGENEOUS \'BEYOND\'
THE HETEROGENEOUS \'BEYOND\' 17 in his career Freud realized that he was
not entirely free to adjust his creation to fit his personal fancies;
[psychoanalysis had evidently become a hard piece of a shared
reality]{.underline}. Confronted by disciples who were often, as Martin
Peck aptly puts it, \"More Freudian than is Freud himself\" (1930: 53),
Freud was more than ever inclined to smooth the way into his new views.
[As he concedes at one point, much of his essay is \"speculation, often
far-fetched speculation]{.underline}\" (192oa: 24). That
[Freud]{.underline}, at least on the surface, initially [doubted his own
commitment to the innovations of BPP]{.underline} led Jones to suggest,
a bit dubiously, that \"[while writing]{.underline} it [Freud had no
audience in mind beyond himself]{.underline}\" (1957: 266; cf. de
M\'Uzan 1977). 2In a letter of June 16, 1920, to Max Eitingon, Freud
admits that \"many people will shake their heads over it\" (in Jones
1957: 4o). It is also true that in later years Freud continued to dampen
the enthusiasm that his followers occasionally showed for the
\"findings\" of BPP. In a letter of June 17, 1937, to Princess Marie
Bonaparte, [Freud writes]{.underline}: \"Please do not overestimate my
remarks about the destructive instinct. [They were only tossed off and
should be carefully thought over if you propose to use them
publicly]{.underline}\" (in Jones 1957: 465). [Freud even suggests that
BPP]{.underline} had become too popular and, for that reason,
[was]{.underline} probably [wrongheaded]{.underline}. In a letter to
Eitingon, March 27, 1921, [Freud writes]{.underline} with his
characteristic irony, \"For Beyond I have been sufficiently punished. It
is very popular, is bringing me lots of letters and expressions of
praise. [I must have done something very stupid there]{.underline}\" (in
Schur 1972: 343). \"On this last point,\" historian Ronald Clark
chortles, \"he may have been right\" (1980: 432). If [Freud himself
could express public and private caution about the death drive, both
during and after its inception,]{.underline} we cannot be surprised that
his speculative revisions were often rejected by many observers,
including his most loyal followers. For Wilhelm Reich, although [the
death drive]{.underline} began as a tentative hypothesis, it \"was not
only not given up---it [led to nothing good]{.underline}. Some analysts
even contend that they have direct evidence of the death instinct\"
(1952: 232, n. i). Reich has a point. According to Ferenczi, Freud
himself came to believe that epilepsy \"express\[ed\] the frenzy of a
tendency to self-destruction\" (1929: 102); and Ferenczi, always the
eager disciple, thought he could corroborate this mistaken idea
(102-103). It is understandable that [more commentators rejected than
accepted Freud\'s theory]{.underline}. In a typical assessment, William
McDougall concludes that [Freud\'s notion of a death drive is \"the most
bizarre monster of all his gallery of monsters]{.underline}\" (1936:
64).Years later Ernest Becker would echo this sentiment, concluding that
[the death-drive theory \"can now be securely relegated to the dust bin
of history\"]{.underline} (1973: 99; cf. Sulloway 1979: 394). On the
other hand, like so much Freudian theory, the idea of a death drive
seems immune to criticism. An untestable piece of mythology, it has
entered popular psychology just as assuredly as the \"Freudian slip.\"
It is, for example, often recalled when thoughts turn to the Second
World War. In a recent article in the New Yorker, novelist John Updike
states \"that this disagreeable mythology, proposed in 1932 \[sic\],
gathered credibility as Hitler rose to power the next year\" (1996: 64).
As the French analyst JeanBertrand Pontalis rightly suggests, \"It is as
though the metaphors of Beyond the Pleasure Principle have become, fifty
years later, those of our culture\" (1981a: 193). If Freud\'s
revisionism was hard to accept among his followers, this was in part
because they were less free to fiddle with psychoanalysis than Freud was
himself. As Freud\'s colleague, the Italian analyst Edoardo Weiss, put
it: \"We wonder how Freud would have reacted had another analyst reached
these modified concepts before he did himself\" (1970: 13). Many
analysts did not expect or appreciate that the sixty-three-year-old
Freud, apparently bored during the war years, had single-handedly
renovated the analytic kitchen. As Freud states in a letter of July 8,
1915, to his American supporter James Jackson Putnam: \"I myself am
using the break in my \[clinical\] work at this time to finish off a
book containing a collection of twelve psychological essays\" (Freud
1960: 103). The changes in psychoanalytic doctrine came at a time when
the old views had finally gained some currency amongst the paying
public. By the 1920\'s psychoanalysis was internationally recognized,
Freud himself was famous, and business was improving. Many of the early
radicals of psychoanalysis---including an assortment of outsiders,
dilettantes, and social misfits---had been replaced by more
conservative, even opportunistic, practitioners. It was with this
lattermost thought in mind that Freud and his Viennese colleagues
regularly questioned the motives of American doctors looking, so it
seemed, for quick training that they would sell to the highest bidder
back home. In the wake of the First World War, the unstable European
economy was not an ideal context for changing a winning business
formula. Moreover, it was generally felt that [the problems of sexuality
were the primary business of a psychoanalytic science---not
death,]{.underline} which was traditionally the province of literature
and philosophy.

#### The death drive is a ridiculous theory to justify irresponsibility and insensitivity---proves the alt is a bad

[Freud\'s]{.underline} contempt for, and [insensitivity to,]{.underline}
such [human suffering was sometimes shocking]{.underline}, as Roazen
amply demonstrates in Brother Animal. To Lou Andreas-Salome, who was
once Tausk\'s lover, Freud poured his venom: \"I do not really miss him
\[Tausk\]; I had long taken him to be useless, indeed a threat to the
future\" (in Roazen 1969: 140). Elsewhere [Freud writes,]{.underline}
\"Despite appreciation of his talent, [\[I have\] no real sympathy in
me]{.underline}\" (Freud and Ferenczi 1996: 363).We find a pattern here.
Sachs recounts a time when he observed Freud as \"the news came that
someone with whom he had been on friendly terms for years had committed
suicide. I found him 34 THE HETEROGENEOUS \'BEYOND\' strangely unmoved
by such a tragic event\" (1945: 147). [Clearly Freud could be callous,
if not cold-hearted]{.underline}. According to Sandor Rado, who was with
Freud when the news of Karl Abraham\'s death came,\"Freud\'s mourning
was over after five minutes\" (in Roazen and Swerdloff 1995: 9o). In any
case, Blumenberg seems to support Roazen\'s contention that [Freud\'s
theoretical formulation of a death drive was really a way of denying
responsibility for Tausk\'s suicide]{.underline}. He writes: \"Of course
the [death instinct]{.underline} had its own logical force in the
development and completion of Freud\'s total myth; but the point in
time, so close to a catastrophe \[Tausk\'s suicide\] in which Freud was
involved in so many ways, may also have [suited his need for
consolation, a need that the new dualism of the system of instincts
could satisfy]{.underline}\" (1985: 95). For Blumenberg, then, [the
\"myth\" of psychoanalysis \"becomes helpful to the survivor, as a means
of exempting himself from traumatic impact.\"]{.underline} Even more
tantalizing is his suggestion that \"the success of Freud\'s myths is
the result of, among other things, the fact that they are the most
complete guidelines to the formulation of excuses that have been offered
since Origen.\" [The death drive became for Freud a repository into
which he could dump everything that didn\'t fit well in the categories
of sexuality or libido]{.underline}. [It was]{.underline}, in effect, [a
\"rhetorical strategy,\" whereby blame and responsibility could be
assigned always elsewhere]{.underline} (Kerr 1993: soo). At the same
time, cut off from any referent save itself, [the death drive became
increasingly]{.underline} less autobiographical or biological; in short,
it became efficient and [silent, sublime and ridiculous]{.underline}. 12
[It was, in short, a principle without example]{.underline} (see Deleuze
and Guattari 1972: 332). [Take, for instance, the clinical viability of
the death-drive theory]{.underline}, the most scandalous instance being
that of the \"negative therapeutic reaction.\" [According to this bit of
remarkable double-think, a patient]{.underline} (or rather, a part of
the patient\'s ego) [may be under the impress of an overly severe
superego--- the purveyor of the death drive---and thus be singularly
responsible for the failure of the therapy]{.underline}. \"People in
whom this unconscious sense of guilt is excessively strong betray
themselves in analytic treatment by the negative therapeutic reaction
which is so disagreeable from the prognostic point of view\" (1933a:
109). In other words, while blame, just like aggression, might
theoretically fall on one of two shoulders---analyst\'s or
patient\'s---it was in practice dispensed to \"bad\" patients alone as
the burden of an emotional and/or intellectual failure, weakness, or
symptom. Or worse, it became a part of their biology, a constitutional
problem. As Wilhelm Reich quite properly complained, [the death drive
thus did away with the necessity for considering the sociological side
of neurotic disorders]{.underline}: THE HETEROGENEOUS \'BEYOND\' 35 Such
formulations have made any further thinking unnecessary. [If one was not
able to cure, the death instinct could be blamed]{.underline}. When
people committed murder, it was in order to go to prison; when children
stole, it was to obtain relief from a conscience that troubled them. I
marvel today at the energy that was expended at that time on the
discussion of such opinions. (1952: 213) If resignation is at the bottom
of the mystery of the new drive, the historian of psychology Daniel
Burston adds that it was also \"[a confession of impotence in the face
of the baffling complexities of mental illness]{.underline}\" (1991:
199). If the devil is behind the bad conscience of the repentant
Christian, [Freud obviously finds a new place for him in his psychology:
first in the Inferno he called the unconscious, then in the death drive
he called demonic, and finally in the superego he called repressive and
overly harsh]{.underline}. But in each case, and in any case, the devil
was for Freud always on the side of the patient. And for one absolutely
unimpeachable reason: Freud himself couldn\'t have been in the wrong.

#### **Freud is a pessimist -- he was influenced by war and death -- death drive was imply a coping mechanism.**

If I have already taken small steps away from theory proper by
introducing the broad cultural-political-personal context within which
psychoanalysis was produced and consumed, biographers and historians
have taken it much further down this sometimes provocative and almost
always bumpy road. Certainly Freud\'s own far-reaching speculations have
encouraged others, with some justification, to do the same in their own
work. As David Bakan puts it, \"If a great man writes what appears to be
nonsense, as [Freud\'s writings on the death instinct]{.underline} have
sometimes been regarded even by psychoanalysts, it [behooves us to look
again to see what might lie underneath the facade]{.underline}\" (1966:
155; cf. Jones 1957: 278). It is rather significant, I think, that
Freud\'s most speculative and abstract text is widely thought to have
another, far more subjective, side. Yet this is true of the entire
Freudian corpus, which is deeply autobiographical. It is often
forgotten, at times conveniently, by those who traffic exclusively in
psychoanalytic theory, that Freud was thinking of his dissidents Jung,
Adler, Stekel, and Reich, among others---when he wrote on paranoia, the
Schreber case, The Rat Man, the history of psychoanalysis, world
prehistory and anthropology, civilization and its discontents, group
psychology, interminable analyses, and so on. [Theorists with two hands
in the philosophic pot have had difficulty paying adequate attention to
what may seem the all too human, base considerations of a biographical
history;]{.underline} theorists tend to keep their hands clean of the
messy details of everyday life, even as they shy away from clinical
\"discoveries\" and \"evidence.\" [Still, it is theoretically naive and
a bit ironic when commentators of psychoanalysis ignore the unbreakable
continuity between Freud\'s work and his life or, more radically,
between fantasy and reality, autobiographical theory and biographical
histories.]{.underline} Each side, if there are indeed discernable
sides, inflects and disrupts the other. In their varied attempts to
fashion life histories from dry facts and dates, Freud biographers have
often advanced a subjective interpretation of Beyond the Pleasure
Principle (see Jones 1957: 44; Robert 1964: 323 -38) . Of paramount
concern in this regard are the ominous events of the First World War, a
time when the Freuds suffered privations at home and worried about their
soldier-sons, Ernst and Martin. Certainly the **[war reinforced Freud\'s
pessimistic view of mankind, which led directly to his
essays]{.underline}** \"Thoughts for the Times on War and Death\" (1915)
and \"On Transience\" (1916). In a letter to Fredrick van Eeden in late
1914, [Freud openly laments the pitiable state of human
nature]{.underline}: [I venture, under the impact of the war to remind
you \[that\] . . . the primitive savage and evil impulses of mankind
have not vanished in any of its individual members. . . . Our intellect
is a feeble and dependent thing, a plaything and tool of our instincts
and affects. . . .You will have to admit that psychoanalysis has been
right in both its theses. (19151): 301-302]{.underline} (appendix); see
also Freud and Andreas-Salome 1966: 21) During this same period, as Ilse
Grubrich-Simitis (1987: 77) suggests, [Freud would engage in an \"almost
cheerful war imagery\" in his writing]{.underline}, especially in his
personal correspondence. Freud wrote to Ferenczi on December 15, 1914,
about his metapsychological efforts during that time:\"I am living, as
my brother says, in my private trench; I speculate and write, and after
hard battles have got safely through the first line of riddles and
difficulties\" (Freud and Ferenczi 1996: 36). But [however much Freud
adapted to]{.underline} the new [situation]{.underline}, it is likely,
as both Bruno Bettelheim and Erich Fromm contend, that [the war
disturbed Freud\'s attachment to the]{.underline} old Austro-Hungarian
[empire]{.underline}. Fromm even argues that [the war \"constitutes the
dividing line within the development of Freud\'s theory of
aggressivity\"]{.underline} (1973: 44o; cf. Burston 1991: 197). [Freud
began to write]{.underline} [B]{.underline}eyond the
[P]{.underline}leasure [P]{.underline}rinciple [not long after the
war]{.underline}, in March 1919, completing it by the middle of July
1920 and publishing it with the International Psychoanalytic Press by
the end of the year. In January 1920 Freud\'s friend, colleague, and key
financial supporter Anton von Freund succumbed to cancer. Although
Freund\'s death was expected, Freud writes that it was \"for our cause,
a heavy loss, for me a keen pain, but one I could assimilate in the
course of the last months\" (in Gay 1988: 391). With this admission in
mind, some suggest that [Freud \"assimilated\" the pain of Freund\'s
illness and death into his new theories of that time]{.underline}. As
Gay suggests of Freud, \"work was also a way of coping\" with life\'s
hardships (39o). Only a few days after Freund\'s death, on January 25,
1920, Freud\'s favored \"Sunday child,\" Sophie Halberstadt, died of
influenzal pneumonia. To his friend, the Swiss pastor and lay analyst
Oskar Pfister, [Freud writes that]{.underline} Sophie\'s [death was \"a
heavy narcissistic insult]{.underline}.\" During Hilda Doolittle\'s
(H.D.\'s) analysis with Freud from 1932 to 1933, she recalled the
Spanish influenza of 1920, which she, unlike Sophie, had managed to
survive (and with child). Freud openly lamented to H.D. the loss of his
daughter:\" \'She is here,\' he said, and he showed me a tiny locket
that he wore, fastened to his watch-chain\" (Doolittle 1974: 128).
[Freud]{.underline} understandably thought it monstrous for a parent to
outlive a child; years later he [seemed relieved when his own mother
finally died, thus clearing the way for his own (guilt-free)
death.]{.underline}

Over the past decade, [the "cult of irrelevance" in political science
scholarship]{.underline} has been lamented by a growing chorus (Putnam
2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009). [Prominent scholars of
i]{.underline}nternational [affairs]{.underline} have diagnosed the
roots of the gap between academia and policymaking, [made the case for
why]{.underline} [political science research is valuable for
policymaking]{.underline}, and offered a number of ideas for enhancing
the policy relevance of scholarship in international relations and
comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010;
Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building
on these insights, several initiatives have been formed in the attempt
to "bridge the gap."2 Many of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate the findings and
[implications]{.underline} [of]{.underline} their [research to the
policymaking community, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric]{.underline}.
Yet enhancing communication between scholars and policymakers is only
one component of bridging the gap between international affairs theory
and practice. Another crucial component of this bridge is the generation
of substantive research programs that are actually policy relevant---a
challenge to which less concerted attention has been paid. The dual
challenges of bridging the gap are especially acute for graduate
students, a particular irony since many enter the discipline with the
explicit hope of informing policy. In a field that has an admirable
devotion to pedagogical self-reflection, strikingly little attention is
paid to techniques for generating policy-relevant ideas for dissertation
and other research topics. Although [numerous articles and conference
workshops are devoted to the importance of experiential and
problem-based learning]{.underline}, [especially through techniques of
simulation that emulate policymaking processes]{.underline} (Loggins
2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012; Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014), little
has been written about the use of such techniques for generating and
developing innovative research ideas. This article outlines an
experiential and **[problem-based approach to developing a political
science research program using scenario analysis]{.underline}**. It
focuses especially on illuminating \[**[illuminates]{.underline}**\] the
research generation and **[pedagogical benefits]{.underline}** of this
technique by describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era
Foreign Policy Conference (NEFPC), **[which brings together doctoral
students of international and comparative affairs who share a
demonstrated interest in policy-relevant scholarship]{.underline}**.3 In
the introductory section, the article outlines the practice of scenario
analysis and considers the utility of the technique in political
science. **[We argue that scenario analysis should be viewed as a tool
to stimulate problem-based learning]{.underline}** for doctoral students
and discuss the broader scholarly benefits of using scenarios to help
generate research ideas. The second section details the manner in which
NEFPC deploys scenario analysis. The third section reflects upon some of
the concrete scholarly benefits that have been realized from the
scenario format. The fourth section offers insights on the pedagogical
potential associated with using scenarios in the classroom across levels
of study. A brief conclusion reflects on the importance of developing
specific techniques to aid those who wish to generate political science
scholarship of relevance to the policy world. What Are Scenarios and Why
Use Them in Political Science? [Scenario analysis]{.underline} is
perceived most commonly as a technique for examining the robustness of
strategy. It [can immerse decision makers in future states that go
beyond conventional extrapolations of current trends, preparing them to
take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves
from adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[Scenario analysis]{.underline} [is]{.underline} thus [typically seen as
serving the purposes of corporate planning or as a policy tool to be
used in combination with simulations of decision making]{.underline}.
Yet scenario analysis is not inherently limited to these uses. This
section provides a brief overview of the practice of scenario analysis
and the motivations underpinning its uses. It then makes a case for the
utility of the technique for political science scholarship and describes
how the scenarios deployed at NEFPC were created. The Art of Scenario
Analysis We characterize scenario analysis as the art of juxtaposing
current trends in unexpected combinations in order to articulate
surprising and yet plausible futures, often referred to as "alternative
worlds." [Scenarios]{.underline} are thus explicitly not forecasts or
projections based on linear extrapolations of contemporary patterns, and
they are not hypothesis-based expert predictions. Nor should they be
equated with simulations, which are best characterized as functional
representations of real institutions or decision-making processes (Asal
2005). Instead, they a[re depictions of possible future states of the
world, offered together with a narrative of the driving causal forces
and potential exogenous shocks that could lead to those
futures]{.underline}. Good scenarios [thus rely on explicit causal
propositions that, independent of one another, are plausible---yet, when
combined, suggest surprising and sometimes controversial future
worlds]{.underline}. For example, few predicted the dramatic fall in oil
prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving forces, such as
the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's slowing economic
growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern oil producers
such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends that---combined with
OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as prices began to
decline---came together in an unexpected way. While scenario analysis
played a role in war gaming and strategic planning during the Cold War,
the real antecedents of the contemporary practice are found in corporate
futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s (Raskin et al. 2005).
Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at Royal Dutch Shell in
1965, with the realization that the usual forecasting techniques and
models were not capturing the rapidly changing environment in which the
company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz 1991). In particular, it had
become evident that [straight-line extrapolations of]{.underline} past
[global trends were inadequate for anticipating the
evolving]{.underline} business [environment]{.underline}. Shell-style
scenario planning "helped break the habit, ingrained in most corporate
planning, of assuming that the future will look much like the present"
(Wilkinson and Kupers 2013, 4). Using scenario thinking, Shell
anticipated the possibility of two Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s
and hence was able to position itself for major disruptions in the
global petroleum sector. Building on its corporate roots, scenario
analysis has become a standard policymaking tool. For example, the
Project on Forward Engagement advocates linking systematic foresight,
which it defines as the disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to
planning and feedback loops to better equip the United States to meet
contemporary governance challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent
application of scenario thinking is found in the National Intelligence
Council's series of Global Trends reports, issued every four years to
aid policymakers in anticipating and planning for future challenges.
These reports present a handful of "alternative worlds" approximately
twenty years into the future, carefully constructed on the basis of
emerging global trends, risks, and opportunities, and intended to
stimulate thinking about geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with
corporate [scenario analysis]{.underline}, the [technique can be used in
foreign policymaking for long-range general planning purposes as well as
for anticipating and coping with more narrow and immediate
challenges]{.underline}. An example of the latter is the German Marshall
Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses four scenarios to map the
potential consequences of the Euro-area financial crisis (German
Marshall Fund 2013). Several features make scenario analysis
particularly useful for policymaking.5 Long-term global trends across a
number of different realms---social, technological, environmental,
economic, and political---combine in often-unexpected ways to produce
unforeseen challenges. Yet [the ability of decision makers to
imagine]{.underline}, let alone prepare for, [discontinuities in the
policy realm is constrained]{.underline} by their existing mental models
and maps. This limitation is exacerbated by well-known [cognitive bias
tendencies]{.underline} such as groupthink and confirmation bias (Jervis
1976; Janis 1982; Tetlock 2005). The power of
**[scenarios]{.underline}** lies in their ability to **[help individuals
break out of conventional modes of thinking and analysis by introducing
unusual combinations of trends and deliberate discontinuities in
narratives about the future]{.underline}**. [Imagining alternative
future worlds through a structured analytical process enables
policymakers to envision and thereby adapt to something altogether
different from the known present.]{.underline} The characteristics of
scenario analysis that commend its use to policymakers also make it well
suited to helping political scientists generate and develop
policy-relevant research programs. **[Scenarios are essentially
textured, plausible, and relevant stories that help us imagine how the
future political-economic world could be different from the past in a
manner that highlights policy challenges and
opportunities]{.underline}**. For example, terrorist organizations are a
known threat that have captured the attention of the policy community,
yet our responses to them tend to be linear and reactive. Scenarios that
explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of change---the rise of a new
peer competitor in the East that diverts strategic attention, volatile
commodity prices that empower and disempower various state and nonstate
actors in surprising ways, and the destabilizing effects of climate
change or infectious disease pandemics---can be useful for illuminating
the nature and limits of the terrorist threat in ways that may be missed
by a narrower focus on recognized states and groups. By illuminating the
potential strategic significance of specific and yet poorly understood
opportunities and threats, [scenario analysis helps to identify crucial
gaps in our collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends
and dynamics]{.underline}. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in
social science scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to
reality itself. Very simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp
relief often-overlooked yet pressing questions in international affairs
that demand focused investigation. [Scenarios]{.underline} thus
[offer]{.underline}, in principle, [an innovative tool for developing a
political science research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, achieving
this objective requires careful tailoring of the approach. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the [scenario
discussions]{.underline} themselves, as described below, [lay bare these
especially implausible claims and systematic biases]{.underline}.8 An
[explicit methodological approach underlies the written scenarios
themselves as well as the analytical process around
them]{.underline}---that of case-centered, structured, focused
comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal mechanisms
(George and Bennett 2005). [The]{.underline} use of
[scenario]{.underline}s is similar to counterfactual analysis in that it
[modifies certain variables in a given situation in order to analyze the
resulting effects]{.underline} (Fearon 1991). Whereas counterfactuals
are traditionally retrospective in nature and explore events that did
not actually occur in the context of known history, our [scenarios are
deliberately forward-looking and are designed to explore potential
futures that could unfold]{.underline}. As such, counterfactual analysis
is especially well suited to identifying how individual events might
expand or shift the "funnel of choices" available to political actors
and thus lead to different historical outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while
[forward-looking scenario analysis can better illuminate surprising
intersections and sociopolitical dynamics without the perceptual
constraints imposed by fine-grained historical knowledge]{.underline}.
We see scenarios as a complementary resource for exploring these
dynamics in international affairs, rather than as a replacement for
counterfactual analysis, historical case studies, or other
methodological tools. In the scenario process developed for NEFPC, three
distinct scenarios are employed, acting as cases for analytical
comparison. Each scenario, as detailed below, includes a set of explicit
"driving forces" which represent hypotheses about causal mechanisms
worth investigating in evolving international affairs. The [scenario
analysis]{.underline} process itself [employs templates]{.underline}
(discussed further below) [to serve as a graphical representation of a
structured, focused investigation and thereby as the research tool for
conducting case-centered comparative analysis]{.underline} (George and
Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this [structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas]{.underline}.
The scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented graduate students who are
otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which political
science dissertation ideas are typically developed. The initial
articulation of a dissertation project is generally an idiosyncratic and
personal undertaking (Useem 1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might
choose topics based on their coursework, their own previous policy
exposure, or the topics studied by their advisors. Research agendas are
thus typically developed by looking for "puzzles" in existing research
programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral students also, understandably, often
choose topics that are particularly amenable to garnering research
funding. Conventional grant programs typically base their funding
priorities on extrapolations from what has been important in the recent
past---leading to, for example, the prevalence of Japan and Soviet
studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism studies in the 2000s---in the
absence of any alternative method for identifying questions of likely
future significance. The scenario approach to generating research ideas
is grounded in the belief that these traditional approaches can be
complemented by identifying questions likely to be of great empirical
importance in the real world, even if these do not appear as puzzles in
existing research programs or as clear extrapolations from past events.
The [scenarios analyzed]{.underline} at NEFPC envision alternative
worlds that could develop in the medium (five to seven year) term and
[are designed to tease out issues scholars and policymakers may
encounter in the relatively near future so that they can begin thinking
critically about them now]{.underline}. [This timeframe offers a period
distant enough from the present as to avoid falling into current events
analysis, but not so far into the future as to seem like science
fiction]{.underline}. In imagining the worlds in which these scenarios
might come to pass, [participants learn strategies for avoiding failures
of creativity and for overturning the assumptions that prevent scholars
and analysts from anticipating and understanding the pivotal junctures
that arise in international affairs.]{.underline}

While nostalgia locates the ultimate enjoyment in the subject's own
past, paranoia locates it in the other. Paranoia thus offers the subject
not just the image of the ultimate enjoyment (like nostalgia) but also
an explanation for its absence. Nostalgia and paranoia usually operate
side by side in order to provide the subject a way of figuring its
missing enjoyment. On its own, nostalgia as a mode of subjectivity seems
to have limited political consequences. Groups may use nostalgia as a
political weapon, but its political weight is diffused to some extent
because it involves the subject\'s relation to itself rather than to an
other. The same cannot be said for paranoia, which is why finding a way
to counter paranoia represents an urgent political task. **[Paranoia is
political]{.underline}** in its very structure. [**It views the other as
a threat and produces hostility**]{.underline} toward the other. The
paranoid subject usually adopts one of two possible attitudes toward the
other. According to the first, paranoia serves to explain the loss of
the privileged object. If I take up a paranoid attitude toward the
other, I see her/ his enjoyment coming at the expense of mine. The other
enjoys the lost object that is rightfully mine. The other, having stolen
my enjoyment, bears responsibility for my existence as a subject of
loss. This type of paranoia removes the burden of loss from the subject
and places it onto the other, and in addition it functions, like
nostalgia, to convince the subject that having the object is a
possibility. According to the second attitude, however, paranoia
represents an attempt to convince ourselves that we have not lost the
privileged object. We are paranoid not that the other has stolen the
privileged object but that it plans to do so. The imagined threat that
the other poses reassures us that we have the ultimate enjoyment and
that this is what the other targets. By imagining a threat, we fantasize
the privileged object back into existence despite its status as
constitutively lost. At first glance, it is difficult to see how
paranoia might function as an attractive attitude for subjects to take
up. The paranoid subject must endure a constant menace that has no
tangible or definitive presence**. [Everyone that this subject meets is
a potential enemy in disguise threatening to steal or already having
stolen the subject\'s privileged object.]{.underline}** In terms of the
subject\'s own identity, paranoia does not provide security or
stability. In fact, it uproots all sense of security that the subject
has concerning its identity. But its appeal does not lie in how it
transforms subjectivity; its appeal stems from its ability to close the
gap in the social field of meaning, its ability to be a guarantor that
authorizes our social interaction. Paranoia develops in response to the
inherent inconsistency of social authority. There are authorities but no
Authority, and a decisive Authority would be necessary to provide
subjects a sense of foundation, a sense that there is solid ground
underneath their feet. Social proclamations and regulations place the
subject in an impossible position: one simply cannot believe and obey
every edict emanating from social authorities without being torn apart
in the effort. These contradictions occur on all levels of social
pronouncements. One hears, for instance, about the dangers of eating too
much fat, and then one hears about the cancer-preventing power of
chocolate. Parents tell their children not to fight and at the same time
tell them to stand up for themselves. George W. Bush claimed that the
Iraq War was waged to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction
and later claimed that its purpose was to liberate the country from a
cruel dictator. Such inconsistencies are not merely contingent
developments within our particular society but necessarily follow from
the ultimate groundlessness of the social order itself. There is no
final authority that calls all the shots in society and guarantees the
consistency of the social order. It is instead a structure in charge,
and this structure functions through its very misfiring. The
inconsistency of social authority- the gap in the social field of
meaning - provides it with an openness to difference. If social
authority was a closed circuit that operated without a hitch, it would
have no way of incorporating the subject into its fold. The subject
invests itself in social authority precisely because this authority
gives the subject contradictory demands. Faced with these incongruous
imperatives, the subject cannot readily decipher what the social
authority wants from it. Beneath the inconsistency, the desire of the
authority remains a mystery**. [The subject begins to desire in response
to this unknown desire of the social Other: the inconsistency of the
social authority]{.underline}** has the effect of attracting the subject
and constituting the desire of the subject as the desire of the Other. A
thoroughly consistent social authority, while logically unthinkable,
would not draw the desire of the subject in this way. It might force
individuals into obedience, but it would not create the investment in
the social order that the inconsistent social authority creates.
Confronting the inconsistency of social authority is not an easy task
for the subject. Many try to sustain a belief in its consistency through
an imaginary construction that represses contradictory ideas. The
problem with this solution is that these ideas become more powerful
through their repression, and the result is some form of neurosis.
Another possibility is the paranoid reaction. Rather than trying to
wrestle with the problem of the gap in authority, the paranoid subject
eliminates it by positing an other existing in this gap, an other behind
the scenes pulling the strings. As Slavoj **[Zizek
explains]{.underline}** it, \"**[Paranoia is]{.underline}** at its most
elementary a belief **[into an \'Other of the Other]{.underline}**; into
an Other who, hidden behind the Other of the explicit social texture,
programs what appears to us as the unforeseen effects of social life and
thus guarantees its consistency: beneath the chaos of market, the
degradation of morals, and so on, there is the purposeful strategy of
the Jewish plot.\" The comfort that paranoia provides for the subject
derives solely from this guarantee. For the paranoid subject, the
surface inconsistency of social authority hides an underlying
consistency authorized by a real authority whom most subjects never
notice. Paranoia simultaneously allows the subject to sense its own
superiority in recognizing the conspiracy and to avoid confronting the
horror of an inconsistent social authority. As with nostalgia, paranoia
is primarily aligned with a right-wing political agenda. Its
**[suspicion]{.underline}** of the other **[nourishes a nationalistic
politic]{.underline}**s and energizes the call for a return to
traditional social arrangements. Just as much of the investment in the
Cold War struggle derived from paranoia, **[it fuels the contemporary
war on terror.]{.underline}** The exemplary right-wing political
formation, **[Fascism, has its basis in paranoia]{.underline},** seeing
the Jew or some equivalent as secretly controlling the social order to
the detriment of all law-abiding citizens. The idea of an other
operating behind the scenes serves to justify restrictions on civil
liberties, racism, police violence, and so on. **[A paranoid populace is
a populace ready to embrace a Fascist regime]{.underline}.** Despite the
inherent link between paranoia and conservatism, leftists employ
paranoia to a vast extent, far more than they do nostalgia. Paranoid
theories about the secret brokers of power who decide the fate of the
capitalist world are widespread on the Left. It is common sense among
leftists that big oil companies have suppressed the development of
alternative energies, that the CIA assassinated Kennedy, and that major
drug companies control the Food and Drug Administration, just to name a
few of the more well known conspiracy theories. The truth or falsity of
these theories has nothing to do with their function for the subject who
accepts them. The paranoid subject is often correct in its various
speculations, but paranoia nonetheless provides a way for the subject to
avoid confronting the inconsistency of social authority. For the
paranoid subject, conspiracy theories don\'t simply explain a single
event; they solve the problem of the social order as such. According to
this thought process, all loss stems from the conspiracy, which has
derailed the social order and upset its balance. The paranoid subject
cannot accept the necessity of loss, and the conspiracy theory works to
render loss empirical rather than ontological. This is evident in Oliver
Stone\'s JFK (1991), a film in which Stone posits a vast conspiracy that
resulted in the death of Kennedy. Of course, Stone is probably correct
that this conspiracy existed, but the film goes astray primarily through
its apotheosis of Kennedy, an apotheosis that reveals what\'s at stake
in all paranoia. According to the film, had he remained in power,
Kennedy would have prevented the horror of the Vietnam War and thus
spared the United States the psychic wound that this war created. With
Kennedy, one can imagine an American social order existing without
strife and loss. The conspiracy theory allows Stone this image, which
testifies to the avoidability of loss.\" But Stone is not the only
leftist to turn to paranoia. Many do so in order to confront forces that
they otherwise couldn\'t identify. Among those who suffer from political
oppression, paranoia and conspiracy theory serve as vehicles for
thinking through systems of control and even mobilizing action against
those systems. As Peter Knight points out, \"Conspiracy thinking has
played an important role in constituting various forms of African
American political and cultural activism.\"38 When it directly produces
activism, the political valence of paranoia seems to tilt more clearly
to the left than it does in the case of Stone\'s film. In Marxist
Fredric Jameson focuses on a related aspect of paranoia as he analyzes
the paranoid film in The Geopolitical Aesthetic. In this work, Jameson
aligns conspiracy theory with what he calls cognitive mapping- the
attempt to think the global capitalist system in its totality. The
diffuseness of global capitalism prevents the kind of cognitive mapping
that was possible in earlier epochs. Today, in order to think the
totality at all, subjects must resort to the idea of a conspiracy. As
Jameson points out in his analysis of All the President's Men, \"The map
of conspiracy itself .. . suggests the possibility of cognitive mapping
as a whole and stands as its substitute and yet its allegory all at
once.\"40 Jameson\'s statement reflects his ambivalence about conspiracy
theory and paranoia - even though it allegorizes cognitive mapping, it
also substitutes for it - but he nonetheless sees its usefulness as a
strategy for the Left, especially when facing the global capitalist
leviathan. The problem is that even when it works to mobilize subjects
to fight against an oppressive system, **[paranoia has the effect of
depriving subjects of their agency]{.underline}**. By eliminating the
gap in social authority and filling in this gap with a real authority
who effectively runs the show, paranoia deprives subjects of the space
in which they exist as subjects. The subject occupies the position of
the gap in social authority; it emerges through and because of internal
inconsistency in the social field of meaning. The extent to which
paranoia allows the subject to experience social authority as a
consistent field is the extent to which it works against the subject
itself. Even if it manages tangible political victories, emancipatory
politics that relies on paranoia undermines itself by increasing the
power of authority in the thinking of subjects and decreasing their
freedom. What\'s more, it doesn\'t actually work. Like nostalgia,
[**paranoia can never constitute a successful strategy**]{.underline}
for the subject dealing with its fundamental condition. It will never
provide the enjoyment that it promises the subject. Uncovering and
eliminating the hidden real authority will bring not the ultimate
enjoyment but horrible disappointment. This is why the paranoid mindset
cannot admit to itself that the hidden other has been vanquished. [**The
enjoyment that paranoia does provide requires the continuing existence
of the threat, even though it imagines**]{.underline} an
**[enjoyment]{.underline}** that would come [**with the threat\'s
disappearance**.]{.underline} Paranoia runs aground due to its failure
to admit the connection between enjoyment and loss. It allows the
subject to imagine that loss is the contingent result of a secret
malevolent force that we might conquer. By implicitly positing the
avoidability of loss, paranoia leaves subjects unable to locate and
recognize the nature of their own enjoyment.
