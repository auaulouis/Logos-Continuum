DL 6-26-2019

By its plain language, Rule 35 grants a district court the authority
within a limited period of time to reduce or modify a defendant\'s
sentence after relinquishing jurisdiction. To
\"**[reduce]{.underline}**\" **[means to diminish in size, amount,
extent or number]{.underline}**, or to make smaller, lessen or shrink.
WEBSTER\'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1905 (1993). **[To
\"modify\" means to make more temperate and less extreme, or to lessen
the severity]{.underline}** of something. Id. at 1452. Thus, under the
plain meaning of its language, Rule 35 authorizes a district court to
diminish, lessen the severity of, or make more temperate a defendant\'s
sentence. An order placing a defendant on probation lessens the severity
of a defendant\'s sentence and thus falls within the district court\'s
authority granted by Rule 35. Other state jurisdictions have held
likewise in interpreting similar rules for reduction of sentence. See
State v. Knapp, 739 P.2d 1229, 1231-32 (Wy.1987) (similar rule of
criminal procedure authorizes reduction of a sentence of incarceration
to probation); People v. Santana, 961 P.2d 498, 499 (Co.Ct.App.1997)
(grant of probation is a \"reduction\" under Colorado Cr. R. 35(b)).

The state argues for construing Idaho\'s Rule 35 in accordance with the
cases interpreting former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, which
was similar in language.\[1\] See State v. Chapman, 121 Idaho 351, 352,
825 P.2d 74, 75 (1992).\[2\] However, we conclude that the
interpretation of Federal Rule 35 is not controlling in the instant case
because the language of Idaho\'s Rule 35 is distinguishable. **[The
former]{.underline}** Federal **[Rule]{.underline}** 35 **[did not
use]{.underline}** the term \"**[modify\" in describing a
reduction]{.underline}** of sentence as is currently provided in Idaho
Rule 35.

#### Violation---they only make it harder for the executive/companies/the military/etc. to enter into arms contracts. That's a modification not a reduction.

#### Effects topicality -- independent voting issue, destroys predictability as there is no limit to actions the USfg might take that might lead to a smaller amount of arms sales but not mandate it.

#### Extra topicality -- independent voting issue, their interp gives aff advantages to changing which branch of government has authority to determine the amount of US arms sales, ours limits the aff to advantages to the USfg reducing arms sales---only those have resolutional basis

#### Ground -- the neg loses topic disad links to reasons arms sales provide global stability. Restricting arms sales should also be neg counterplan ground.

In the case of a mutual life insurance company, the deduction for
policyholder dividends for any taxable year shall be reduced by the
amount determined under section 809.

\" \[T\]he amount determined\" under § 809, by which the policyholder
dividend deduction is to be \"reduced,\" is the \"excess\" specified in
§ 809(c) (1). **[Like the word \"excess,\" the word \"reduced\" is a
common, unambiguous, non-technical term that is given its ordinary
meaning]{.underline}**. See San Joaquin Fruit & Inv. Co., 297 U.S. at
499, 56 S. Ct. 569. \"**[Reduce\" means \"to diminish in size, amount,
extent, or number.\"]{.underline}** Webster\'s Third International
Dictionary 1905. **[Under CUNA\'s interpretation]{.underline}** of
\"excess\" in § 809(c), however, the result of the \"**[amount determin
\[ation\]\"]{.underline}** under § 809 **[would be not to reduce the
policyholder dividends deduction, but to increase it. This would
directly contradict the explicit instruction]{.underline}** in § 808(c)
(2) **[that the deduction \"be reduced.\" The word \"reduce\" cannot be
interpreted, as CUNA would treat it, to mean
\"increase.\"]{.underline}**

The fact that § 808(c) (2) permits only the reduction of the
policyholder dividend deduction reinforces the conclusion that § 809(c)
(1) does not cover a \"negative excess.\" Since Congress authorized only
a \"reduction,\" it is unlikely that it intended to permit a \"negative
excess,\" the effect of which would be not to reduce, but to increase
the deduction.

DL 6-26-2019

Under his retirement contract deceased agreed that in return for a plan
that would insure payment of the remainder of his initial fund to his
beneficiary after his death he would accept a lower rate of lifetime
compensation. Implicit in this agreement were various statutory
provisions governing the rights of both parties. One of these provisions
was section 83 which provided that if deceased were able to return to a
gainful occupation or actually did so his pension would accordingly be
reduced. This reduction would be governed by the amount he actually
earned or was capable of earning. We now reach one of the major issues
in the case, to wit: Is section 83 to be considered as a binding factor
in his contract and if **[so does \"reduce\" mean \"forfeit\" or
\"temporarily suspended]{.underline}**\"?

It seems obvious that section 83 was in the law to protect the System
against disability retirees who might, in truth, be capable of providing
for themselves without being on dole (albeit a \"contractural\" dole).
See Matter of Stewart v. O\'Dwyer (271 App. Div. 485, 490 \[1st Dept.,
1946\]), where such a purpose is ascribed to section 83\'s counterpart
in the New York City retirement statute. Deceased quit his work here
because of his physical defect and elected the plan of retirement he
fancied most suitable. He impliedly agreed to all the terms of the
contract which included section 83. When he became employed in
California at a considerable salary section 83 came into play and cut
off his monthly pension payments although his annuity payments were not
affected (thus he was not being deprived of anything he had
contributed). There is no persuasive 56\*56 argument that this was not
proper. When the California employment ceased, assuming deceased to be
still living, should he then be entitled to the withheld payments?

Section 83\'s counterpart with regard to nondisability pensioners,
section 84, prescribes a reduction only if the pensioner should again
take a public job. The disability pensioner is penalized if he takes any
type of employment. The reason for the difference, of course, is that in
one case the only reason pension benefits are available is because the
pensioner is considered incapable of gainful employment, while in the
other he has fully completed his \"tour\" and is considered as having
earned his reward with almost no strings attached. It would be
manifestly unfair to the ordinary retiree to accord the disability
retiree the benefits of the System to which they both belong when the
latter is otherwise capable of earning a living and had not fulfilled
his service obligation. If it were to be held that withholdings under
section 83 were payable whenever the pensioner died or stopped his other
employment the whole purpose of the provision would be defeated, i.e.,
the System might just as well have continued payments during the other
employment since it must later pay it anyway. The section says
\"**[reduced\", does not say]{.underline}** that monthly payments shall
be **[temporarily suspended]{.underline}**; it says that the pension
itself shall be reduced. **[The plain dictionary meaning of the word is
to diminish, lower or degrade. The word \"reduce]{.underline}**\" seems
adequately to **[indicate permanency]{.underline}**.

Aside from the practical aspect indicating permanency other indicia
point to the same conclusion.

From 1924 (L. 1924, ch. 619) to 1947 (L. 1947, ch. 841) a provision
appeared in the Civil Service Law which read substantially as follows:
\"If the pension of a beneficiary is reduced for any reason, the amount
of such reduction shall be transferred from the pension reserve fund to
the pension accumulation fund during that period that such reduction is
in effect.\" (See L. 1924, ch. 619, § 2 \[Civil Service Law, § 58, subd.
4\]; L. 1947, ch. 841 \[Civil Service Law, § 66, subd. e\].) This
provision reappears in the 1955 Retirement and Social Security Law as
subdivision f of section 24. This provision is useful for interpretative
purposes. Since it prescribes that moneys not paid because of reduction
should be transferred back to the accumulation fund the conclusion is
inescapable that such **[reductions were meant to be
permanent.]{.underline}** If temporary suspensions were intended this
bookkeeping device would result in a false picture of the funds, i.e.,
the reserve fund would be depleted when it would contain adequate funds
to meet eventual payments 57\*57 to present pensioners. Likewise, the
accumulation fund would be improperly inflated with respect to the
present pensioners.

Section 64 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (§ 85 under the
1947 act) provides that any disability pension must be reduced by the
amount payable pursuant to the Workmen\'s Compensation Law if
applicable. In Matter of Dalton v. City of Yonkers (262 App. Div. 321,
323 \[1941\]) this court interpreted \"reduce\" to mean \"offset\" in
holding that under then section 67 (relating to Workmen\'s Compensation
benefits as do its successors sections 85 and 64), pensions were to be
offset by compensation benefits. This is merely another indication that
\"**[reduce\" means]{.underline}** a **[diminishing]{.underline}** of
the pension pursuant to a given formula **[rather than a mere
recoverable, temporary suspension]{.underline}** during the time other
benefits or salaries are being received by the pensioner. (Also, cf.,
Retirement and Social Security Law, § 101 \[§ 84 under the 1947 act\].)

In March 1953 Bloom received **[a reduction in force]{.underline}**
(R.I.F.) **[notice]{.underline}** from the National Production
Authority, and his last day of work in that branch was May 22. In view
of the R.I.F., Bloom asked for his old job in the Bureau of the Census,
and resumed it immediately after May 22. On May 29, 1953 **[the
appellant was given]{.underline}** a R.I.F. notice **[by the Bureau of
the Census, stating that his last day of work would be June
30.]{.underline}** By subsequent letters, the appellant\'s separation
was postponed to August 28. On August 30 Bloom was promoted from his
GS-11 position to the GS-12 position which the appellant had been
holding in an acting capacity for more than a year. **[The appellant
claims that there was no genuine reduction in force since Bloom was
brought in to replace him, leaving the same number of employees after as
before the purported reduction.]{.underline}** The fact of Bloom\'s
former employment in the Bureau of the Census is immaterial, since the
parties agree that Bloom had no reemployment rights. Executive Order No.
10180, U.S.Code Cong. Service 1950, p. 1671, issued November 13, 1950,
15 F.R. 7745, granted authority to the Civil Service Commission to
prescribe regulations governing the rights to reemployment of employees
transferring from one agency of the Government to another. The Civil
Service Commission, by Transmittal Sheet 316, of November 13, 1950, by
Departmental Circular No. 643 and a press release, both issued on
November 30, 1950, by Departmental Circular No. 653 issued on February
23, 1951, prescribed the procedure by which an employee might obtain
reemployment rights. The prescribed procedure was not followed in
Bloom\'s case.1 The defendants rely upon Civil Service Regulations,
section 8.108, 17 F.R. 343, which in fact was cited by the Bureau of the
Census in its personnel files as the legal basis for Bloom\'s
reemployment. The section says: \"The Commission hereby delegates
authority to agencies: \"(1) To promote, demote, or reassign any
permanent employee having a competitive status and serving in a
competitive position.\" The defendants say that Bloom\'s reemployment
was merely a \"reassignment\" within the same \"agency\", the Department
of Commerce. The plaintiff disputes this, and cites 13 U.S.C. 1, which
denominates the Bureau of the Census as an agency within, and under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce. He cites 5 U.S.C.A. § 1001,
defining the term agency for the purposes of the Administrative
Procedure Act, giving it a definition which would apply to the Bureau of
the Census. He cites the United States Government Organization Manual,
1951-52, which lists in Appendix C at page 656ff the departments and
agencies which have submitted separate statements of organizations
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, and listing the Bureau of
the Census and the National Production Authority as two such agencies.
His most persuasive citation is that of Commerce Department Order No.
130, which rescinded Order No. 123 and provided that the Civil Service
regulations relating to the transfer of employees between agencies
should thereafter apply to the transfer of employees of the Department
to the National Production Authority. We think that the Department of
Commerce itself regarded the Bureau of the Census and the National
Production Authority as separate agencies, for the purpose of the
application of Civil Service regulations. The defendants, however, argue
that one\'s retention status for the purpose of a reduction in force is
not, in any event, an agency status, but a Government-wide status. They
point to section 20.2(h) of the Regulations of the Civil Service
Commission, 17 F.R. p. 11733 which says: \"\`Retention credits\' are
credits given for length of government service and performance
ratings.\" It may well be that if a vacancy occurs in an agency, and an
employee with long Government service in an entirely different branch of
the Government is hired to fill it, and there later develops the
necessity for a reduction in force, the long period of Government
service will give that employee a higher retention status than those who
have been in the particular agency longer than he has been. But **[if an
agency, a week before reduction in force notices are to be sent out, can
hire such an employee from a different agency, and retain him and
discharge another employee who has been longer with the particular
agency, there is no real protection for faithful employees of the
agency.]{.underline}** While it would be hard to spell out in
regulations any time limits within which such hiring could not be done,
and we are cited to no regulation which attempts to cover such a
situation, the instant case presents no real difficulty. The excess of
employees making the reduction in force necessary was created by the
hiring of Bloom shortly after May 22. On May 29 the plaintiff, whom
Bloom was to replace, was given his reduction in force notice. The
creation of the surplus of employees and the reduction in force
eliminating that surplus were steps in the same transaction, both steps
being in contemplation when the first step was taken. In general,
Government agency actions adversely affecting Government employees,
whether they be demotions or separations, are occasioned for one of two
reasons and there are statutes and regulations governing the
circumstances under which such adverse actions may be taken and the
manner in which they must be carried out. Separations for cause, that
is, separations which are necessitated because of the poor performance
or undesirable behavior of the employees are covered by the Lloyd-La
Follette Act, 5 U.S.C.A. § 652, and by section 14 of the Veterans
Preference Act, 5 U.S.C.A. § 863. Separations or demotions which are
required to meet some administrative exigency within an employing agency
are known as reductions-in-force and the applicable authority for such
action is found in section 12 of the Veterans Preference Act, 5 U.S.C.A.
§ 861 and in the Civil Service regulations issued thereunder. From
February 2, 1948 to June 29, 1949 section 20.2(a) of the regulations of
the Civil Service Commission contained the following definition of a
reduction in force: \"\`**[Reduction in force\' means]{.underline}** the
involuntary separation from the rolls of a department, or furlough in
excess of thirty days, of one or more employees in order to reduce
personnel. **[Reduction in personnel may have to be made because of lack
of funds, personnel ceilings, reorganization]{.underline}**, decrease of
work, to make a position available for a former employee with
established reemployment or restoration rights, or for other reasons. \*
\* \*\" \[Italics supplied.\] The italicized clause in the above quoted
regulation sets forth the circumstances which, in general, justify an
agency in initiating a reduction in force. On June 29, 1948 the Civil
Service Commission made a minor change in this regulation. On January
30, 1953 the Civil Service Commission issued an extensive revision to
Part 20 of its regulations relating to reduction in force in general.
For some reason not explained in Transmittal Sheet 414 of the United
States Civil Service Commission Federal Personnel Manual, the definition
of reduction in force omitted the second clause of the former
regulation, the one italicized in the above quotation. The transmittal
sheet stated that the revisions in the regulation were intended to
simplify and clarify reduction in force regulations. The primary concern
of the Commission appears to have been to reduce the 23 possible
subgroups of competing employees which had been set up in the former
regulation to 6 subgroups. This revised regulation was the one in effect
when the plaintiff was separated from his position. On May 14, 1957 the
Commission again revised Part 20 of its regulations relating to
reduction in force. At that time the primary concern of the Commission
was to reflect in its regulations the holding of the United States Court
of Claims in Parks v. United States, 147 F. Supp. 261, 137 C.Cls. 297,
which held that a demotion occurring in connection with a reorganization
in an employing agency amounted to a reduction in force and that
preference eligible employees demoted in the course of such
reorganization were entitled to the benefits of the provisions of
section 12 of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 and the Civil Service
regulations governing reduction in force. Transmittal sheet No. 567 of
the Federal Personnel Manual pointed out that as then written, the
reduction in force regulations were applicable only where there was a
reduction in the net strength of the employing activity. A demotion, of
course, does not necessarily affect such net strength of the agency and
the regulations were therefore revised to reflect the court\'s holding
in the Parks case. The substance of the italicized sentence from section
20.2(a) of the 1949 regulations was reinstated in the 1957 version of
the regulations which read as follows: \"\`Reduction in force\' is the
release of an employee from a competitive level by means of separation
from the rolls, furlough for more than thirty (30) days, reassignment
involving displacement, or change to lower grade; when such actions are
caused by lack of work, shortage of funds, reorganization, or exercise
of regulatory reassignment or reemployment rights. \* \* \*\" \[Italics
supplied.\] The transmittal sheet did not explain why the above-quoted
regulations was revised to once more define the circumstances under
which a reduction in force may be initiated. The transmittal sheet did
state, however, that there are many situations in which the use of the
reduction in force system is the most orderly and equitable means of
shifting or separating employees whose skills have become surplus to the
activity and that reduction in force applies to situations where adverse
actions must be taken as the result of planned management decisions to
change or eliminate previously assigned duties for reasons which are
impersonal to the employees who are adversely affected. A reading of the
reduction in force regulations as they have existed since the enactment
of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 makes it clear that this comment
on the part of the Civil Service Commission in 1957 did not represent
any change in policy with respect to the circumstances which would give
rise to a reduction in force in a particular Government agency. In the
circumstances of this case it would seem that the plaintiff\'s
separation was not a \"reduction in force\" because it was not required
by lack of work, shortage of funds, reorganization, exercise of
regulatory reassignment or exercise of reemployment rights. It was made
necessary by the employment of Bloom --- not the regulatory reassignment
or the reemployment of Bloom --- but the employment of Bloom in a
competitive level in which there was no vacancy. **[Our conclusion is
that the action of the defendants in discharging the appellant was in
violation of the law and the applicable regulations.]{.underline}**

For the second question, the provision demonstrates that the goal of
adoption of such laws and regulations must be to 'prevent, reduce, and
control' MPLA. In so doing, the 141 LOSC obliges States to 'taking into
account internationally agreed rules, standards, and recommended
practices and procedures'.480 Having considered the ordinary meanings of
the term 'prevent, reduce, and control', '**[prevent' means 'to stop
something from happening or someone from doing
something.]{.underline}**'481 **[The word 'reduce' means 'to make
something smaller in size, amount,]{.underline}** degree, importance
etc.'482 and the word 'control' means 'to order, limit, or rule
something or someone\'s actions or behaviour.' 483 From the meanings,
**[the term 'prevent' suggests an action to stop the future occurrence
of something, whereas the terms 'reduce']{.underline}** and 'control',
noting their difference**[, point to an action dealing with something
that has already happened and continues to occur, but needs to be made
smaller, limited or regulated]{.underline}**. Also, control also applies
to future pollution in the sense that it limits the future pollution to
be created or emitted not to exceed the specified level. Therefore, the
preliminary reading of these terms suggests that laws and regulations
adopted to deal with MPLA must yield the result that conforms with these
terms. In so doing, the adoption of laws and regulations to prevent,
reduce, and control MPLA can be done by legislating primary or secondary
regulations with the use of various legal techniques and procedures and
are underpinned by some rules and principles of international law
discussed in the previous chapter. These legal techniques and procedures
can be used to achieve the prevention, reduction and control of MPLA
depending on the design and use of them. Noting that the measures
outlined below are not exhaustive and not exclusively limited to
implement any specific obligation, these are typical legal techniques
and procedures used to prevent, reduce, and control pollution and
therefore protect the environment. They can be categorised into two
groups, that is, (1) substantive and (2) procedural legal techniques and
measures. They can be discussed hereunder.

Another **[approach to]{.underline}** distilling **[the meaning
of]{.underline}** **["substantially]{.underline}** similar" **[is to
attempt to convert the concept to percentage
measurements.]{.underline}** Contemplation of the meaning in

50 percent, but not too much more.]{.underline}** Though some could
argue that substantial should be viewed as merely large, even perhaps
the largest, but not necessarily more than 50 percent. On the other
hand, "**[substantially identical" would likely imply a high
correlation, say, more than 90 percent]{.underline}**. "Substantially
similar" is likely somewhere in between. "Substantially similar" implies
less than perfect similarity; if the FASB authors had intended perfect
similarity, they would most likely have used a term such as "completely
similar."

Thursday by the State Department. **[The department previously announced
that FY18 brought in \$55.66 billion in foreign military
sales]{.underline}**, an uptick of 33 percent over FY17's \$41.93
billion. Through the Foreign Military Sales process, the U.S. government
serves as a go-between for foreign partners and American industry.
**[What had not been released until now is the total direct commercial
sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy
systems from industry. Those figures topped \$136.6 billion for FY18, a
6.6 percent increase]{.underline}** from FY17's \$128.1 billion. The
Trump administration has made selling American defense goods abroad a
key plank of its governance plan, under the guiding principal that
"economic security is national security." Earlier this year, the
department rolled out its new Conventional Arms Transfer policy, or CAT,
as well as new guidance for selling unmanned systems, with the explicit
goal of increasing arms sales. However, tying this year's figures to the
CAT changes may be a stretch. Sales can fluctuate year by year because
of the size of certain weapons packages; a pair of large Saudi Arabian
purchases in 2012 famously set that year up for a massive \$287 billion
annual total. And there has already been steady growth each of the last
three years, even before the Trump administration's reforms kicked in,
with \$148.6 billion in total sales in FY16; \$170 billion in FY17; and
\$192.2 billion in FY18. A State Department official, speaking on
background ahead of the official release of these figures, acknowledged
to Defense News that these figures can't be tied directly to changes in
policy, noting they represent a "dynamic picture" and that the
department is aware there are some factors "we do not control." Still,
the official expressed confidence that as the CAT policy is enacted, it
will lead to a natural growth in sales. How much, however, is hard to
nail down. "I don't want to speculate on a particular goal that we're
looking at" for FY19, the official said. "We think a 13 percent increase
is a significant increase year over year. We'd like to maintain that
pace, but there are other factors that go into a given set of annual
numbers, so I'm hesitant to give a target goal." Thanks to both the CAT
changes and export reform efforts beginning under the Obama
administration, there are more options for countries to use direct
commercial sales, or DCS, for their procurements. Asked if that meant
DCS might grow as FMS cases drop, the official said that is "one
dynamic" under review, but noted that "as certain systems start going
through DCS, you'll have new systems backfilling the FMS queue." "Things
may transfer more on DCS direction, but new systems, new capabilities,
will be preferred to be kept in the FMS channel," the official added.

Change in selected pressures on natural ecosystems 2002-32. For the
ecosystem quality component, see the explanation of the Natural Capital
Index. Values for the cumulative pressures were derived as described
under Natural Capital Index. The maps show the relative increase or
decrease in pressure between 2002 and 2032. \'No change\' means less
than 10 per cent change in pressure over the scenario period; **[small
increase or decrease means between 10 and 50 per cent change;
substantial increase or decrease means 50 to 100 per cent
change]{.underline}**; strong increase means more than doubling of
pressure. Areas which switch between natural and domesticated land uses
are recorded separately.

#### In context, substantial means 50% of total arms exports.

but a moderate estimate would put it at over \$150 billion since 2007.
This includes hundreds of advanced fighter jets, attack and utility
helicopters; advanced munitions; Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC)
Ships; as well as Patriot and THAAD air defense systems. Many of these
arms sales frequently generate follow-on, multiyear paid training,
technical and logistical support as well as the building of relevant
infrastructure.

## Foreign Military Sales

### 1nc

#### Foreign Military Sales require Congressional notification of arms valued at \$14 million or more.

**[USNI News]{.underline}**. (20**[19]{.underline}**). Report to
Congress on Foreign Military Sales - USNI News. \[online\] Available at:
https://news.usni.org/2019/04/03/report-congress-foreign-military-sales-2
\[Accessed 27 Jun. 2019\].

This report reviews the process and procedures that currently apply to
congressional consideration of foreign arms sales proposed by the
President. This includes consideration of proposals to sell major
defense equipment, defense articles and services, or the retransfer to
third-party states of such military items. Under Section 36(b) of the
Arms Export Control Act (AECA), [[Congress must be]{.mark} formally
[notified]{.mark}]{.underline} 30 calendar days before the
Administration can take the final steps [[to conclude a]{.mark}
government-to-government [foreign military sale of major defense
equipment valued at \$14 million or more, defense articles or services
valued at \$50 million or more, or design and construction services
valued at \$200 million or more]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of
such sales to NATO member states, NATO, Japan, Australia, South Korea,
Israel, or New Zealand, Congress must be formally notified 15 calendar
days before the Administration can proceed with the sale. However, the
prior notice [[threshold values are higher for sales to NATO
members]{.mark}, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New
Zealand]{.underline}. Commercially licensed arms sales also must be
formally notified to Congress 30 calendar days before the export license
is issued if they involve the sale of major defense equipment valued at
\$14 million or more, or defense articles or services valued at \$50
million or more (Section 36(c) AECA). In the case of such sales to NATO
member states, NATO, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New
Zealand, Congress must be formally notified 15 calendar days before the
Administration is authorized to proceed with a given sale. As with
government-to-government sales, the prior notice threshold values are
higher for sales to NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel,
or New Zealand.

Furthermore, commercially licensed arms sales cases involving defense
articles that are firearms-controlled under category I of the United
States Munitions List and valued at \$1 million or more must also be
formally notified to Congress for review 30 days prior to the license
for export being approved. In the case of proposed licenses for such
sales to NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New
Zealand, 15 days prior notification is required.

In general, the executive branch, after complying with the terms of
applicable U.S. law, principally contained in the AECA, is free to
proceed with an arms sales proposal unless Congress passes legislation
prohibiting or modifying the proposed sale. Under current law Congress
faces two fundamental obstacles to block or modify a presidential sale
of military equipment: it must pass legislation expressing its will on
the sale, and it must be capable of overriding a presumptive
presidential veto of such legislation. Congress, however, is free to
pass legislation to block or modify an arms sale at any time up to the
point of delivery of the items involved. This report will be updated, if
notable changes in these review procedures or applicable law occur.

#### That excludes any country that doesn't receive at least 14 million. We'll insert a chart.

## Arms

### 1nc

#### Interpretation---topical affs must only reduce weapons, weapons systems, and support 

#### Foreign Military Sales include arms, equipment, services, and training

**Gouré 16** \[Daniel Gouré, Ph.D., Foreign Military Sales Remain An
Important Tool Of U.S. National Security, Lexington Institute,
2-26-2016, Accessible Online at
https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/foreign-military-sales-remain-an-important-tool-of-u-s-national-security/7-1-2019

One of the most important of these tools is **[foreign military
sales]{.underline}** (FMS). The complex role of FMS is reflected, in
part, in the fact that the program is run by the Department of State and
not the Department of Defense. One reason for this unusual management
approach is that the FMS program **[involves sales by the U.S.
government of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense services, and
military training to foreign governments.]{.underline}** As a result,
such sales reflect the views of the U.S. government with respect to the
recipient country, its relationships with others in the region and the
overall approach this country takes to mitigating the threat of regional
or global conflict.

#### Only weapons, weapons systems, and support meet all conditions to classify as "arms"

-for a transfer to be a transfer of "arms," it must:

-involve the defense industry

-would not be a transfer the target would seek if there were no military

-must be related to the lethality of the commodity

-must increase the capabilities of the target military

**Brzoska 82** \[Brzoska, Michael, Department of Political Science
Hamburg University. \"Arms transfer data sources.\" Journal of Conflict
Resolution 26.1 (1982): 77-108.\] 7-1-2019

DEFINITION OF ARMS TRANSFERS

**[What is an arms transfer? Let us look at the \"arms\" part
first.]{.underline}** What comes to mind here **[first as a
distinguishing criterion between arms and nonarms is the lethality of
the transferred commodity.]{.underline}** But this criterion does not
take us very far. **[A kitchen knife seems more lethal]{.underline}** at
first glance **[than an electronic communication
implement]{.underline}** does**[; but the second rather than the first
must be classified as a weapon when linked to a sophisticated weapon
system.]{.underline}** **[One approach]{.underline}** to this problem
**[would be to]{.underline}** use something like the category
\"potentially very lethal\" weapons and **[call only the major weapons
\"arms.\" Another approach would be]{.underline}** an
**[institutional]{.underline}** one: **[All transfers to the
military]{.underline}** forces would be seen as arms transfers. **[We
could combine th]{.underline}**e functional and the institutional
p**[erspectives and name \"arms\" anything that raises the potential
destructive power of the entity within a national boundary that is
concerned with the use of force, which could include the military,
militia, and]{.underline}**

\[figure in original\]

**[police. This excludes arms transfers to individuals in a country or
to subnational groups.]{.underline}** This definition actually boils
down to an institutional one as almost all transfers to the armed forces
do indeed raise the power potential of an armed force. It should also be
considered that there are other factors, e.g., the arms production
equipment transferred to a military industry.

**[For]{.underline}** the **[trade]{.underline}** statistician, these
very limited theoretical suggestions have to be translated into
categories of commodities in each case. In Table I, we present a list of
commodities that could be meaningfully included in a definition of arms
transfers. But **[it is not only commodities transferred that increases
the destructive potential; we also have to include services and know-how
that support the ultimate aim of destruction.]{.underline}** Finally,
some consideration should be given to the \"transfer.\" When is a
transfer accomplished? The potential power of a military is usually
increased when friendly foreign troops are stationed in the country or a
friendly navy establishes naval bases. So the nation-state approach is
not sufficient in all cases.

**[With regard to the problem clusters identified above, various parts
of the list in Table I can be usefully included in an arms transfer
definition. Cluster 1 (arms industry) can probably best be tackled with
an institutional approach.]{.underline}** A relevant question here is,
what external demand to the industry would vanish if the military sector
in all recipient countries were extinct? Would civilian demand fill the
gaps in terms of capacity utilization? Obviously, producers of hardware
weapons are more affected than industries that produce \"dual-purpose
equipment.\" In this respect arms transfers are very similar in scope to
\"procurement.\" **[Cluster 2 (recipient\'s burden) can be approached
with a similar question: What imports would be avoided if there were no
military?]{.underline}** But here, more items, especially follow-up
inputs into the military, are of interest. **[For analysis of cluster 3
(military use-value) problems, the extended lethality definition seems
the most appropriate.]{.underline}** Other authors have suggested
looking at the \"core\" weapon systems only as these constitute the
power of a military force. But this is only partially true-in
particular, training, services, and support equipment determine to a
large degree the \"use-value\" of weapon systems transferred. **[The
scope of cluster 4 (dependence) problems deviates most from the others:
Important here is the possibility of changing suppliers and the question
of the extent to which arms can be operative without foreign spares,
training, and so on.]{.underline}**

TIME PERSPECTIVE OF ARMS TRANSFERS

Although arms are transferred at distant points in time, arms transfers
as processes stretch over longer periods. Between the demonstration of
political cooperation (cluster 4) in the demand or offer for

![](media/image1.png){width="10.758333333333333in" height="6.025in"}

![](media/image2.png){width="10.458333333333334in" height="4.775in"}

contract talks to the final obsolescence of the transferred item, many
years will pass. In between lie talks about the transfer agreements on
various aspects of the transfer, the production of the equipment, the
transfer of the system, the payment for the weapon system, and the
delivery of services, training, or spare parts to keep the weapon system
in operation. We can conclude that which points in time, or rather
periods of time, are of interest depends on the question asked. Since
production has to occur before delivery, the time-lapse before delivery
is most important for exporting countries. Also important is the date of
payment.

The economic burden on the recipient\'s economy (cluster 2) has two
facets: the original payment for the weapon system, and the opportunity
costs for creating an environment for the weapon system and for keeping
it working, which divert resources (manpower, capital) from the civilian
to the military sector. The military \"use-value\" (cluster 3) starts
with the transfer of the first weapon system, but depending on deficits
in technical skills and so forth this may not be on a high level.
Rather, the \"use-value\" will generally increase as time goes by,
because of training, infrastructure creation, and assimilation of
military personnel to the weapon system. The political demonstration of
\"togetherness\" (cluster 4) between recipient and supplier may become
evident at the announcement of talks, the conclusion of a contract, or
the actual delivery. Usually, the dependence of a recipient on the
supplier only begins with delivery, the need for spare parts, munitions,
and so on. What is needed then, if all clusters are of interest, is a
time schedule of the arms transfer process, including training, support,
and infrastructure. For many questions it does not suffice to know the
actual dates of delivery.

#### Violation---they only reduce services/data/support/etc or include nonarms such as PMCs and basing

#### Ground -- the neg loses topic disad links to reasons arms sales improve the military of the target country since the aff reduces data/services/etc rather than munitions

#### Extra topicality -- independent voting issue---the aff garners extra offense off of PMCs, basing, etc., which are their own topic. Vote neg to prevent a flood of arguments from the college military presence topic 

## Sales

### Has to end a whole market

#### Interpretation---topical affs must either 1) end all sales to a target country, or 2) end all sales of a type of arm.

#### "Sales" is generic and refers to sales in general and not individual transactions. 

**Byrd** "Generic Meaning," Georgia State University, Transcript of
lecture given by Pat Byrd (Department of Applied Linguistics & ESL)

[Here are some things that we do know about these [generic noun
phrase]{.mark} types when they [are used]{.mark} in
context]{.underline}**: 1. The + singular: The computer has changed
modern life. ¶ This form is considered more formal than the others\--and
is not as likely to be used in conversation as the plural noun:
Computers have changed modern life. ¶ Master (1987) found in the sample
that he analyzed that this form with the was often used to introduce at
topic\--and came at the beginning of a paragraph and in introductions
and conclusions. 2. [Zero + plural:]{.underline}** [Computers are
machines. Computers have changed modern life. Probably the most common
form [for a generalization]{.mark}. It can be used in all
contexts\--including both conversation (Basketball players make too much
money) and academic writing (Organisms as diverse as humans and squid
share many biological processes).]{.underline} **¶ Perhaps used more in
the hard sciences and social sciences than in the humanities. ¶ 3. A +
singular: A computer is a machine. This generic structure is used to
refer to individual instances of a whole group and is used to classify
whatever is being discussed. The form is often used for definitions of
terms. ¶ It is also often used to explain occupations. My sister is a
newspaper reporter. I am a teacher. Use is limited to these
\"classifying\" contexts. Notice that this form can\'t always be
subtituted for the other: \*Life has been changed by a computer. \*A
computer has changed modern life. 4. Zero + noncount: Life has been
changed by the computer.** [The]{.underline} **most basic**
[meaning]{.underline} **and** [use of noncount nouns is
generic]{.underline}**\--they are fundamentally about a very abstract
level of meaning. Thus,** [the most common use]{.underline} **of
noncount nouns** [is]{.underline} **this use** [with no article for
generic meaning.]{.underline} **¶ Zero Article and Generic Meaning¶**
[Most [nouns without articles have generic meaning]{.mark}. Two types
are involved. 1. [Zero + plural: Computers are machines]{.mark}.
Computers have changed modern life. 2. Zero + noncount: Life has been
changed by the computer.]{.underline}

\'The term **[\'market\']{.underline}** as used by economists has a
different meaning from ordinary usage. It does not mean literally the
physical place in which commodities are sold or purchased (as in
\'village market\'), nor does it **[mean]{.underline}** the stages that
a commodity passes through between the producer and the consumer (as in
marketing channels). Rather it refers in an abstract way to the purchase
and sale transactions of a commodity and the formation of its price.
Used in this way, the term refers to the countless decisions made by
producers of **[a commodity]{.underline}** (the supply side of the
market) and consumers of a commodity (the demand side of the market),
which taken together determine the price level of the commodity \... the
term is detached from any particular geographical coverage. The
geographical scope of the term depends on the context in which it is
being used. It may **[refer to]{.underline}** the local situation in
some part of the rural economy, for example the market for cassava in
southern Tanzania, or it can refer to the **[country as a
whole]{.underline}**, the region, or the international economy. Thus the
expression \'world market\' refers to the process of price formation at
an international level for traded agricultural commodities.\' Source:
Ellis (1990) pp. 6-7. (2) The business perspective Business people tend
to use the term **[\'market\']{.underline}** to
**[describe]{.underline}** the groups of individuals or organizations
that make up the pool of actual and potential customers for their goods
and services. These groups fall into one or more of the following
categories: **[geographic]{.underline}**, demographic or socioeconomic,
psychographic, behavioural **[or sectoral]{.underline}**.

#### Violation---they only reduce one type of arm to one country

#### Limits --The US sells arms to 98 countries and there are 20 categories on the US munitions list (if we don't count subcategories or individual munitions). That means there are 1,960 affs for us to prep under their interpretation plus every unpredictable permutation of countries and categories. That's 98 factorial times 20 factorial. That's 2.29347e+172. There's only 10e+82 atoms in the universe. Under their interp we have to prep more case negs than there are atoms in the universe. Limits key to clash and sanity. 

#### Ground -- our interp requires affs to be big enough to ensure links to core topic disads.

**[Transaction]{.underline}** Sales **[v]{.underline}**. Relationship
**[Sales]{.underline}** Nov 16, 2014 John is a young professional who is
in his last semester of getting his MBA. He told me that he was
passionate about sales and that he wanted to do something where his
evaluation and compensation depended on his sales skills. I asked him
did he like Transactional Sales or Relationship Sales, as there was a
difference. He did not know the difference and asked me to explain. In
my view, **[transaction]{.underline}** sales **[is]{.underline}**
selling **[a single]{.underline}** transaction, product or
**[deal]{.underline}**. You are trying to provoke AN ACTION, at this
moment in time, getting a customer to buy your product, process, or
event. The important competitive parameters are your track record,
price, extra amenities, or something else that you can deliver around
that single transaction. Your ability and opportunity to compete is
based on your product offering rather than your relationship with the
customer. **[Examples of transaction]{.underline}** sales
**[are]{.underline}** found in selling **[cars, clothes, pharmaceutical
products, real estate, and even some financial services, especially
daily trades]{.underline}**, where the key competitive parameter is best
price, for the largest volume, or in other words, best execution.
Customer satisfaction in transaction sales is all about best execution
on that single transaction. If you have the best price, can perform in
the most efficient way, then you are competitive and have a high
probability of winning in transaction sales. If you want to be
successful in this space, you must be quick on your feet, very
articulate, able to find the competitive edge, using track record,
price, or a special offering and have the resources to deliver the
product or process. Relationship **[Sales is selling based on the length
and strength of a relationship]{.underline}**. A customer has to know
and trust you as a sales person in order for you to even get an
opportunity to compete for the business. Relationship **[selling has a
long]{.underline}** lead **[time, unlike transaction]{.underline}**
selling, where you can step up to compete as long as you have the
required credentials and ability to deliver. Your ability to be taken
seriously as a competitor for the business depends on how well the
customer knows you as you enter into the competition. An example of
relationship selling is selling asset management products to
institutional allocators. In many cases, you have to be invited into the
Request For Proposal (RFP), and will only be shortlisted, if the
customer has a high degree of confidence that you will be able to
deliver the desired services. The only way that they will acquire that
degree of confidence is if they have spent time outside of the RFP
process getting to know you, your company and the products that you have
to offer.

#### A transaction is only one instance of an exchange.

### Excludes future sales

#### Contextually, reduction includes limitations on growth.

On July 26, 1982, 12 days after their first meeting,
**[Lilley]{.underline}** called again on President Chiang. This time he
**[delivered a \"non-paper]{.underline}**\"\[6\] again
**[stating]{.underline}** that **[the \"U.S. side has no intention of

does not agree to the PRC\'s demand to have prior consultations with
them on arms sales to Taiwan.\" **[It went on to outline the U.S.
proposal to the PRC about arms sales reduction over time\--language
which in fact was included in the communiqué\--and twice made the point

will **[continue to advocate only to use peaceful means to settle the
Taiwan issue]{.underline}**.\"\[7\]

#### Reductions can be about future spending

**CRFB 18** \[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, nonpartisan

KL 7-1-2019

Strong, sustained economic growth is an important ingredient in putting
the debt on a sustainable course. In addition to increasing incomes and
raising standards of living, faster economic growth can increase federal
tax revenue and raise the nation\'s capacity for holding debt. For that
reason, **[any comprehensive agenda]{.underline}** to repair the
nation\'s ailing long-term fiscal outlook **[will likely require
reductions in future spending]{.underline}**, increases in future taxes,
and faster economic growth.

## **Substantial**

#### "Substantial" must be defined contextually---no universal definition of substantial

**Ferrera 7** (6-18, Lucas, LLP @ Finkelstein, Newman, Ferrera,
http://www.nyrealestatelawblog.com/2007/06/what_is_material_made_of_1.html.)

According to established precedent, **[terms]{.underline}**
**[like]{.underline}** \"material\" or \"**[substantial\" don\'t lend
themselves to a precise, all-encompassing definition]{.underline}**. Our
favorite quote on the topic can be found in the case of Park East Land
Corporation v. Finkelstein, 299 N.Y. 70 (1949), wherein our state\'s
highest court \-- the New York State Court of Appeals \-- noted as
follows: **[\'Substantial\' is a word of general reference which takes
on color and precision from its total context]{.underline}**. Having
little if any meaning when considered in abstract or in vacuum, **[it
must be defined with reference to the peculiar legal and factual setting
in which it occurs \.... In other words, what is \"substantial\" will
vary from case to case,]{.underline}** depending on the underlying facts
and circumstances. However, when the parties to a lease agree that
certain conduct will comprise a \"substantial obligation,\" or that
misconduct may be deemed a \"substantial breach,\" such private
agreements have been honored and enforced by the courts in the absence
of some statutory prohibition or affront to some public-policy
consideration.

#### In context, substantial can be 902 million.

**US GAO 18** \[United States Government Accountability Office, FOREIGN
MILITARY SALES Controls Should Be Strengthened to Address Substantial
Growth in Overhead Account Balances, May 2018
<https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692484.pdf>\] 7-1-2019

**[The FMS CAS Account Balance Has Grown Substantially]{.underline}**;
Management Controls over the Balance Remain Insufficient The CAS account
balance grew substantially between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 because
CAS collections exceeded expenditures in each year and insufficient
controls were in place to manage the balance. The account balances for
fiscal years 2016 and 2017 overstate available CAS funds due to a
systems issue and limited related oversight. Since fiscal year 2014,
DSCA has created some controls to help better manage this account;
however, DSCA does not plan to conduct timely comprehensive reviews of
the CAS fee rate, has inconsistently implemented internal guidance
related to calculating the minimum desired level for the account, and
has not established a method to calculate an upper bound of a target
range for the account, thus allowing the account to continue to grow.
The CAS Account Balance Grew Substantially between Fiscal Years 2007 and
2015; the Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 Account Balances Overstate
Available Funds The CAS account balance grew every fiscal year, **[from
\$69 million at the beginning of 2007 to \$981 million at the end of
2015]{.underline}**, or 1,329 percent over the period (see fig. 8). As
annual sales grew during this period, CAS collections and expenditures
also grew, but at slower rates than the account balance growth---at 133
percent and 187 percent, respectively. Figure 8: Foreign Military Sales
Contract Administration Services (CAS) Account Collections,
Expenditures, and Beginning and End of Year Balance, Fiscal Years (FY)
2007 to 2015 Note: Expenditures from the CAS account equal the amount of
funds transferred from the CAS account to implementing agencies to pay
for CAS bills submitted. These expenditures do not necessarily equal CAS
spending by implementing agencies as some implementing agencies may
delay in submitting their bills. CAS account collections exceeded
expenditures each fiscal year from 2007 through 2015, contributing to
the growing account balance. As shown in figure 9, collections were at
least double expenditures in five of these years, with a \$49 million
difference between collections and expenditures in fiscal year 2015.
DSCA reduced the CAS fee rate from 1.5 to 1.2 percent in 2014 due to
concerns over growth in the CAS account balance, according to DSCA
officials. After the rate reduction, the account balance continued to
grow but at a slower rate. The account balance increased 5 percent
during fiscal year 2015 compared with an average of 38 percent from
fiscal years 2006 through 2014. The balance would continue to grow if
this trend continues.

#### Substantial can be 0.3%

**US GAO 18** \[United States Government Accountability Office, FOREIGN
MILITARY SALES Controls Should Be Strengthened to Address Substantial
Growth in Overhead Account Balances, May 2018
<https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692484.pdf>\] 7-1-2019

The range of the estimated balance in each scenario gets larger from
year to year due to increasing uncertainty for longer-term projections.

Figure 7: Range of Foreign Military Sales Administrative Account Balance
Estimates and Balance above the Projected Safety Level Based on GAO
Modeling, Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 to 2024

![](media/image3.png){width="7.816666666666666in"
height="4.883333333333334in"}

Our modeling shows that, **[even with a substantially reduced
administrative fee rate]{.underline}**, the estimated administrative
account balance would likely well exceed the account's projected safety
level through at least fiscal year 2024. **[Even if DSCA reduced the fee
rate an additional 0.3 percent lower than it plans to as of June 2018,
we project the estimated balance of the administrative account would be
over \$1 billion above the account's safety level]{.underline}** in
fiscal year 2024.

#### DCS refers to any sale that is not FMS

**"LMDefense." LMDefense, 2013, lmdefense.com/direct-commercial-sales/.

DCS means that the U.S. defense company (the vendor) works directly with
the foreign government customer to negotiate, finalize, and deliver a
sale. The USG is not involved in the sale (although the vendor is
required to comply with U.S. regulations regarding military exports).
Basically, DCS is any sale not through the FMS/FMF system.

#### "Resolved" is legislative 

**Parcher 1** (Jeff Parcher 1, former debate coach at Georgetown, Feb
2001 http://www.ndtceda.com/archives/200102/0790.html)

Pardon me if I turn to a source besides Bill. **[American Heritage
Dictionary: Resolve]{.underline}**: 1. To make a firm decision about. 2.
To decide or express by formal vote. 3. To separate something into
constiutent parts See Syns at \*analyze\* (emphasis in orginal) 4. Find
a solution to. See Syns at \*Solve\* (emphasis in original) 5. To
dispel: resolve a doubt. - n 1. Firmness of purpose; resolution. 2. **[A
determination or decision]{.underline}**. (2) The very nature of the
word \"resolution\" makes it a question. American Heritage: A course of
action determined or decided on. A formal statement of a decision, as by
a legislature. (3) The resolution is obviously a question. Any other
conclusion is utterly inconceivable. Why? Context. The debate community
empowers a topic committee to write a topic for ALTERNATE side debating.
The committee is not a random group of people coming together to
\"reserve\" themselves about some issue. There is context - they are
empowered by a community to do something. In their deliberations, the
topic community attempts to craft a resolution which can be ANSWERED in
either direction. They focus on issues like ground and fairness because
they know the resolution will serve as the basis for debate which will
be resolved by determining the policy desirablility of that resolution.
That\'s not only what they do, but it\'s what we REQUIRE them to do. We
don\'t just send the topic committee somewhere to adopt their own group
resolution. It\'s not the end point of a resolution adopted by a body -
it\'s the preliminary wording of a resolution sent to others to be
answered or decided upon. (4) Further context: the word **[resolved is
used to emphasis the fact that it\'s policy debate. Resolved comes from
the adoption of resolutions by legislative bodies]{.underline}**. A
resolution is either adopted or it is not. **[It\'s a question before a
legislative body]{.underline}**. Should this statement be adopted or
not. (5) The very terms \'affirmative\' and \'negative\' support my
view. One affirms a resolution. Affirmative and negative are the
equivalents of \'yes\' or \'no\' - which, of course, are answers to a
question.

### Resolved -- Plan Text

#### **Most predictable---the** [agent and verb]{.underline} **indicate a debate about** [hypothetical government action]{.underline}

Jon M **Ericson 3**, Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts --
California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater's Guide, Third Edition,
p. 4

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
[each topic contains certain key elements]{.underline}, although they
have slightly different functions from comparable elements of
value-oriented propositions[. 1. An agent doing the acting \-\--"The
United States" in "The United States should adopt]{.underline} a policy
of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value,
[the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb
*should*]{.underline}---the first part of a verb phrase [that urges
action]{.underline}. 3. An action verb to follow should in the
should-verb combination. [For example, *should adopt*]{.underline} here
**[means to put a]{.underline}** program or **[policy into action though
governmental means]{.underline}**. 4. A specification of directions or a
limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example,
gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example,
eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic
recognition, or discuscsing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy
deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. [The **entire
debate** is about whether something ought to occur.]{.underline} What
you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a
debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to
perform the future action that you propose.

### Resolved -- Opening

#### Resolved means opening possibility for emotive or instrumental response. 

**Turner and Avison,** **'92** -- Harvie Branscomb Chair and Professor
of Sociology, Professor of Psychiatry at Vanderbilt and Professor of
Sociology at Western (R. Jay and William R. "Innovations in the
Measurement of Life Stress: Crisis Theory and the Significance of Event
Resolution," Journal of Health and Social Behavior, Vol. 33, No. 1
(Mar., 1992), pp. 36-50)

Erikson's (1959) formulation emphasizes the individual's constant and
active inter- course with the environment as crucial for development.
Problems are encountered and resolved, with varying degrees of success.
**[Erikson's use of the term resolved]{.underline}** or resolution in
describing a successful crisis outcome **[does not seem to imply that
the issue is solved]{.underline}** or **[cleared up.]{.underline}**
Rather, **[it refers to a temporary or- enduring positive decision or
settling in relation to the personal meanings of the
event.]{.underline}** For Erikson, **[a positive balance is achieved
between alternative self attitudes that are experienced as senses of how
and who one is.]{.underline}** The criteria for these senses are "a
crisis, beset with fears, or at least a general anxiousness or tension,
seems to be resolved, in that the child suddenly seems to 'grow
together' both psychologically and physi- cally" (Erikson 1959, p. 75).
**[When resolved, the individual may emerge from these engagements with
a new skill, conﬁdence, or other enabling self attitude that is added to
his or her repertoire of responses or coping mechanisms.]{.underline}**
This then increases the probabil- ity of success in future encounters.
**[The developmental process thus may involve a synthesizing of new
experiences into an evolving self perception and/or the accumulation of
skills or strategies for instrumental or emotional
response.]{.underline}** While **[Erikson]{.underline}** speciﬁcally
**[used the term "vulnerability" to characterize the major corollary of
crisis experiences, he implies a meaning that might better be described
as]{.underline}** openness-**[openness to both harm and
enhancement.]{.underline}** This is evident from his contention that
personality growth occurs through the resolution of normative crises and
hence that the disequilibria which characterize these crises offer
potential for forward developmental leaps as well as vulnerability.

Constitution limits the powers of the Federal Government to the powers
assigned to it; all powers not expressly assigned to the Federal
Government are reserved to the States or to the people.

**Wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States)**

**[The government of the United States of America is the federal
government]{.underline}** of the constitutional republic of fifty states
that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and
several other territories. **[The federal government is composed of
three distinct branches: legislative, executive and
judicia]{.underline}**l, **[whose powers are vested]{.underline}** by
the U.S. Constitution **[in the Congress, the President, and the federal
courts]{.underline}**, including the Supreme Court, respectively; **[the
powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of
Congress]{.underline}**, including the creation of executive departments
and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.¶ The full name of the republic
is \"The United States of America\". No other name appears in the
Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties,
and in legal cases to which it is a party (e.g., Charles T. Schenck v.
United States). **[The terms]{.underline}** \"Government of the United
States of America\" or \"United States Government\" are often used in
official documents to **[represent the federal government as distinct
from the states]{.underline}** collectively. In casual conversation or
writing, the term \"Federal Government\" is often used, and the term
\"National Government\" is sometimes used. The terms \"Federal\" and
\"National\" in government agency or program names generally indicates
affiliation with the federal government (e.g., Federal Bureau of
Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, etc.).
Because the seat of government is in Washington, D.C., \"Washington\" is
commonly used as a metonym for the federal government.

## Should

### Should -- Enact a plan

#### Should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan

**American Heritage Dictionary 2000** (Dictionary.com)

should. [The will to do something]{.underline} or have something take
place: I shall go out if I feel like it.

### Should -- Mandatory

#### "Should" is mandatory

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009
People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

\"[Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"**should\"**]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"**should\" in** an
instruction]{.underline} on witness credibility [which used the word
\"must\" because the two words have the **same meaning**]{.underline}.
State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a
child support statute, [the Arizona Court]{.underline} of Appeals
[concluded **that a** legislature\'s or commission\'s use of the word
\"should\" is meant to convey **duty** or **obligation**]{.underline}.
McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d 300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002)
(finding a statute stating that child support expenditures \"should\" be
allocated for the purpose of parents\' federal tax exemption to be
mandatory).

####  "Should" means must -- its mandatory

**Foresi 32** (Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis)

**[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline}** is not only an auxiliary verb, it
**[is]{.underline}** also **[the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and
has for one of its meanings as]{.underline}** defined in the Century
Dictionary: \"**[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought
(to); used with an infinitive]{.underline}** (without to) **[to express
obligation, necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be
carried out.\"]{.underline}** We think it clear that it is in that sense
that the word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When
the judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from
all the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is
guilty of the offense charged, they should acquit**[, the word
\'should\' is not used in an advisory sense but has the force or meaning
of \'must\', or \'ought to\' and carries]{.underline}** \[\*\*\*8\]
**[with it the sense of]{.underline}** \[\*313\] **[obligation and duty
equivalent to compulsion]{.underline}**. A natural sense of sympathy for
a few unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something
in direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to fritter away,
or nullify, provisions which have been enacted to safeguard and protect
the welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of
mining.

Other legislated DA earmarks in the FY2005 appropriations bill are

(\$25 million), the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program (\$20
million), women's leadership capacity (\$15 million), the International
Fertilizer Development Center (\$2.3 million), and clean water treatment
(\$2 million). Interestingly, in the wording of the bill, Congress uses
the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.
[The **difference** between *shall* and *should* may have **legal
significance**---one is clearly **mandatory** while the other is a

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of

it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the
trial judge\'s intent must be garnered from the four corners of the

### Should -- Not immediate

[should]{.underline}    /ʃʊd/ Show Spelled\[shood\] Show IPA --auxiliary
verb 1. pt. of shall. 2. ([used to express condition]{.underline}): Were
he to arrive, I should be pleased. 3. must; ought (used to indicate
duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that. 4. would (used
to make a statement less direct or blunt): I should think you would
apologize. Use should in a Sentence See images of should Search should
on the Web Origin: ME sholde, OE sc ( e ) olde; see shall ---Can be
confused:  could, should, would (see usage note at this entry ).
---Synonyms 3. See must1 . ---[Usage note]{.underline} Rules similar to
those for choosing between shall and will have long been advanced for
should and would, but again the rules have had little effect on usage.
In most constructions, would is the auxiliary chosen regardless of the
person of the subject: If our allies would support the move, we would
abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised at the
complexity of the directions. Because the main function of should in
modern American English is to express duty, necessity, etc. ( You should
get your flu shot before winter comes ), its use for other purposes, as
to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I
should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an
affectation to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite
common in British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would
) have called immediately. I should (American would ) really prefer a
different arrangement. As with shall and will, most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbook rule in making a
choice between should and would. [See also shall.]{.underline} Shall

### Should -- Desirable

#### "Should" means desirable \-\-- this does not have to be a mandate

**AC 99** (Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html)

shall

**[\'shall\' describes something that is mandatory]{.underline}**. If a
requirement uses \'shall\', then that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied
without fail. Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply with one
single \'shall\' is sufficient reason to reject the entire product.
Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances. Examples: \#
\"Requirements shall make use of the word \'shall\' only where
compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good example. \# \"C++ code shall
have comments every 5th line.\" This is a bad example. Using \'shall\'
here is too strong.

should

**[\'should\' is weaker. It describes something that might not be
satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable
enough]{.underline}** that any noncompliance shall be explicitly
justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined carefully, as it
probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a
\'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be discarded entirely,
so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should be ANSI compliant.\"
A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all
platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be tested thoroughly.\"
Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with \'shall\' if this
requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what
\'thoroughly\' means).

#### "Should" doesn't require certainty

**Black's Law 79** (Black's Law Dictionary -- Fifth Edition, p. 1237)

**[Should]{.underline}**. The past tense of shall; ordinarily implying
duty or obligation; although usually no more than an obligation of
propriety or expediency, or a moral obligation, thereby distinguishing
it from "ought." It is not normally synonymous with "may," and although
often interchangeable with the word "would," it **[does not ordinarily
express certainty as "will" sometimes does. ]{.underline}**

### Misc

## Substantially

### Percentage

#### Substantially must be at least 90%.

**Words and Phrases '01** (Cumulative Supplemental Pamphlet, v. 40, p.
946)

The word "substantially" as used in provision of Unemployment
Compensation Act that experience rating of an employer may be
transferred to an employing unit which acquires the organization, trade
or business, or "**[substantially]{.underline}**" all of the assets
thereof, **[is an elastic term, which does not include a definite, fixed
amount of percentage, and]{.underline}** the transfer **[does not have
to be 100 per cent but cannot be less than 90 per cent in the ordinary
situation.]{.underline}**

### Large

#### Substantial Means "Large"

**O**xford **E**nglish **D**ictionary, 2^nd^ Ed, **1989**

**[\[substantial:\] Of ample or considerable amount]{.underline}**,
quantity, or dimensions. More recently also in a somewhat weakened
sense, **[esp. 'fairly large.']{.underline}**

### Substantially -- W/O Material Qualification

#### Substantially is without material qualification

**North Carolina Court of Appeals 3**
(http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/coa/opinions/1999/980989-1.htm)

For the New York offense of driving while ability impaired to qualify as
\"substantially equivalent\" to the North Carolina offense of driving
while under the influence of an impairing substance, the respective
statutes need not be identical in each and every respect. [Substantially
is defined as]{.underline} \"\[e\]ssentially; [without material
qualification]{.underline}\[.\]\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 1428 (6th ed.
1990).

### Substantially -- No Precise Percentages

#### No precise percentage standard for a substantial reduction -- 20% is a good cut-off

**Supreme Court of Arkansas 2** (12-18,
http://courts.state.ar.us/opinions/2002b/20021218/e01-293.html)

Unemployment compensation \-- statement by Board of Review as to when
substantial reduction in pay is good cause for quitting employment \--
consistent with previous holding by court of appeals. \-- The Board of
Review stated that the general rule was that a substantial pay reduction
gives an employee good cause for quitting; the Board found that [there
was no set percentage or bright-line rule that made a reduction in pay
\"substantial]{.underline}\"; however, the weight of authority appeared
to be that [a reduction of over twenty percent was so substantial as to
compel an employee to quit a job and have good cause to do so, but a
reduction of less than twenty percent was not]{.underline}; the Board\'s
decision was consistent with the appellate court\'s earlier holding that
[there was no talismanic percentage figure that separated a substantial
reduction in salary from one that was not.]{.underline}

#### Substantially is imprecise -- 10-20% is sufficient

**Army Logistics Management College 98** (12-22,
https://akss.dau.mil/askaprof-akss/qdetail2.aspx?cgiSubjectAreaID=7&cgiQuestionID=2688)

The FAR states that best value procurements can be awarded based upon
adequate price competition if the offeror provides the greatest value to
the Government and price is a substantial factor in source selection.
Has the term \"**[substantial]{.underline}** factor\" been defined?
Since price is only one element to be scored (in addition to technical,
management, etc.) could a situation where price **[represents
10%]{.underline}** of the overall best value score be \"substantial\"?
**[20%? There is no published guidance on what is
\"substantial]{.underline}**.\" **[It can]{.underline}** best **[be
defined as whatever]{.underline}** the contracting officer or Program
Executive decide substantial is. In FAR 15.304 (c) it states \"The
evaluation factors and significant subfactors that apply to an
acquisition and their relative importance are within the broad
discretion of agency acquisition officials\...\...\" Rationale: The
question asks for a definition that is highly subjective in nature. One
of the acquisition improvements that has come about is that the
contracting/program personnel are empowered to make determinations
within a broader scope of their authority.

**Words and Phrases 1971**

**[The term substantial is relative and its meaning is to be gauged by
the circumstances.]{.underline}**

#### Substantially is a term that must be used in context.

**CJS '83** (Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 83)

**[Substantially: A relative and elastic term which should be
interpreted in accordance with the context in which it is
used.]{.underline}** While it must be employed with care and
discrimination, it must, nevertheless, be given effect.

#### Substantially is context-dependent -- Reasonability is critical 

**Commonwealth of Australia 8**
(http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/816379?pageDefinitionItemId=86167)

In various cases '**[substantial' has been defined as large, weighty,
big, real or of substance, or not insubstantial. It is not
straightforward. Its meaning depends on the context]{.underline}**. It
is an important concept in trade practices law because it arises in so
many provisions. Many sections of the Act will only be breached where
the effect or likely effect of the conduct will be to 'substantially
lessen competition in a market'. The term 'substantial' is used
elsewhere in the Act, for example: deciding whether a merger would
result in a substantial lessening of competition in a substantial market
in determining whether a corporation has misused its market power, it
must first be established that the corporation has a substantial degree
of power in the relevant market in determining whether goods are a
product of Australia, whether they have been substantially transformed.
Basically, **[the term must be understood in a relative sense---whether
the effect in question is important or weighty in relation to the size
of the particular market.]{.underline}** In Stirling Harbour Services
Pty Ltd v Bunbury Port Authority \[2000\] FCA 38; (2000) ATPR 41-752
Justice French said that to work out whether competition is being
substantially lessened 'there \[must\] be a purpose, effect or likely
effect of the impugned conduct on competition which is substantial in
the sense of meaningful or relevant to the competitive process'.

### Substantially -- Quality, Not Quantity

#### Substantially relates to quality, not quantity

**Design & Artists Copyright Society 3**
(http://www.dacs.org.uk/index.php?c=86&m=5&s=5.)

Copyright is infringed when an individual carries out one of the
copyright owner\'s exclusive rights (see FAQ 5 above) without the
permission of the copyright owner in relation to the whole or a
substantial part of the artistic work. **[The test to determine what is
substantial is a qualitative test and not a quantitative one. This means
that there may be an infringement even if a small but distinctive
portion of the original artwork was copied.]{.underline}**

#### More ev... 

**Lands 99** (Robert, 12-1, Finer Stephens Innocent Solicitors,
http://www.theaoi.com/Mambo/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=226&Itemid=26)

If you copy the whole of another person's work, you will probably
infringe their copyright. You will probably infringe their copyright if
you copy a substantial part of another's work. **[What is substantial is
determined by the quality of the portion used, not just the
quantity]{.underline}**. In other words, if you copy the most important
part of a work, it will be substantial even if it's only a small
percentage of the whole.

### Substantially -- Day to Day

#### Substantially - USFG must participate in day to day actions to be substantial

US Code Online

(Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart 3.1---Safeguards,
http://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%203_1.html)

[(3) "Participating substantially" means that the official's involvement
is of significance to the matter. Substantial participation requires
more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement,
or involvement on an administrative or peripheral issue]{.underline}.
Participation may be substantial even though it is not determinative of
the outcome of a particular matter. Sdsd [A finding of substantiality
should be based not only on the effort devoted to a matter, but on the
importance of the effort. While a series of peripheral involvements may
be insubstantial, the single act of approving or participating in a
critical step may be substantial. However, the review of procurement
documents solely to determine compliance with regulatory,
administrative, or budgetary procedures, does not constitute substantial
participation in a procurement.]{.underline}

### Overt

#### Substantial means overt

**Words & Phrases '64**

(40 W&P 759)

The words outward, open, actual, visible, **[substantial]{.underline}**,
and exclusive, in connection with a change of possession, mean
substantially the same thing. They **[mean not concealed; not
hidden]{.underline}**; exposed to view; free from concealment,
dissimulation, reserve, or disguise; in full existence; denoting that
which not merely can be, but is opposed to potential, apparent,
constructive, and imaginary; veritable; genuine; certain; absolute; real
at present time, as a matter of fact, not merely nominal; opposed to
form; actually existing; true; not including, admitting, or pertaining
to any others; undivided; sole; opposed to inclusive.

## Reduce

### Reduce -- Net Decrease

#### Reduce means a [net decrease]{.underline}

**Public Law 87-253** (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, 97th
US Congress, Sept 8, 1982, Lexis)

E\) Prior to approving any application for a refund, the Secretary shall

expansion]{.underline}** of production **[in]{.underline}** other
production facilities in which the person has an interest or by transfer
of partial interest in the produc- tion facility or by the taking of
**[any other action]{.underline}**. which is a scheme or device to
qualify for payment.

#### Reduce means [net decrease in the region]{.underline}

#### Reduce means to make smaller.

**[Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 2008]{.underline}**, Twelfth
Edition, Oxford Reference Online

[Reduce]{.underline} v.

1\. [make or become **smaller or less in amount, degree, or**

4\. (Chemistry) cause to combine chemically with hydrogen. • undergo or
cause to undergo a reaction in which electrons are gained from another
substance or molecule. The opposite of oxidize.

5\. restore (a dislocated body part) to its proper position.

### Reduce -- Not transfer

#### This means the plan must [explicitly preclude]{.underline} intra-regional transfer

**Kentucky Ct of Appeals 84**

(Paducah v. Moore, 662 S.W.2d 491, Lexis\-\--sex edited)

No one quarrels with the appellants\' argument that HN3 the city has the
power to transfer or even discharge employees at will. The right to do
so, however, is restricted by Statutes of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
The language of KRS 90.360(1) above is quite clear in prohibiting
reduction in grade of a classified service employee of the City except
for cause and after a hearing upon appropriate written charges. In
interpreting identical language concerning prohibition against reduction
in grade provided for in KRS 95.450(1), our former Court of Appeals
stated in Schrichte vs. Bornhorn, Ky., 376 S.W.2d 683 (1964):∂ . . . we
are of the opinion that the term \'grade\' means rank, whereas it
appears that the appellant interprets it more broadly as job
classification. **[Obviously by the use of the word \'reduce,\' the
Statute envisages a verticle scale. If a \[person\] is
transferred]{.underline}** without a loss in pay **[from one job
category to another]{.underline}** with comparable authority, his
**[classification is changed, but]{.underline}** his grade
**[is]{.underline}** **[not reduced]{.underline}**.

### Reduce -- Not Eliminate

#### Reduce excludes eliminate

**Words and Phrases 02** (vol 36B, p. 80)

Mass. 1905. Rev.Laws, c.203, § 9, provides that, if two or more cases
are tried together in the superior court, the presiding judge may
"reduce" the witness fees and other costs, but "not less than the
ordinary witness fees, and other costs recoverable in one of the cases"
which are so tried together shall be allowed. Held that, in reducing the
costs, the amount in all the cases together is to be considered and
reduced, providing that there must be left in the aggregate an amount
not less than the largest sum recoverable in any of the cases. **[The
word "reduce," in its ordinary signification, does not mean to cancel,
destroy, or bring to naught, but to diminish, lower, or bring to an
inferior state.]{.underline}**---Green v. Sklar, 74 N.E. 595, 188 Mass.
363.

### Reduce -- Not Replace

**Reduce excludes replace**

**[Decker, 84]{.underline}** \-- US District Court senior judge

\[Bernard Martin, Dean A. MATTHEWS, Plaintiff v. ALLIS-CHALMERS,
Defendant, No. 83 C 7843, US District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, 9-5-1984, l/n, accessed 8-1-15\]

In age discrimination discharge cases, [courts]{.underline} have
[required a plaintiff to show]{.underline} that he is in the protected
age group, that he was satisfying the legitimate business expectations
of the employer, that he was nevertheless fired, and that ~~he was~~
\[[they were\] replaced by a younger person]{.underline}. [The last
element has no role in a reduction-in-force case]{.underline}. [**By
definition, when an employer reduces \[their**\]]{.underline} ~~his~~
**[work force]{.underline}**, ~~he hires~~ **\[[they hire\] no one to
replace the ones \[they let go\]]{.underline}** ~~he lets go~~. The
question is whether to require plaintiffs to show more than their age,
qualifications, and termination.

### Reduce -- Change

**Reduce means change**

**[CLEVELAND INDUS. SQUARE, INC]{.underline}**. v. BD. OF ZON. APP., 83
Ohio App. 3d 301 - Ohio: Court of Appeals, Cuyahoga
19**[92]{.underline}**

\"Incineration\" means to incinerate. Webster\'s New World Dictionary
(1983) 306. \"Incinerate\" means \"to burn to ashes; to burn up.\" Id.
\"Reduction\" means to reduce. Id. at 501. \"**[Reduce\" means \"to
lessen,\" or \"to change to a different form.\"]{.underline}** Id.\"
Here, Paul Beno and former Attorney General Celebrezze testified that
\"incineration\" occurred within the destructive distillation process.
Beno testified that the process involves \"incineration\" of garbage
because the gaseous byproducts, of the garbage are burned. Section
345.04, however, contemplates burning of the garbage itself, not its
by-products. Former Attorney General Celebrezze testified that
\"incineration\" occurs because heat is applied to reduce the waste. The
ordinary meaning of incineration, however, contemplates burning, not
merely the application of heat. Accordingly, the city failed to
demonstrate that \"incineration\" occurred in the process. Conversely,
Fioritto and Walsh testified that the process does not involve
\"incineration\" because the absence of oxygen from the garbage
precludes \"burning,\" only indirect heat is applied, and carbon char
rather than ash is created. This testimony constituted a preponderance
of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that the process does
not involve \"incineration.\" 308\*308 The city did establish, however,
through Beno, that the process does reduce both the volume and weight of
the garbage which fuels the destructive distillation, and both Fioritto
and Walsh admitted on cross-examination that reduction does occur.
Accordingly, there is a preponderance of reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence that \"reduction\" does occur within the process,
and it is therefore not a permitted use under Section 345.04(c)(2)(I).

## Foreign Military Sales

#### FMS is the exclusive program for transferring government defense equipment to foreign countries.

**DSCA 18** \[Defense Security Cooperation Agency, 5-27-2018, Accessible
Online at <https://www.dsca.mil/resources/faq>\] DL 7-1-2019

Foreign Military Sales (**[FMS]{.underline}**) **[is the
U.S]{.underline}**. Government's **[program for transferring defense
articles, services, and training to]{.underline}** our **[international
partners]{.underline}** and international organizations. The FMS program
is funded by administrative charges to foreign purchasers and is
operated at no cost to taxpayers. The Defense Security Cooperation
Agency (**[DSCA]{.underline}**) **[administers]{.underline}** the
**[FMS]{.underline}** program **[for the]{.underline}** Department of
Defense (**[DoD]{.underline}**). Under FMS, the U.S. government uses
DoD's acquisition system to procure defense articles and services on
behalf of its partners. **[Eligible countries]{.underline}** may
**[purchase defense articles]{.underline}** and services **[with their
own funds or]{.underline}** with **[funds provided
through]{.underline}** U.S. government-sponsored **[assistance
programs]{.underline}**. In certain cases, defense articles may be
obtained through grants or leases. Who can participate in the FMS
program? **[The President designates countries]{.underline}** and
international organizations **[eligible to participate]{.underline}** in
FMS. **[The D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[S]{.underline}**tate **[approves]{.underline}** individual programs
**[on a case-by-case basis]{.underline}**. Currently, some 179 countries
and international organizations participate in FMS. Are there other ways
to obtain U.S. defense articles and services? Yes. International
**[partners may obtain]{.underline}** U.S. **[defense
articles]{.underline}** and services **[through]{.underline}** direct
commercial sales (**[DCS]{.underline}**). Under DCS rules, **[U.S.
companies obtain]{.underline}** commercial **[export licenses from the
D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f **[S]{.underline}**tate,
**[allowing them to]{.underline}** negotiate with, and **[sell directly
to,]{.underline}** our **[partners]{.underline}**. As with FMS, DCS are
subject to applicable U.S. exports laws and regulations and the approval
of the Department of State. Does FMS Compete with DCS? FMS and DCS are
not in competition. Unless an item has been designated as "FMS only,"
DoD is generally neutral as to whether countries purchase U.S. defense
articles or services commercially or through FMS. If a purchaser
requests FMS data after soliciting bids from contractors, the purchaser
must demonstrate that commercial acquisition efforts have ceased before
any FMS data will be provided. If the purchaser obtains FMS data and
later determines to request a commercial price quote, the FMS offer may
be withdrawn. What are the advantages of FMS and DCS? All sales of
defense articles and services are subject to similar technology release
approvals, retransfer assurances, and congressional review In general,
FMS purchase with U.S. forces; provide contract administrative services
that may not be available through the private sector; and may help lower
unit costs by consolidating purchases for FMS customers with those of
DoD. Major FMS programs also nurture long-term relationships with the
U.S. military, including access to joint training and doctrine and
increased opportunities for interoperability with U.S. forces. Under
FMS, the customer is assured that the acquisition process will be
subject to DoD's standards through every step of the process. Under DCS,
our international partners work directly with U.S. companies. This
allows our partners more direct involvement during contract negotiation
and may allow firm-fixed pricing. It may also be better suited to
fulfilling requirements for non-standard items that are not, or are no
longer, in DoD's inventory. How can I compare costs between FMS and DCS?
Cost comparisons between FMS and DCS are often not possible, as the
contracts are not identical. FMS uses the total package approach to its
contracts. This means that an FMS buy for a major system includes
training, spare parts, and other support needed to sustain a system
through its first few years. DCS contracts may or may not include this
in the initial pricing. Although it includes administrative charges, the
FMS sale will always benefit from the economies of scale and experience
the U.S. government has with a system. Do FMS Sales require
Congressional Notification? The U.S. **[A]{.underline}**rms

**[For all other countries there is a 30-day]{.underline}** statutory

Nonrecurring costs (NCs) are those one-time costs incurred in support of
previous research, development, or production of certain major defense
equipment. (DoD Directive (DoDD) 2140.2: \"Recoupment of Nonrecurring
Costs (NCs) on Sales of U.S. Item). They are \"sunk costs,\" in that the
U.S. Government pays them in order to develop or produce a given defense
article or weapons system specifically for the U.S. armed forces. DoD
may waive NCs on FMS cases if: 1) The sale would significantly advance
U.S. Government interests in NATO standardization, standardization with
the Armed Forces of Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Israel or
New Zealand, or foreign production in the United States under
coproduction arrangements (waive or reduce); or (2) Imposition of the
charge likely would result in the loss of the sale (waive only); or (3)
The increase in quantity resulting from the sale would result in a
reduced unit cost for the same item being procured by the U.S.
Government (waive only).

#### FMS is the transfer of defense equipment purchased by foreign countries.

FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS)

**[Under FMS,]{.underline}** **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates government **[manages the transfer
of]{.underline}** approximately \$43 billion per year of **[defense
equipment purchased by foreign allies]{.underline}** and partners. The
Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers in the Department of
State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM/RSAT) manages the FMS
process, in close partnership with the Department of Defense's Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which implements FMS cases by
working through the military services to negotiate with U.S. defense
contractors, and by providing the customer with training, sustainment,
and contractor logistics support for the lifetime of the sale.

The **[FMS sales process begins when a country submits a]{.underline}**
formal **[Letter of Request]{.underline}** (LOR) **[that specifies a
desired military capability and]{.underline}** a rough
**[price]{.underline}**. **[Sales are approved following U.S. government
review and after Congressional notification]{.underline}**, when
required. **[After the sale is approved, the DSCA issues a Letter of
Offer and Acceptance]{.underline}** (LOA) that specifies the exact
defense articles, training, and support to be delivered.

**[Processing time for FMS cases may vary, but they may take months to
negotiate]{.underline}**, especially for major defense articles that
require modifications to standard U.S. systems. Due primarily to the
time required to construct sophisticated defense systems such as fighter
aircraft, countries often do not take delivery of the full package until
years after the LOA is finalized. Major FMS sales that have been
formally notified to Congress are publicly announced on the DSCA
website.

## Direct Commerical Sales

#### DCS is the sale of USML technologies between US companies and foreign countries approved by the DDTC

DIRECT COMMERCIAL SALES (DCS)

**[Under DCS]{.underline}**, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs'
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (PM/**[DDTC]{.underline}**)
**[provides regulatory approvals for]{.underline}** more than \$136
billion per year in **[sales of defense equipment, services, and related
manufacturing technologies controlled under the]{.underline}** 21
categories of the U.S. Munitions List (**[USML]{.underline}**). **[These
sales are negotiated privately between foreign end-users and U.S.
companies.]{.underline}**

Under U.S. law, any U.S. company or individual involved in certain
activities involving items enumerated on the USML is required to receive
an approved export license or other approval before providing any USML
regulated item, technical data, or service to a foreign end-user.

As with FMS, export licenses approved under DCS are approved following
an intensive U.S. government review, and after Congressional
notification, as required. Export licenses are valid up to four years.
Authorizations for defense services are also required and may be for
longer timeframes. They may be extended or amended as needed.

DCS cases are considered to be proprietary agreements between the
foreign governments or companies and the U.S. defense contractor,
however certain information about cases notified to Congress is
published quarterly in the Federal Register, in fulfillment of
requirements in the Arms Export Control Act.

## Topicality Impacts

#### Topic education---arms sales determine US foreign policy and public knowledge and mobilization is necessary to challenge it

**Cutter 19** \[Jane Cutter, Los Angeles high school students lead rally
for Yemen, Liberation News, 4-24-2019, Accessible Online at
https://www.liberationnews.org/los-angeles-high-school-students-lead-rally-for-yemen/\]
7-1-2019

On the afternoon of April 20, Malibu **[High School]{.underline}**'s
Relief for Yemen club led a **[demonstration]{.underline}** at the LA
Federal Building, protesting President Donald Trump's veto of a
congressional resolution to withdraw US Armed forces from hostilities in
Yemen. The bill, with bipartisan support would go a long way towards
ending the horrifying Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen, which has
already taken over 70,000 lives, and pushed over half of its population
-- a staggering fourteen million -- into what the UN calls deadly
"pre-famine conditions," the "world's worst famine in over 100 years."
Liberation News spoke to Relief for Yemen presidents Theo Detweiler and
Luke Lindstrom about the development of the club. They told us that the
organization started out as a group of concerned friends, but grew after
activities such as flyering, social media promotion, and a fundraising
effort for humanitarian aid to Yemen. Relief for Yemen plans to continue
with anti-war grassroots organizations in future protests. The event,
named the LA Rally Against U.S. Intervention in Yemen, was co-sponsored
by Relief for Yemen, Code Pink and ANSWER Coalition. The rally was also
endorsed by United for Peace and Justice, the Harriet Tubman Center for
Social Justice, March and Rally LA, Courage to Resist, the Los Angeles
Green Party, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, Abby Martin of the
Empire Files, the Socialist Unity Party and International Action Center.
Representatives from the different organizations displayed signs to busy
Wilshire traffic, bearing messages that included "How many lives per
gallon?" and "80,000 children's dreams destroyed." Theo Detweiler, one
**[of]{.underline}** the co-presidents of Relief for Yemen at Malibu
High School, was the first to take the megaphone at the rally, and began
by condemning the almost non-existent reporting carried by corporate
media outlets during Yemen's U.S.-caused famine. "This is **[the
everyday reality in Yemen]{.underline}**, but it was the only story
mainstream media outlet MSNBC ran on the crisis for nearly two years,
all the while reporting on Stormy Daniels 455 times over the same
period. That's shameful! "And **[what does it say about American values
that we're supplying arms to such an oppressive regime \[in Saudi
Arabia\], while underfunding education, green energy and
healthcare?]{.underline}** This is not what the people want. We demand
an end to the blockade and the disregard for human life, and we demand
an end to the arms sales. We, the people, demand an end to this
genocide." Carley Towne, a member of the anti-war organization Code Pink
spoke about the role of major U.S. defense companies, such as Boeing,
Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, and Raytheon in the war. These
gigantic monopolies -- otherwise known as **[the military-industrial
complex -- rake in tens of billions of dollars a year in profits
producing the machinery of death, and comprise a huge lobbying group
pushing wars like those in Yemen. "The reason why we go to war is for
profit. The reason why the U.S. is interested in maintaining the war on
Yemen is simple but important. U.S. weapons manufacturers sell millions
in weapons to Saudi Arabia, and as long as there's money to make, there
will be war. Even though it leads to the world's worst humanitarian
crisis]{.underline}**, even though both the House and the Senate has
voted to invoke the War Powers Act and end U.S. aid to Saudi Arabia,
Donald Trump used his second veto to block legislation and make sure
that his powerful friends continue to make money from war around the
world." Nicholas Avedisian-Cohen, an **[activist]{.underline}** from the
ANSWER Coalition, detailed what we know about the effects of the U.S.
war. "The Saudi/American/UK/UAE/Qatari war coalition has bombed
funerals, hospitals, water treatment facilities, and food storage sites
-- leading in 2016 to a pre-modern cholera epidemic spreading at a rate
of 5,000 new cases each day, all while the U.S. Navy has been enforcing
an inhuman blockade of a country that, pre-war, imported 80 percent of
its food supplies ... this depravity, using starvation and disease as
weapons of war, is an attempt to devastate Yemenis into submission ...
this is because at the end of day, this war is being waged against Yemen
to further U.S. dominance in the Middle East." He
**[connect]{.underline}**ed **[the struggle against U.S. military
aggression in Yemen to the anti-imperialist movements around the
world]{.underline}**. "The Yemeni struggle to live in dignity, is for
us, the most inspiring act of resistance, part of an ongoing global
struggle against imperialism that we are determined to be on the right
side of -- in whatever small way. This is the least we owe to Yemenis
and everyone else in the world who is existentially threatened by
American militarism." In her speech, Abby Martin of teleSUR's
documentary series The Empire Files **[point]{.underline}**ed **[out the
necessity for maintaining the grassroots anti-war movement rather than
relying on the good intentions of U.S. administrators.]{.underline}**
"Trump has already said that nothing will stop the cash flow to his
friends in Saudi Arabia. They \[Congress\] can't stop that \$100 billion
weapons deal! They can't stop the blood money flowing to Boeing and
Lockheed Martin. That's what the basis of U.S. capitalism is about: US
empire. It's predicated on blood money, on oil money. **[They're not
going to stop until we demand an end]{.underline}** to this system. An
end to this war and so many others waged by the US empire must come from
actions like these. Mobilizations from the masses, occupying space,
demanding it: U.S. out of Yemen!"

### Switching Sides Good

#### Switch Side Debate builds critical thinking skills which are key to foster democratic values and prevent extinction. 

**Harrigan 08 \[(Casey, Master of Arts in the Department of
Communications at Wake Forest University) "A Defense of Switch Side
Debate", 2008,
<http://wakespace.lib.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/14746/harrigancd_05_2008.pdf>\]**

While such pragmatic justifications for SSD are persuasive, they are
admittedly secondary to the greater consideration of pedagogy. Although
it is certainly true that debate is a game and that its competitive
elements are indispensable sources of motivation for students who are
otherwise apathetic about academic endeavors, **[the overwhelming
benefits of contest debating are the knowledge and skills taught through
participation. The wins and losses (and marginally-cheesy
trophies)]{.underline}**, by and large, are quickly forgotten with the
passage of time**[. However, the educational values of debate are so
fundamental that they eventually become ingrained in the decision-making
and thought processes of debaters, giving them a uniquely valuable
durability. To this end, SSD is essential.]{.underline}** The benef its
of debating both sides have been noted by many authors over the past
fifty years. To name but a few, **[SSD has been lauded for fostering
tolerance and undermining bigotry and dogmatism]{.underline}** (M uir,
1993), **[creating stronger and more knowledgeable
advocates]{.underline}** (Dybvig and Iversion, 2000) , **[and fortifying
the social forces of democracy by guaranteeing the expression of
minority viewpoints]{.underline}** (Day, 1966). **[Switching sides is a
crucial element of debate's pedagogical benefit; it forms the gears that
drive debate's intellectual motor. Additionally, there are social
benefits to the practice of requiring students to debate both sides of
controversial issues.]{.underline}** Dating back to th e Greek
rhetorical tradition, **[great value has been placed on the benefit of
testing each argument relative to all others in the marketplace of
ideas.]{.underline}** Like those who argue on behalf of the
efficiency-maximizing benefits of free market competition, it is
believed that **[arguments are most rigorously tested (and conceivably
refined and improved) when compared to all available alternatives. Even
for beliefs that have seem ingly been ingrained in consensus opinion or
7 in cases where the public at-large is unlikely to accept a particular
position, it has been argued that they should remain open for public
discussion and deliberation]{.underline}** (Mill, 1975). **[Along these
lines, the greatest benefit of switching sides, which goes to the heart
of contemporary debate, is its inducement of critical
thinking]{.underline}**. Defined as "reasonable reflective thinking that
is focused on decidi ng what to believe or do" (Ennis, 1987, p. 10),
**[critical thinking learned through debate teaches students not just
how to advocate and argue, but how to decide as well. Each and every
student, whether in debate or (more likely) at some later point in life,
will be placed in the position of the decision-maker. Faced with
competing options whose costs and benefits are initially unclear,
critical thinking is necessary to assess all the possible outcomes of
each choice, compare their relative merits, and arrive at some final
decision about which is preferable.]{.underline}** In some instances,
such as choosing whether to eat Chinese or Indian food for dinner, the
im portance of making the correct decision is minor. For many other de
cisions, however, the implications of choosing an imprudent course of
action are pot entially grave. As Robert Crawford notes, there are
"issues of unsurpassed importance in the daily lives of millions upon
millions of people\...being decided to a considerable extent by the
power of pub lic speaking" (2003). Although the days of the Cold War are
over, and the risk that "the next Pearl Harbor could be 'compounded by
hydrogen'" (Ehninger and Brockriede, 1978, p. 3) is greatly reduced,
**[the manipulation of public support before the invasion of Iraq in
2003 points to the continuing necessity of training a well-in formed and
critically-aware public]{.underline}** (Zarefsky, 2007). **[In the
absence of debate-trained critical thinking, ignorant but ambitious
politicians and persuasive but nefarious leaders would be much more
likely to draw the country, and possibly the world, in to conflicts with
incalculable losses in terms of human 8 well-being. Given the myriad
threats of global proportions th at will require incisive solutions,
including global warming, the spread of pandemic diseases, and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cultivating a robust and
effective society of critical decision-makers is
essential.]{.underline}** As Louis Rene Beres writes, "with such
learning, we Americans could prepare\...not as immobilized objects of
false contentment, but as authentic citizens of an endangered planet"
(2003 ). Thus, it is not surprising that critical thinking has been
called "the highest edu cational goal of the ac tivity" (Parcher, 1998).
**[While arguing from conviction can foster limited critical thinking
skills, the element of switching sides is necessary to sharpen debate's
critical edge and ensure that decisions are made in a reasoned manner
instead of being driven by ideology. Debaters trained in SSD are more
likely to evaluate both sides of an argument before arriving at a
conclusion and are less likely to dismiss potential arguments based on
his or her prior beliefs]{.underline}** (Muir 1993). In addition,
debating both sides teaches "conceptual flexibility," where
decision-makers are more likely to refl ect upon the beliefs that are
held before coming to a final opinion (Muir, 1993, p. 290) . Exposed to
many arguments on each side of an issue, debaters learn that public
policy is characteri zed by extraordinary complexity that requires
careful consideration before action. **[Finally, these arguments are
confirmed by the preponderance of empirical research demonstrating a
link between competitive SSD and critical thinking]{.underline}**
(Allen, Berkow itz, Hunt and Louden, 1999; Colbert, 2002, p. 82). The
theory and practice of SSD has value beyond the limited realm of
competitive debate as well. For the practitioners a nd students of
rhetoric, understanding how individuals come to form opini ons about
subjects and then a ttempt to persuade others is 9 of utmost importance.
Although the field of communication has established models that attempt
to explain human decision-making, such as the Rational Argumentation
Theory and others (Cragen and Shields, 1998, p. 66) , the practice of
SSD within competitive debate rounds is a real-world laboratory wh ere
argumentative experiments are carried out thousands of times over during
the course of a single year-long season. **[The theory of SSD has
profound implications for those who study how individuals are persuaded,
as well as how advocates should go about the process of forming their
own personal beliefs and attempting to persuade others.]{.underline}**

### Reasonability/Competing Interps 

#### Use reasonability it ensures access to the 1AC and prevents teams from arbitrarily going for T to exclude Affs solidly grounded in lit. 

**Ryan '4**

(Andrew B. Ryan, college debater, Wake Forest University, 2004, Reviving
Reasonability. The Debaters' Research Guide, 2004.
groups.wfu.edu/debate)

How should the affirmative initiate a discussion about the quality of
debate? **[First]{.underline}**, start by defending your own ground.
**[The resolution gives both teams a reasonable expectation of what is
topical and affirmatives choose their plan accordingly. The affirmative
has a qualified right to their reasonable expectation of the
topic]{.underline}**: how can affirmatives choose plans if they cannot
rely on definitions they have researched that support its topicality?
This right isn't unlimited, however, because the negative is encouraged
to debate the affirmative on whether their interpretation of words is
supported by grammar, common usage, field context, etc. **[But, the
negative's right to re-interpret the topic should be limited to
consistent and predictable interpretations. Resorting to arbitrary
interpretations based on illogical catchphrases unfairly allows the
negative to pull the rug out from under the affirmative.
Second]{.underline}**, affirmatives should talk about what makes a good
definition. Are dictionary definitions best? Possibly, as long as you
are not dealing with a term of art, such as peacekeeping. What about
field context? Shouldn't a definition of peacekeeping by the head of
U.N. Peacekeeping Operations be given more weight than a dictionary
definition? Lastly, **[defining a word in a certain way may be the only
way to maintain the grammatical integrity of the resolution. Take the
discussion of definitions to another level: move past superficial
quantitative discussions of limits and speak directly to the educational
benefits and disadvantages of each side's definition.]{.underline}**
**[Third]{.underline}**, don't be afraid to talk about debate's purpose.
It is a competitive game, but one that should always be based on reason
and logic. **[If what a team does enables illogical arguments to
determine the outcome of the debate, then regardless of what unlimited
topic the affirmative may allow, it is still better to vote affirmative
than eschew reason.]{.underline}** **[Reasonability is important because
strict adherence to comparing competing interpretations based on
offense/defense types of theories allows the negative to the make the
perfect the enemy of the good.]{.underline}** **[Fourth]{.underline}**,
a reasonability paradigm would help affirmatives to redefine the role of
the judge. **[One of the central negative objections to reasonability
interpretations is that they encourage judge intervention because the
judge is left without a coherent standard to determine which
interpretations are best. Affirmatives can flip this
argument]{.underline}** on the negative, however, by arguing that the
offense/defense and competing interpretations paradigm exceeds the
jurisdictional role of the judge. Traditionally, negatives argued that
jurisdiction was a voting issue because judges could not vote to endorse
a non-topical affirmative. **[The neg]{.underline}**ative age **[calls
for a judge to act as an arbiter of competing interpretations. That
exceeds the role of the judge, however, because the negative is no
longer demonstrating the affirmative is non-topical; rather they are
only demonstrating that an interpretation that excludes the affirmative
is comparatively better for debate.]{.underline}** Topicality is a
gateway issue which is meant to ensure that both sides have adequate
ground for debate: if both interpretations provide similar quantity and
quality of ground, then judges should dispense with topicality and allow
the policy debate to begin.

#### Reject the argument, not the team 

**Solt '2**

(Roger E. Solt, Debate Coach at the University of Kentucky, "Theory as a
Voting Issue: The Crime of Punishment", 2002 - Mental Health Policies:
Escape from Bedlam?, 2002, http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/

DRGArticles/DRGArtiarticlesIndex.htm)

**[First, the attempt to achieve favorable time tradeoffs is a
ubiquitous practice in current debate.]{.underline}** It is behind the
practice of making multiple answers to a given argument. It strongly
influences the number of positions the negative team will advance in the
1NC. It is behind the decision to start all of the major negative
positions in the 1NC. It dictates how many positions will be extended
through the block. It generally controls the decision about whether or
not the affirmative should "straight turn" one or more disadvantages.
Even **[the employment of punishment arguments is generally based on the
desire to secure a favorable time exchange. It seems silly to single out
a few particular instances of this universal practices and say that they
are voting issues, when the whole of debate is saturated with strategic
time considerations. Second, forcing teams to make strategic choices
does have educational value. Debaters are forced to judge which their
best arguments are and be selective about what they will extend.
Third,]{.underline}** punishment arguments constitute a self-inflicted
coverage injury. **[It takes time,]{.underline}** sometimes considerable
time, **[to argue that a certain approach has distorted your time
allocation. If debaters didn't defend punishment, they would have more
time to answer other arguments. Fourth, time skews are often minimal. It
is quite common for an issue which occupied literally seconds of the
debate to still be tagged as a voting issue.]{.underline}** In cases
like this, **[the]{.underline}** overall **[integrity of the round
would]{.underline}** certainly **[be maximized by simply rejecting the
particular argument rather than the team]{.underline}** that made it.
**[Fifth, teams defending a problematic theory]{.underline}** almost
**[always invest]{.underline}** some **[time in advancing that
position]{.underline}** and in extending it. **[Time spent answering the
time skew argument serves to redress the injury. Sixth, there are other
means of redress rather than the ballot.]{.underline}** If some other
issue was radically undercovered due to the alleged time skew**[, the
judge could allow new answers on that issue.]{.underline}** Finally,
**[seventh, time skew arguments directed against the affirmative seem
especially dubious. The structure of the debate places particular time
pressures on the affirmative. The luxury of the negative block should
give the negative ample time to answer pretty much whatever the 2AC
says.]{.underline}** (New 1AR answers do pose a different and more
legitimate concern from the standpoint of time allocation issues.)

The **[first]{.underline}** main argument I would make against
**[punishment]{.underline}** is that it **[exaggerates
theory.]{.underline}** One view of debate is that it is just a game and
that theory is as worthwhile to debate as anything else. In contrast is
the view that I would defend: that **[debate has]{.underline}** a
s**[ubstantive intellectual content which it is far more worthwhile to
learn about than it is to learn about debate theory.]{.underline}**
Debate teaches us a great deal about current events and principles of
policy analysis, about political theory, political philosophy, and
practical politics, about medicine and law, ethics and epistemology. It
teaches both problem solving and the criticism of underlying
assumptions. And it teaches many other things as well. People disagree
about which of these areas of inquiry is most important, but any and all
of these subjects are of more intrinsic significance than debate theory.
I write this as someone who finds debate theory interesting. Nor do I
think that we can get along without debate theory. Nor should we. Theory
is basically a set of meta-arguments, arguments about arguments and
about the standards for argument. We could set these standards by
authoritative edict (a rulebook) or by convention. But on many theory
questions there is widespread disagreement and hence no dominant
convention. And in the absence of a prevailing convention there is
unlikely to be an authoritative rulebook which could be adopted or
accepted. We have come, over the past quarter of a century, to think
that these are things which debaters can and should argue about. And I
accept this general outlook. But even if we neither want to nor can
entirely avoid theory argument, it should not be a central focus of the
activity. Yet this is precisely what punishment argument make it. Rather
than the criteria for the evaluation of arguments, theories come to be
ends in themselves, the pivotal issues on which the debate centrally
turns. This seems misguided. **[The knowledge gained in debate has many
uses in later life, but surely the least useful body of knowledge which
debate teaches is debate theory.]{.underline}** For those of us who stay
in the activity for a long time, it is interesting. We want to sort out
in a consistent and satisfying way the principles of our activity. But
that still does not make it a very intrinsically important body of
knowledge. I think that we sometimes confuse debate theory with argument
theory. I am not arguing that argumentation is not a valid and useful
field of thought. And argument theory may intersect with what we
commonly think of as "debate theory" at a variety of points. But the
vast bulk of debate theory, as argued in competitive debate rounds,
really just involves what are appropriate conventions for this
particular activity---a contest, sponsored by educational institutions,
with a certain format and certain conventions. Are conditional
counterplans legitimate? Are plan inclusive counterplans legitimate? Are
international counterplans legitimate? Should we assume that the "fiat"
of the affirmative plan comes immediately or only after a normal
implementation process? Must the affirmative specify an agent? These are
the staples of debate theory argument. Especially they are the kinds of
issues which most invoke punishment claims. And none of them has
particular salience outside the framework and format of contest debate.
Of course, it is possible to relate some of these arguments to
intellectual controversies beyond competitive debate. For example, a
focus on international institutions distinguishes liberalism from
realism as foreign policy paradigms. But the debate over international
fiat does not draw very heavily on this paradigmatic controversy. And
our arguments within competitive debate over the propriety of
international fiat does next to nothing to illuminate the
liberalism/realism debate within international relations. Arguments over
debate theory are reminiscent of the debates of the medieval scholastic
philosophers. Rather than arguing about how many angels can dance on the
head of pin, we argue about how many intrinsicness arguments can dance
on the head of a conditional counterplan. To Aquinas and company, the
relationship of pins and angels was interesting and meaningful.
Questions of fiat and conditionality matter to us. But only within the
narrower confines of the academic debate activity. Once you leave
debate, these issues won't matter to you. So if the focus on punishment
serves to make these kinds of arguments more central and other, more
exportable forms of knowledge more marginal, then punishment does an
intellectual disservice to the students debate is intended to teach. My
**[second]{.underline}** main argument is that, **[empirically,
punishment arguments]{.underline}** **[produce bad, anti-educational
debate.]{.underline}** Punishment arguments are almost always made
badly. **[They are simply tag lines, especially at the impact
level.]{.underline}** ("This is a voting issue for reasons of fairness
and education.") There are two dominant incentives for labeling an
objection to a given theory or practice a voting issue. The first is the
"cheap shot" motive. The "independent voter" may get lost in the
shuffle, and you may come out with an easy win. I doubt that anyone
really thinks that this process of learning to "out tech" your opponent
is an important part of debate's educational mission. Second, by
labeling an argument a voting issue, debaters hope of secure a favorable
time tradeoff. If an argument is a voting issue, it has to be taken more
seriously, even if it is not intrinsically of much substantive
importance. Again, in this instance, **[the punishment argument serves
as an element in the tactics of time tradeoff.]{.underline}** This is
part of the debate game, but it is not a very important part of what
debate should teach. As extended, punishment arguments again tend to be
a series of tag lines. This is generally true in the negative block, and
it is almost always true (because of intense time pressures) in the 1AR
and 2NR. If the 2AR chooses to go for a punishment argument, s/he may be
more articulate and explanatory. But this generally means that a lot of
new arguments are being made, or at least being given flesh from the
bare skeleton of assertion, and this raises fairness concerns of its
own. Of course, some theory debates are better than others. And I can
imagine a world in which theory is debated more clearly and coherently
than it generally is in the world of contemporary debate. But the
experience of a quarter century of theory debates does not encourage me
to think that we will enter that Promised Land any time soon. And
**["better" theory debates would have to occur in a more thorough and
time-consuming fashion than those which occur today.]{.underline}** And
this would exaggerate the problem of diverting time from more
substantive intellectual concerns. My **[third]{.underline}** argument
is that the punishment of **[voting on theory is]{.underline}** almost
always **[disproportionate.]{.underline}** To me this seems almost true
by definition. **[Someone advances a "bad" argument. They lose that
argument.]{.underline}** It is not a decisive argument in terms of the
substantive logic of the debate, be that a policy logic, a discursive
logic, or a critical logic. But **[instead of just losing that argument,
with whatever logical, limited impact that may have in the round, the
team which advanced the "bad" argument suddenly is supposed to lose the
whole debate.]{.underline}** In other words, **[every other issue in the
round]{.underline}**, all of the policy arguments, all of the critical
arguments, all of the discursive arguments become moot. They **[no
longer matter and they need not be resolved because one theory argument
has been lost. Beyond my intuitive sense that this is disproportionate,
I have two other arguments for why voting on theory is excessive. First,
the theories debaters most want to punish are not really that
egregious.]{.underline}** Punishment claims are most commonly raised
against the following practices: conditional counterplans, partially
plan inclusive counterplans, permutations against kritiks, extra-topical
plan planks, non-specification of agent by the affirmative, and a range
of affirmative and negative fiat issues. I personally favor some of
these positions, and I oppose others. But I recognize that there are
"pretty good" arguments in favor of both sides with regard to all of
these issues. In other words, they are all, relatively speaking, "close
calls." Or, to put it still another way, there are thoughtful members of
the competitive debate activity for whom each of these practices makes
sense and others for which they do not. **[On none of these issues is
there a theoretical consensus.]{.underline}** And all have been widely
employed without "destroying debate." This is not to say that these
practices are not fair game for argument. They are**[. But none is so
abusive within the context and conventions of debate as we know it that
it needs to be an automatic voting issue.]{.underline}** Losing the
argument ought to be punishment enough. Nor do we need punishment to
deal with theories which the consensus of the activity rejects. The
difficulty of winning on counterwarrants or alternative justifications
or plan/plan has easily been enough to discourage these practices.
**[Second, the debate over a given theory issue is]{.underline}**, by
the end of the round, generally **[close.]{.underline}** Each team has
its list of brief, blippy reasons to prefer one theory stance or
another. Typically, the two lists are opposed to each other, via a
process of grouping, and without clear, on-point clash. Usually both
sides drop one or more arguments made by their opponents. So again,
typically speaking, judges can almost always find grounds to resolve a
given theory debate either way, and they generally do so based on their
own biases. In this situation, it once again seems to be enough that one
side is penalized by losing the particular theory position. **[A slight
edge to one team over the other shouldn't translate into the critical
issue in the round]{.underline}**. This is especially true when, as is
often the case, the particular theory issue at stake has occupied a
fairly small percentage of the total time which the debate occupied. My
**[fourth]{.underline}** major argument against **[punishment
is]{.underline}** that it is **[intolerant. All judges have biases which
they are only partially successful at screening out. And perhaps oddly,
judges often seem less able to set aside their theory biases than their
biases on substantive issues.]{.underline}** As I noted above, judges
can generally justify voting either way on a given theory argument in
most rounds. At least if both sides are putting up a decent fight, this
is the case. If a position is conceded, most judges will behave
accordingly, though even here there are exceptions. And sometimes there
will be such a clear preponderance of argument that judges are unable to
find their way back to their own theory predispositions. But with two
reasonably skilled teams, it is generally possible to resolve a given
theory issue either way, so most judges, most of the time, end up
endorsing the theory position which they prefer. This may be an
unfortunate fact about judges, and it certainly applies to some judges
more than to others, but it is a real tendency. It is hardly
controversial to say that judges have biases. But the problem with
punishment, in light of this fact, is that voting on theory empowers
those biases. Instead of creating a strategic slant, the bias becomes
all-decisive. What we should recognize, I think, is that different
people can and do legitimately hold different concepts of what debate
should be about. If one side appeals to our theory preferences and the
other side does not, it is not unreasonable to expect that the side
whose views we embrace will win the debate over a particular issue more
often. But **[it is intolerant to rule the other side completely out of
order, to decide the whole debate based on this one issue, just because
they have gotten on the wrong side of one of our theoretical
predispositions.]{.underline}** A **[fifth]{.underline}** problem with
punishment **[is]{.underline}** its **[arbitrariness.]{.underline}**
Punishment aims at abusive practices. But **[abuse clearly falls on a
continuum. And the line at which sufficient abuse exists to justify a
ballot is inevitably arbitrary.]{.underline}** Is a ten second time
distortion enough to vote on? A ten-minute time distortion? Or where in
between? This situation is further complicated by the fact that one
never knows just how the team invoking punishment would have allocated
its time absent the problematic practice. Claims that they had wonderful
arguments which time constraints prevented them from running should be
viewed with a good deal of skepticism. Sometimes arbitrary lines must be
drawn. But especially when debate's equivalent of the death penalty is
involved, that arbitrariness should occasion concern. My
**[final]{.underline}** argument is that punishment snowballs**[. Once
the punishment paradigm is embraced, a likely consequence
is]{.underline}** what Ross Smith has called **["voting issue
proliferation."]{.underline}** Anything can be labeled as a voting
issue. And, indeed, the use of **[theory]{.underline}** as a voting
issue **[has helped]{.underline}** to **[create a class]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** debate **["cheap shot artists"]{.underline}** who
systematically employ punishment strategies. Losing on cheap shots is
infuriating for debaters and coaches, and it is frustrating for many
judges to vote on them. **[They certainly don't make debate a more
educational activity. And the teams and debaters who rely on them the
most are probably the biggest losers in educational
terms.]{.underline}**

#### Competing interpretations is key to deterring future abuse and rectify in round unfairness. 

**Solt '2**

(Roger E. Solt, Debate Coach at the University of Kentucky, "Theory as a
Voting Issue: The Crime of Punishment", 2002 - Mental Health Policies:
Escape from Bedlam?, 2002, http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/

DRGArticles/DRGArtiarticlesIndex.htm)

In Sigel 1, there are four major arguments presented in favor of
punishment. The **[first]{.underline}** argument was fairness.
**[Certain theories and practices were said to be unfair to opposing
debaters.]{.underline}** And **[it is not enough just to reject these
practices; they may so skew the round that only voting against the team
which employed them can redress competitive equity.]{.underline}** The
**[second]{.underline}** argument was education. Sigel invoked the view
that **[the judge should serve as an educator. Part of his or her role
as an educator is to discourage bad arguments. Unfair theories and
tactics may also serve to undercut the educational quality of the debate
experience.]{.underline}** The **[third]{.underline}** argument was
deterrence. **[Losing debates,]{.underline}** Sigel argued, **[is a
powerful inducement for people to change their ways.
Debaters]{.underline}** are, for the most part, rational animals, and
they **[will respond to strong competitive incentives.]{.underline}**
Sigel's **[fourth]{.underline}** rationale for punishment was argument
responsibility. **[Punishment with the ballot makes debaters highly
responsible for their arguments.]{.underline}** And
**[debate]{.underline}**, he claimed, **[should teach debaters to argue
responsibly.]{.underline}**

#### **Reasonability collapses into competing interpretations, if we win our interp creates a better topic than theirs should be considered unreasonable.** 

**Mancuso '82**

(Steve Manusco, Debater for University of Kentucky, Wake Forest
University, 1982, Topicality: In Search of Reason. The Debaters'
Research Guide, groups.wfu.edu/debate)

**[In recognition of the many possible definitions of a word, the debate
community has adopted]{.underline}** (original mother and father
unknown) **[the convention that the affirmative definition only needs to
be \"reasonable.\"]{.underline}** This burden traditionally stands
opposed to the notion that the affirmative must have the best definition
of a word, or even necessarily a better definition than the negative.
While the initial theoretical underpinnings for such a convention are
far from clear, it must certainly he justified on the grounds that it
promotes the objective of quality debating. Such a convention recognizes
that a definition is not right or wrong, but merely acceptable or
unacceptable in a given situation. In situations where broad
interpretations of a topic are desirable, a broader-than usual
definition may be reasonable, and where a narrow interpretation is
desirable, narrow definitions may be reasonable. **[Such a simplified
view of reasonability is not justified in the face of the recent uses
and abuses of such a convention. The relevant question is: What does it
mean to be reasonable?]{.underline}** Again, courts and legislators may
have their own definitions of \"reasonable,\" but they may not be at all
useful for the functioning of the term in debate. To state that a court
has been unable to define the word \"reasonable\" only means that in
that particular context it was difficult, not that such a finding should
be accepted as proof that we cannot come up with a workable concept of
reasonability for our purposes. Of course, someone who has listened to a
few debates concerning \"reasonability\" may find great sympathy with
such a court the concept has taken on very diverse forms, to say the
least, in its varied uses. On one extreme, teams have argued that as
long as they were not \"absurd\" in defining their terms, they were
reasonable, and some teams have argued that because their definition
*exists* they are some how reasonable. On the other end of the
definitional continuum, some interpretations of reasonability have been
very restrictive. Some teams have argued that only the best definition
is reasonable\--that it shows little reason to accept an inferior
definition. Clearly there has been quite a bit of disagreement as to
what is entailed by a \"reasonable\" definition. Some debate critics
have responded to this dispute by throwing up their arms and calling for
the abandonment of the concept of reasonability as a topicality
convention altogether. While it is very easy to respect and have empathy
with such sentiment, it seems prudent to attempt a less radical solution
by constructing a more useful and practical convention of reasonability
without \"\"piffing\" the concept in its entirety. I would suggest two
steps in construction of a workable reasonability convention. First, we
must agree upon what makes a definition acceptable. **[Keeping in mind
the goal of high quality debating, two criteria necessary for an
acceptable definition should be (1) Does it tend toward focusing debates
on timely and relevant policy advocacy? and (2) does it allow the
negative sufficient ability to be prepared in both analysis and
research? A definition which failed to meet either of these goals would
not seem to he an acceptable approach to interpretation.]{.underline}**
Secondly, the actual debate over topicality should center on the
question of whether or not the affirmative interpretation actually did
meet both of these criteria. In this sense, **[the \"threshold\" for
when a definition became \"reasonable\" would be raised well above the
currently less rigorous approaches, yet not overly restrict the
affirmative initial and presumptive right to define its terms. The
burden would be on the affirmative to explain, wren challenged, the
implications of its definition, thus reviving the concept of an
affirmative burden on topicality, without making the burden
prohibitively heavy by making them refute any conceivable negative
alternative definition. In an effort to supplement the convention of
\"reasonability,\" \"standards\" of definition have been offered which
the affirmative should meet in order to be considered reasonable. These
standards could potentially be used to discern whether or not the
affirmative approach met the above two criteria.]{.underline}**

### Depth/Breadth/Limits 

#### Depth outweighs breadth. 

**Tai et al '8**

Tai et al 08 \[(Robert) Curriculum, Instruction, and Special Education
Department, Curry School of Education) "Depth Versus Breadth: How
Content Coverage in High School Science Courses Relates to Later Success
in College Science Course work" 2008\]

**[The]{.underline}** baseline **[model reveals]{.underline}** a direct
and compelling outcome: **[teaching for depth is associated with
improvements in later performance.]{.underline}** Of course, there is
much to consider in evaluating the implications of such an analysis.
There are a number of questions about this simple conclusion that
naturally emerge. For example, ho w much depth works best? What is the
optimal manner to operationalize the impact of depth-based learning? Do
specific contexts (such as type of student, teacher, or school) moderate
the impact of depth? The answers to these questions certainly suggest
that a more nuanced view should be sought. Nonetheless, this analysis
appears to indicate that a robust positive association exists between
high school science teaching that pro v ides depth in at least one topic
and better performances in introductory postsecondary science courses.
**[Our results]{.underline}** also **[clearly suggest that breadth-based
learning]{.underline}**, as commonly applied in high school classrooms,
**[does not appear to offer students any advantage when they enroll in
introductory college]{.underline}** science **[courses]{.underline}**,
although it may contribute to higher scores on standardized tests.
However, the intuitive appeal of broadly surveying a discipline in an
introductory high school course cannot be overlooked. There might be
benefits to such a pedagogy that become apparent when using measures
that we did not explore. The results regarding breadth were less
compelling because in only one of the three disciplines were the results
significant in our full model. On the other hand, we observed no
positive effects at all. As it stands, **[our findings]{.underline}** at
least **[suggest that aiming for breadth in content coverage should be
avoided]{.underline}**, as we found no evidence to support such an
approach.

#### Limits are k2 clash and in depth discussion.

**Hardy 10**

(Aaron T. Hardy, Coach at Whitman College, "CONDITIONALITY, CHEATING
COUNTERPLANS, AND CRITIQUES: TOPIC CONSTRUCTION AND THE RISE OF THE
"NEGATIVE CASE"", Contemporary Argumentation & Debate, 2010, pg. 44-45,
[http://www.cedadebate.org/cad/index.php/CAD/article/view
File/271/243](http://www.cedadebate.org/cad/index.php/CAD/article/view%20File/271/243))

First, **[narrow topics]{.underline}** are more likely to [**encourage
substantive clash.** One of the primary motivations for negative teams
running away from engagement with the specifics of the affirmative is
fear of "falling behind" in the necessary research effort. On a topic
with 200 topical affirmative plan mechanisms, it is extremely unlikely
that all but the most precocious of negative teams will be prepared to
debate each one, and much more likely that they will turn instead to as
generic of an approach as possible.]{.underline} Despite sentiments from
some corners that the topic writing process is already too narrow and
specialized, I would submit that the debate community has not yet truly
experimented with what a radically narrower topic might entail. Even the
smallest topics in recent memory have afforded the affirmative an
incredible amount of flexibility, usually as a compromise to the "broad
topics good" camp. A quick perusal of any of the archived case lists
from the past decade reveals that even the narrowest topics the
community has debated have entailed dozens (if not hundreds) of discrete
affirmatives. Instead, [envision as a potentially hyperbolic example, a
topic with truly only to prepare a truly in-depth take on each one.
Chosen in concert with the right literature base, perhaps the word
"stale" could be replaced with "nuanced," even if debates superficially
resemble each other as the year progresses.]{.underline}

#### Limits means your case needs to be predictable

**Kupferberg '87**

Eric Kupferbreg, University of Kentucky 1987 "Limits - The Essence of
Topicality"

<http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Kupferberg1987LatAmer.htm>

If one considers **[the purpose of topicality\--to initiate a meaningful
discussion with sufficient prior notice and adequate ground for both
sides]{.underline}**\--then the questions of delimitation become the
focus of topicality standards. Both \'reasonability\' and \'best
definition\' claim to enhance the debate process\--the former by
providing adequate ground for affirmative case areas and the latter by
preventing an unreasonable run-a-way topic.¶ **[I am not suggesting that
limits should be the only test for topicality]{.underline}**. If this
were sole criteria, teams could argue that inherently limited topics are
superior, hence, negatives win because their definition excludes the
affirmative (there\'s always a competitive incentive to limit the
affirmative out of the round). Obviously, limits for limits sake is
arbitrary as well as abusive**[.]{.underline}** **[However, debatable
limits are clearly desirable. What are]{.underline}** these
**[\'debatable limits\'?]{.underline}** Here are some relevant questions
that if answered carefully might help to create criteria for debatable
limits:¶ 1) Are there fair number of cases that would be topical? An
interpretation that overlimited the resolution would be as inappropriate
as one which unlimited the topic. **[An entire year of debating a single
case or 300 cases would be neither educational or enjoyable. An
interpretation that allowed somewhere between 20 and 40 cases might be
acceptable to most participants in the activity.¶]{.underline}** 2) Is
the interpretation open to innovation? Part of the intrigue of debating
the same topic year round is the competitive incentive for affirmatives
to seek new slants. **[A debatable interpretation should allow for new
cases\--although they would be chosen from a predictable range of
areas]{.underline}**. A debatable limit should not force an overly
static topic.¶ 3) Does the interpretation fit within some scope of the
field context? While not suggesting that we should rely on field
contextual definitions alone, **[an interpretation of the topic should
bear some resemblance to the topic area.]{.underline}** It would be
almost axiomatic to suggest that a definition of \'agricultural\' last
year should lend itself to cases that are relevant to real world
agricultural issues.¶ 4) Does the interpretation allow for some degree
of prior notice? **[A debatable limit is one where a large number of
topical cases are to be anticipated by the general debate
community.]{.underline}** This is not to imply that surprise
\'squirrels\' should be prohibited, only that definitions should
encompass what a large portion of the debate circuit is running.

#### Limits destroy creative thinking -- innovation results from breaking rules and challenging dominate modes of thought. 

**Clark 07**

\[(Brian, CEO and founder of Coppyblogger Media) "Do You Recognize These
10 Mental Blocks to Creative Thinking?", Coppyblogger, 9/18/07\]

Whether you're trying to solve a tough problem, start a business, get
attention for that business or write an interesting article, **[creative
thinking]{.underline}** is crucial. The process **[boils down to
changing your perspective and seeing things differently than you
currently do. People like to call this "thinking outside of the
box,"]{.underline}** which is the wrong way to look at it. Just like Neo
needed to understand that "[there is no
spoon](http://www.donnarose.com/Spoon.html)" in the film *The Matrix*,
you need to realize **["there is no box" to step outside
of.]{.underline}** You create your own imaginary boxes simply by living
life and accepting certain things as "real" when they are just as
illusory as the beliefs of a paranoid delusional. The difference is,
enough people agree that certain man-made concepts are "real," so you're
viewed as "normal." This is good for society overall, but it's that sort
of unquestioning consensus that inhibits your natural creative
abilities. So, rather than looking for ways to *inspire* creativity, you
should just realize the truth. You're already capable of creative
thinking at all times, but you have to strip away the imaginary mental
blocks (or boxes) that you've picked up along the way to wherever you
are today. I like to keep this list of 10 common ways we suppress our
natural creative abilities nearby when I get stuck. It helps me realize
that the barriers to a good idea are truly all in my head. 1. Trying to
Find the "Right" Answer **[One of the worst aspects of formal education
is the focus on the correct answer to a particular question or
problem.]{.underline}** While **[this approach]{.underline}** helps us
function in society, it **[hurts creative thinking because real-life
issues are ambiguous. There's often more than one "correct" answer, and
the second one you come up with might be better than the
first.]{.underline}** Many of the following mental blocks can be turned
around to reveal ways to find more than one answer to any given problem.
**[Try reframing the issue in several different ways in order to prompt
different answers, and embrace answering inherently ambiguous questions
in several different ways.]{.underline}** 2. Logical Thinking Not only
is real life ambiguous, it's often illogical to the point of madness.
While **[critical thinking skills based on logic are]{.underline}** one
of our main strengths in evaluating the feasibility of a creative idea,
it's **[often the enemy of truly innovative thoughts in the first place.
One of the best ways to escape the constraints of your own logical mind
is to think
[metaphorically](http://www.copyblogger.com/become-a-master-of-metaphor-and-multiply-your-blogging-effectiveness/).]{.underline}**
One of the reasons why metaphors work so well in communications is that
we accept them as true without thinking about it. **[When you realize
that "truth" is often symbolic, you'll often find that you are actually
free to come up with alternatives.]{.underline}** 3. Following Rules One
way to **[view creative thinking is]{.underline}** to look at it as **[a
destructive force. You're tearing away the often arbitrary rules that
others have set for you]{.underline}**, and asking either "why" or "why
not" whenever confronted with the way "everyone" does things. This is
easier said than done, since **[people will often defend the rules they
follow even in the face of evidence that the rule doesn't
work.]{.underline}** People love to celebrate rebels like Richard
Branson, but few seem brave enough to emulate him. Quit worshipping rule
breakers and **[start breaking some rules.]{.underline}** 4. Being
Practical Like logic, **[practicality is hugely important when it comes
to execution, but often stifles innovative ideas before they can
properly blossom.]{.underline}** Don't allow [the
editor](http://www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-curse/) into the same
room with your inner artist. **[Try not to evaluate the actual
feasibility of an approach until you've allowed it to exist on its own
for a bit.]{.underline}** Spend time asking "what if" as often as
possible, and simply allow your imagination to go where it wants. You
might just find yourself discovering a crazy idea that's so insanely
practical that no one's thought of it before. 5. Play is Not Work
Allowing your mind to be at play is perhaps the most effective way to
stimulate creative thinking, and yet many people disassociate play from
work. These days, the people who can come up with great ideas and
solutions are the most economically rewarded, while worker bees are
often employed for the benefit of the creative thinkers. You've heard
the expression "work hard and play hard." All you have to realize is
that they're the same thing to a creative thinker. 6. That's Not My Job
**[In an era of hyper-specialization, it's those who happily explore
completely unrelated areas of life and knowledge who best see that
everything is related.]{.underline}** This goes back to what ad man
[Carl
Ally](http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-remarkably-creative-content/)
said about creative persons---they want to be *know-it-alls*. Sure,
you've got to know the specialized stuff in your field, but if you
**[view yourself as an explorer rather than a highly-specialized cog in
the machine]{.underline}**, you'll run circles around the technical
master in the success department. 7. Being a "Serious" Person Most of
what keeps us civilized boils down to conformity, consistency, shared
values, and yes, thinking about things the same way everyone else does.
There's nothing wrong with that necessarily, but if you can mentally
accept that it's actually nothing more than groupthink that helps a
society function, you can then give yourself permission to turn
everything that's accepted upside down and shake out the illusions.
Leaders from Egyptian pharaohs to Chinese emperors and European royalty
have consulted with *fools*, or court jesters, when faced with tough
problems. The persona of the fool allowed the truth to be told, without
the usual ramifications that might come with speaking blasphemy or
challenging ingrained social conventions. Give yourself permission to be
a fool and see things for what they really are. 8. Avoiding Ambiguity We
rationally realize that most every situation is ambiguous to some
degree. And although dividing complex situations into black and white
boxes can lead to disaster, we still do it. **[It's an innate
characteristic of human psychology to desire certainty, but it's the
creative thinker who rejects the false comfort of clarity when it's not
really appropriate.]{.underline}** **[Ambiguity is your friend if you're
looking to innovate.]{.underline}** The fact that most people are
uncomfortable exploring uncertainty gives you an advantage, as long as
you can embrace ambiguity rather than run from it.
