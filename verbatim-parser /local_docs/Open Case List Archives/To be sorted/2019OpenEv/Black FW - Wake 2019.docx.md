#### Our framework argument is not a procedural question, it is a political question designed to think about the future development of radical debate practice. Our interpretation is that the affirmatives radical aesthetic must be paired with the affirmation of a specific plan or policy change. 

**Radical resistance must be paired with demands for institutional
change or we risk wasting the timeliness of our current moment -- Trump
has galvanized the left, but we can't lose momentum.**

The events in Charlottesville have remained in the headlines for the
last few weeks for a variety of reasons. Surprise at the audacity of a
torch-light procession of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, and
"alt-rightists" in an American city, coupled with the murder of social
justice activist Heather Heyer during a counterdemonstration, fueled the
initial coverage. President Trump's abhorrent response to the tragedy
and local struggles against Confederate statues kept it alive. And
frequently dimwitted debates about the merits of antifa have supplied
yet more conversational oxygen. But it would be a mistake for the
American left to see this as a decisive turning point in history, or
mistake torch-wielding fascists for a mass force. On the contrary:
getting consumed by debates about supporting antifa in its street
clashes with neo-Nazis misses the larger political landscape. [[The
post-Charlottesville moment does demand **antiracist
mobilizations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it's heartening that left
organizations have sprung into action and seen their numbers swell.
Standing up to the far right --- particularly when done effectively and
en masse, like in Boston --- can energize people who are otherwise
frustrated and disenchanted because of the Trump administration.
[[But]{.mark} that [needs]{.mark} to be linked to [tangible]{.mark}
political [organizing]{.mark} [that]{.mark} **[goes beyond the]{.mark}
[defensive]{.mark} or [symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Discussions
about antifa are also important. Interviews with counter-protestors on
the ground in Charlottesville made it clear they were more than happy
antifa was there to help. In fact, Cornel West credited them with saving
his life. But the debate over antifa cannot be at the center of left
political discussion. [[I am less concerned about]{.mark} being murdered
by [a neo-Nazi than]{.mark} I am about the **[lack of]{.mark} [access to
quality]{.mark} [health care]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I am more exercised
about the suppression of voting rights and the damage it does to
democracy in the here and now than the damage simply represented by
Confederate statues. This is not to dismiss the efforts to tear down
Confederate statutes. What lies in the public commons, after all, needs
to represent the kind of country we want the United States to be. But we
shouldn't allow the conflagration to cloud our vision. In short, the
lessons post-Charlottesville are the lessons we should have learned
earlier this year. [[We cannot simply react to Trump]{.mark} or the
"alt-right." **Being proactive**, **[advancing a]{.mark} clear
[program]{.mark}** [that can mobilize]{.mark} and galvanize a huge swath
of [the public]{.mark} --- this [must be the hallmark]{.mark} of the
American left. [Otherwise]{.mark}, the genuine **[anger]{.mark} directed
[at Trump]{.mark} and the GOP [will be wasted.]{.mark}** And we'll
**squander our chance** to build the kind of broad-based left that, in
the end, is the best bulwark against the far right]{.underline}. The
Politics We Need Most of the planks of the left platform we need are
already out there, waiting to be used to spur genuine debate and action
across American society. Two in particular should top any left agenda.
The first is universal health care: Medicare for All. The Republicans'
haphazard bid to scrap the Affordable Care Act showed that even an
extremely flawed version of "universal" coverage was still popular
enough to scuttle repeal attempts. Now, according to recent polling,
[[public support for]{.mark} **[single-payer]{.mark}** [is on the
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even centrist Democrats like Kamala Harris
are getting on board. [After **decades of struggle**, [universal health
care is]{.mark}, if not right around the corner, at least [on the near
horizon]{.mark}. Crucially, **[the demand for]{.mark} [Medicare for
All]{.mark} also [offers]{.mark} a means to build the bonds of
[solidarity]{.mark}**. As Atlantic writer Vann R. Newkirk recently
pointed out, Martin Luther King Jr and other [**civil rights activists**
saw universal health care as **a critical component** of]{.mark} their
struggle for [a just]{.mark} and equitable
[society]{.mark}.]{.underline} The same is true today. [[Across
movements]{.mark} --- [whether for **black lives**]{.mark} [or a
**fifteen-dollar minimum wage** or **immigrant rights**]{.mark} ---
[universal health care is a demand that unifies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There's another reason to prioritize the push for universal health care.
Far-right organizations like the Traditionalist Workers Party have begun
making overtures to poor whites in places like Appalachia by talking
about jobs and access to quality health care. We can't allow a pitch for
decent health care, or an argument for good jobs, to be used as a
gateway to fascism. Universal voting rights should be the second demand
of any immediate left platform. Our political and economic system can't
be changed, radically and in the long-term, through voting. But
countless people are being hurt by the system as it exists today, and
substantially boosting voter turnout is a prerequisite for winning the
reforms that will improve their lives in the short term. Conservatives
understand the importance of voting rights. In recent years, numerous
GOP-controlled states have passed laws restricting the franchise,
whether through ID requirements or shorter windows for voter
registration. They know a smaller, demoralized voting base makes it
harder to get left candidates into office. In the past, the Populist era
of the 1890s came to a crashing halt in part because of Jim Crow laws
and new state constitutions across the South that severely limited
voting rights for African Americans (and many poor whites as well). On
the flip side, the rise of a strong voting base in the urbanized North,
which included union members and African Americans, propelled the New
Deal forward and gave social democracy in America some of its earliest
and most important victories --- despite opposition from both
conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats. More recently, results
at the local level have testified to the enduring power of a mobilized
electorate. Victories by Chokwe Lumumba in Jackson, Mississippi's
mayoral race and khalid kamau in South Fulton, Georgia's city council
election were made possible by left-wing political activism on the
ground. That these victories occurred in the Deep South and with heavy
political participation from African Americans also belies common
perceptions about what the Left looks like and where it can compete.
Both Lumumba and kamau met people where they were at, while also
sketching out an expansive vision. Which brings me to another important
part of the Left's post-Charlottesville toolbox: political education.
[The debate over monuments and Confederate flags is a perfect
opportunity to get Americans [thinking]{.mark} **not just [about]{.mark}
the world we live in, but [the]{.mark} kind of [world we could live in
if the Left was given the opportunity to lead.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Beyond considering what statues to tear down, we should discuss what
statues should replace them. Why not more monuments, across the country,
to the United States Colored Troops or Harriet Tubman? But we should not
stop with statues and public history, as important as they are to
shaping future debates about the country's fate. [**[Political
education]{.mark}** [should]{.mark} reach out to a wide range of
Americans, both **[expand]{.mark}ing [their conception of what's
possible]{.mark}** and learning how they see the world]{.underline}.
Left education, after all, should be a two-way street. It can take a
variety of forms --- from setting up a booth at a community event or
organizing a teach-in at a union hall to simply making sure socialist
organizations are as open to the public as possible. Examples of
political education, as I describe it, already exist. In my adopted home
state of South Carolina, the SC Progressive Network offers a yearly
"Modjeska Simkins School" to budding activists. Named after one of the
state's greatest human rights advocates, the seminar teaches history as
well as protest and activist tactics. It, and other education efforts
like it across the nation, are the spiritual grandchildren of the
Highlander Folk School in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Finally, mass
protest against white supremacy will continue to be a crucial tactic
going forward. The rally in Boston last month, where a handful of
neo-Nazis were met with over thirty thousand counter-protesters, was an
enormous victory for progressives and the Left. It demonstrated the
power of solidarity, viscerally and publicly. But such actions must also
be tied to the sorts of political programs and tactics pitched above ---
using them as opportunities to not only bring together everyone opposed
to white supremacy, but talking to people about the ways in which class
warfare from above, gender and racial discrimination, and a revanchist
politics hurts virtually everyone every day. We can't let facile
narratives about "poor whites" drive the discourse on racism in American
society. The white supremacists that marched in defense of the Robert E.
Lee statue included many well-off, college-educated whites that would
have no qualms throwing away the lives of poor white Americans. They
would also destroy the lives and aspirations of African Americans, Jews,
Latinos, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. [By challenging these
narratives and linking them to **[concrete demands]{.mark}** for a
better future, we can [reach out to people who]{.mark} were galvanized
by Charlottesville but [might not know what can be done next]{.mark}.
Breaking White Supremacy\'s Back These recommendations aren't
politically sexy. They don't seem the stuff of revolution. But they're
the **necessary materials for [improving]{.mark} political [conditions
in the near future]{.mark} --- which [has to be done before we can work
for more transformative change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Political
education, for example, will be crucial for resuscitating the labor
movement]{.underline}, to avoid more defeats like those suffered in
union drives at Boeing's plant in Charleston, South Carolina or Nissan's
plant in Canton, Mississippi. [A strong left **expands the public
sphere**, offering a broader conception of what's politically
attainable]{.underline}. It offers people a politics not of scapegoating
or austerity but universal health care and democratic agency.
Historically, **[[it's been the most potent antidote to the far
right]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But we must also remember that victory in
street battles does not equal a durable political victory. Nor, on the
other hand, is seeing a Democratic House in 2018 or a Democrat in the
White House in 2020 the final measure of victory. The problems of
Trump's America are, not surprisingly, much like the problems of Obama's
America. And Bush's America. And Clinton's America. [[An effective
left]{.mark} post-Charlottesville [will have to concern itself]{.mark},
as always, [with **long-term planning**]{.mark} and patient
organizing]{.underline}. That's the only way we'll finally break the
back of white identity politics --- the only identity politics to ever
wield real political power in America.

**Radical resistance with no long-term goal or plan will only galvanize
the alt right which has proven over the last eight years that they are
more than willing to use their votes to wield institutional power -- a
lot is at stake in this moment -- Reinvigorating Trump's base increases
the likelihood of a Republican victory in 2020 -- We need all hands on
deck, we must begin to develop coherent strategies for dealing with our
current political moment**

Many [progressives are in a]{.underline} major [defensive

decry his PR efforts on jobs, chide him for his love affair with Putin

impeach him as soon as possible for his disregard for the constitution.

#### Violation -- Neither the FMS or DCS programs control the transfer or sale of surplus military arms to state and local law enforcement agencies in the US.

#### Reasons to Vote Negative

#### [Topic Education]{.underline} -- The affirmatives focus on domestic issues crowds out research and education on topic specific countries that are facing issues with structural oppression and the militarization of the Police. The US sales arms, equipment and training to many nations, like Mexico, Honduras, Israel, etc. The aff interpretation discourages developing an analytic to frame the relationship between capital, imperialism and security that produces antiblack policing tactics.

#### And, the Aff is US Centric crowding out discussion of global anti-blackness.

#### (Global antiblackness card)

#### [Ground]{.underline} -- Aff focuses on the domestic mooting all pre-season prep on the topic and generic negative positions. We lose all link ground to US foreign policy action like Security K's and international relations disads which are at the core of the topic. We lose all topic specific K's and disad counterplan ground to excluding specific weapons from the reduction or disads to reduction for specific countries.

#### The 1AC is actually disad ground for the negative. We should be able to argue that reduction in foreign arms sales creates a surplus that the USFG sells or transfers to domestic police leading to militarized police forces that produce black death. The 1AC spikes out of the link because the aff is extra-topical and the judges should reject all advantages stemming from non-topical action.

#### The aff is unpredictable even from the left. We can't predict affs that have little to no relation to the topic. If we can not find link arguments by googling various aspects of the aff and US arms sales or at the very least US imperialism through foreign policy then the aff is unpredictable on this topic and unfairly explodes the research burden for the negative.

#### Critical Switch Side Debate is Good and key to all your offense -- Black SSD proves hard left affs can be both topical and anti the state and civil society. Conviction Based Debate (CBD) results in debates where the debaters have already decided their position in debate and the world such that we do not consider our relationship to Others. It produces insular debates that destroy education, ethics and reproduces anti-blackness 

**Evans 12** \[Rashad, JD., Black debate extraordinare and JD, "The
1NC," Nov 20, http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/\]

Now, the debate! First, let me look at Casey Harrigan's ("CH")
definition of SSD. He says that : Definition: switch side debate (SSD)
is the practice that requires debaters to argue both for and against a
given topic in alternating rounds. In effect, it has meant that
debaters' arguments are divorced from personal conviction and instead
made contingently as a means of "testing" the truth value of a
proposition. I will accept this definition, but I think it requires some
more refinement. In a practical sense, **[[SSD]{.mark}, at a minimum,
[requires that the affirmative defend the
resolution.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For the most part, the negative is
unconstrained (except by competition) and most debates in which SSD
comes up the question is whether the affirmative team should be required
to affirm the topic, including some defense of an action by the United
States Federal Government ("USFG"). **[[The essential question posed by
SSD is whether the affirmative team should be required to defend the
resolution even when they (1) fundamentally disagree with all or part of
it and/or (2) are compelled to affirm other ideas because of their
"personal convictions]{.underline}."]{.mark}** The answer to this
question must be yes. First, **[[there are multiple
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** to skin a cat and even more ways [t**[o
affirm the resolution]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the world of
parametric debate because [one need only affirm an interpretation of the
resolution and not the resolution writ large.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Therefore, **[[there are rare instances in which there is no
interpretation of the resolution that you cannot defend and these rare
instances are most likely the product of lack of creativity and
research]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So in reality, the question is an even
simpler one: should the affirmative team be required to defend an
interpretation of the resolution. There are immense constitutive and
instrumental benefits to SSD that cannot be otherwise obtained and
therefore must be required. I ask that the judges: George, Justin and
Kyla evaluate this debate holistically, which requires that they
evaluate the benefits of SSD to the speaker (constitutive) and to
society (instrumental). This also requires that they exclude nothing in
their analysis of this debate. The Constitutive **[Debaters benefit from
SSD. It requires that they engage in topics that they may not otherwise
engage.]{.underline}** The resolution poses a unique question and the
debate round is a unique time to answer that question. One is much more
likely to consider their personal convictions outside of the debate
round than they are to consider the resolution outside the debate round.
**[Therefore, independently of whether one agrees with the resolution or
not, there are benefits to [defending]{.mark} an interpretation of [the
resolution]{.mark} in that it [requires you to consider
something]{.mark} you may not have [otherwise]{.mark} considered. These
[thought expiriments create more informed and thoughtful
debaters]{.mark} and citizens.]{.underline}** **[SSD creates a unique
opportunity for self-reflexivity.]{.underline}** The idea is to let your
personal convictions guide you in the debate. **[[The resolution doesn't
require that you suppress your identity]{.mark} or convictions, but is
instead an opportunity to infuse that identity and those convictions
into the resolution and public policy discussion.]{.underline}** So,
given who you are, what you believe and what you know what say you
regarding energy production? What say you regarding democracy
assistance? What say you regarding federal control in Indian Country?
Therefore, **[[the resolution is an opportunity for you to refine your
personal convictions and put your identity in politics instead of
relying exclusively on identity politics.]{.mark} SSD allows you to
check your own privilege.]{.underline}** Here, I will rely on my
personal experience. I once participated in a 30 day creative challenge
where the challenge leader would pose questions on facebook and the
group would answer them in the comments section. One day he asked us to
imagine we could be the other gender for 3 days and to discuss what
would we do. I thought about this on the A-train from Harlem to Chelsea
and again from Chelsea to Harlem and had no answer because I couldn't
imagine being a woman. I explained that as a gay man I don't need to be
a woman to have sex with a man, I don't want a baby in me and more
importantly I don't want the physical vulnerability of being a woman.
This realization really forced me to reevaluate my previous jokes even
that as a gay many I was ontologically indistinct from a woman. I am
not. I am gay and I am black...in many ways I am the the worlds bottom,
but even I could would not want to occupy the body of a woman. That
thought experiment taught me a lot about myself, privilege and the
world. Sometimes, you have to take a walk in someone else's stiletto to
learn who you really are. Seriously CH, have you walked in stilettos? It
will change your life. **[[SSD is both necessary and sufficient to
ensure that you debate your personal convictions.]{.mark} Remember, if
you are staunchly opposed to the resolution [you get to]{.mark}
[lodge]{.mark} those [complaints on the negative.]{.mark} Also, remember
that what is good for the goose is good for the gander and [if you don't
have to debate the resolution then no one has to]{.mark} debate the
resolution. [This]{.mark} loosening of the restrictions on the
resolution may [mean that no one gets to debate anything they
want.]{.mark}]{.underline}** I mean lets face it, no one wants to be
topical! There's always a better version of your aff that isn't topical.
Every 2AC considers severance or intrinsicness because the resolution is
flawed or insufficient. However, a true debater understands that they
both have **[to debate on the affirmative and the
negative]{.underline}** and that in order to do either **[effectively
[there must be stability in the relationship between the
aff]{.mark}irmative [and]{.mark} the [neg]{.mark}ative.]{.underline}**
Therefore, committing yourself to the resolution is key preserving your
own negative ground to engage in your critique of the resolution. As
goes the resolution so goes your personal convictions about that
resolution. The Instrumental **[SSD is the only way to organize a fair
debate tournament.]{.underline}** We must have a topic. There must be
rules and allowing any and everyone go rogue because of their "personal
convictions" it is a recipe for disaster. I don't want to live and
debate in that world. **[There must be strict requirements on defending
the resolution to allow for fair and predictable negative
ground.]{.underline}** By the way, protecting **[[fair negative ground
is easier and more important than all other concerns regarding
fairness.]{.mark} All people of all convictions have to be negative at
some point. Which means that [the affirmative-negative dialiectic is the
only intersectional analysis]{.mark} that can be performed
[because]{.mark} all people of [all identities will eventually find
themselves]{.mark} on the [aff]{.mark}irmative or [neg]{.mark}ative side
in debate. Preserving negative ground then preserves the ground of
women, minorities and hippies.]{.underline}** SSD ensures that we have
all hands on deck in these extraordinary times. We need all perspectives
and all peoples to engage in all debates. SSD facilitates this.
**[Allowing students to pick their own topic because of their "[personal
convictions"]{.mark} may [mean that important issues get ignored]{.mark}
all together.]{.underline}** I mean, what would happen if we let the
students set the curriculum? Would they learn anything, ever? How many
times have you heard these questions in a classroom: why do I have to
learn this? Will this be on the exam? My major is X, why do I need to
learn Y? Blah. Yes, students would almost always like to do what they
want to do. If we allowed this where would we be as a country? Who will
be there to tackle the important questions pertaining to immigration,
energy production, the Arab Spring, etc? **[Engaging the resolution from
your specific social location can cause others to change their
views.]{.underline}** There are several examples of creative
interpretations of the resolution that have inspired folk to view the
topic and life differently. This is when debate is at its best and when
it's engaging in important knowledge production. Debate and debaters
have the potential to infuse new arguments, ideas and perspectives into
the resolution and into the broader discussion. Now, the line by line!
CH says: 1. It presumes debate as a "pedagogical bull-pen", which
undermines the activity's potential for radical change. Students are
told "you can't know anything until you debate both sides", ignoring the
VAST WEALTH of lived experience that underwrites specific claims about
identity, the world, praxis, and the topic. In some ways, it is like
Loyola's argument about info accumulation -- we are told to place a hold
on "conviction" until we have "enough information" and "enough testing"
when in reality there is either never a point where "enough is enough"
OR we have \*already\* crossed that point and should be able to utilize
the debate space for advocacy. It makes debate into a game about
hypothetical action rather than a potential site for social justice.
First, there are radically topical interpretations of the resolution.
Second, **[how does one know that their lived experience is dispositive
of any debate without testing it against the research and lived
experiences of others. It's not that you can't know anything until you
debate both sides but more importantly that you debate both sides before
you conclude you know anything. Lastly, [there is no internal link
between resolutional debate and the loss of social justice.]{.mark} In
fact, [one should always debate the resolution in a way that produces
social justice.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 2. It is anti-Black. The norm of
SSD and topic construction mandating USFG action presume that public
policy is valuable because it is equally accessible to all participants,
when in reality access is ANYTHING BUT that, relies on a belief that
USFG action is a locus for change when in reality and history it has
produced the opposite, marginalizes individual perspectives as "too
local", and does not account for the specific conditions of Black
participation in debate. Your anti-Blackness argument is without
warrant. **[[To the extent that anti-Blackness is a problem, SSD is the
solution.]{.mark} Certainly, holding on to ones conviction in avoidance
of debate has never benefited Black people in the past[. Thinking itself
is Blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}** (whiteness is anti-thought), **[[so
avoiding a debate because of personal conviction is quintessentially
anti-Black.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In fact, many of debates current ills
stem from people avoiding debates and holding fast to their convictions.
**[Also, [the USFG is not uniquely anti-Black. The world is anti-Black,
so to isolate the USFG is to]{.mark} fundamentally [misunderstand
Blackness.]{.mark} The USFG has been a locus for change where others
have failed. For instance, the civil rights act regulated the racist
behavior of private individuals and corporations.]{.underline}** School
desegregation required federal intervention to ensure state compliance
with the constitution. The Violence Against Women's Act regulates
individual behavior in the home which was once considered a private
matter. **[This is not to suggest that [the USFG]{.mark} is a saint, but
to suggest that the [question requires more nuance]{.mark} and that

##  2NC - 1033 Program: Black Framework 

###  OV

#### The nexus question of this debate is whose model of debate creates the best training ground to create strategies to combat anti-black violence. Our mode creates the best strategies and activists which spills over to create material change through strategic engagements with the political. The 1ac is a tactic, it's a one instance movement. Our model of debate proposes we need to form strategies to deal with a multi-level problem over a period, instead of saying we should have this one-time solution. Otherwise, we are never able mitigate daily forms of antiblackness.

###  FW PROPER

#### A.    Our interpretation is that the 1ac should have defended a change in the USFG Foreign Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales Policy that reduces arms sales from the US.

#### B.    Our definitions concede that only the United States Federal Government has the full control over Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial sales. Prefer these definitions are from for legal precision because they are from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency and US State Department which. This is the only way you can accurately engage with the resolution.

 

#### C.    Violation -- Neither the FMS or DCS programs control the transfer or sale of surplus military arms to state and local law enforcement agencies in the US.

** Reasons to Vote**

#### 1. Topic Education - Our instance of political analysis of arm sales initiates material engagement in how police militarization creates the conditions for subjugated black communities. In order to have vibrant left v left debates, we need to also have training on how to mitigate this particular instance of antiblackness. Functionally, their protest doesn't provide a way to transverse international arm sales, and how the United States exports anti blackness worldwide. There are 3 impacts:

#### A.    Anti blackness v imperialism: A mechanism of colonialism that the US still employs is to not inform the public about arm sales to foreign nations like Egypt, Honduras, etc. The aff perpetuates this by not educating the debate space on the topic of foreign military arm sales or DCS that have exacerbated antiblackness worldwide.

#### B.     Protesting does nothing when the US continues to portray power through this key aspect of imperialism. Our model of debate ensures we can talk about material strategies.

#### C.    Kritikal scholarship: Our model of debate ensures we can talk about material strategies. There is more than enough critical knowledge on us imperialism and arm sales that enables the aff to still access their advantages.

#### 2. Ground:

#### A. The affs advantages should be negative disad ground\-\-\--To clarify, the 1033 program functions by giving unsold military weapons to local police forces, so a common disad under our interpretation of the topic would be that cutting arms sales militarized police departments. The 1ac spikes out of this DA preventing us from reading one of the topic literatures most prominent negative arguments as well as preventing the discussion of the policy tradeoff of cutting arms sales with the militarization of the police. We think this is an incredibly important discussion to have considering understanding nuances of how arms sales and police militarization are interconnected is a pre-requisite to entering the real world and advocating for effective policy measures that can reduce violence on a local and domestic field. In there interpretation of debate since they can spike out of the 1033 DA link its possible that we never have in depth discussion of how unsold arms get in the hands of police on this topic, which creates  a terrible education precedent for us debaters because when its our turn to influence policy change we might fail to recognize like many of our current politicians how seemingly beneficial international arms policy exacerbates and intensifies militarizes domestic anti-black violence.

#### B. Ground (predictability) -- The aff is unpredictable because it is an instance of the US transferring weapons, not selling weapons to African governments without going through FMS and DCS. This justifies affs that are about any transfer the US has ever made, whether it be US "gifts" or trafficking of any individual gun. This is bad because it means that the aff explodes limits and massively increases the research burden on the negative. This means the negative is never adequately able to engage with the affirmative and each debate becomes a stale reading of generic arguments that don't link which kills topic education, and also means that every team goes 3-3 because they lose to small, shifty affs that are competitively incentivized. Vote negative to set predictable limits -- camp sets a unique precedent for the year and it is important to have fair ground.

#### C. Critical Switch Side debate - garners all your offense and is a better form of debate because we are key to activism.  Our model of debate ensures that debaters do not stick to abstract theories with no chance of externalization this means when they get out of the debate, they have no knowledge of how to challenge the political. This is bad because of presidents like Trump, who are racist, sexist, ableism, get voting into office. I'll do more work on the disad flow. 

#### Leaders A Beautiful Struggle is an example of how talking about material strategies in debate transfer to the real world. They are a group of political activists which advances the public policy interest of Black people, in Baltimore. Devon Love, one of the founders, was a policy debater who had traditional training and grounded his research in material strategies for his community. 

###  A2 USFG IS ANTIBLACK

**Cross apply the Evan 12 evidence -- The USFG is not uniquely
antiblack. Making a demand on the state is not affirming the state. The
resolution is negative state action, which means affirming is good. **

###  A2 we don't defend ontology

#### They don't have a specific mechanism to which they resolve 1033, our interp shows that you are just theorization. You don't teach people to do anything or how to act. There no internal link between the training ground your affs method creates and the creation of concrete strategies to mitigate anti-blackness. The question of this debate is not whether or not we can solve anti-blackness, we both agree the world is messed up, however the 1ac's structural analysis doesn't do anything, our model of debate creates a training ground for means of activism that can mitigate specific instances of anti-blackness. If the aff cannot describe how their model can train activism to even help one person outside this round than they should not win the ballot. All they have offered is a political theory, but the theory alone doesn't help anyone. At best the aff is an inspirational means of politics, but the negative is something that takes the affirmatives theory of power and transforms it into a means of material engagement. Our model doesn't preclude their theory of power, we just think there theorization should be coupled with action. (The aff is a practice, the neg offers a means of a praxis) The way in which we transmit the experiences of the 1ac, its those things that allow us to interfere, a way to transverse the messed-up world. Your aff does not teaching people how to engage in the world, our perspective leads you to do absolutely nothing. The aff will risk life or death for particular bodies, the neg will talk about those bodies. 

###  A2 warren

#### False hope and no hope are different. We don't hope to do anything, we know that our plan will mitigate how a specific form of anti-blackness attacks people, we don't think ab will go away. 

###  TVA 

#### TVA -- THE USFG SHOULD BAN WHITE PEOPLE FROM OWNING GUNS

**Gorovitz 18** (Jessie Gorovitz is a political science major from
Berkeley, Calif. "America's right to bear arms carries a racist double
standard" 4/5/18.
<https://kenyoncollegian.com/opinion/2018/04/americas-right-to-bear-arms-carries-a-racist-double-standard/>)
ME.

The first protest I participated in was after Officer Darren Wilson shot
and killed Michael Brown in 2014. Students from my high school organized
a walkout to protest police brutality and violence in black communities.
Over 3,000 students left school during sixth period for a rally in front
of the police station and a march. My teacher held a teach-in during the
class period that day, and I decided to attend to learn more about the
history of police brutality and racialized violence in America. That was
the first time I considered the racist history of gun violence and
ownership in our country. The event changed my approach to the issue.
When addressing gun violence, it is paramount to consider its impact
outside of school shooting[s. The [implications of gun violence
are]{.mark} particularly [severe for communities of color
because]{.mark} of [the racist history of gun violence and]{.mark} gun
[ownership]{.mark} in our country. [White people]{.mark} in America have
[created a double standard]{.mark} that has existed since the founding
of our country. This double standard **[encourage]{.mark}**s **[white
people to purchase, own and use firearms]{.mark}** publicly, **[yet
penalizes black people with death for]{.mark}** the mere possibility of
**[exercising that]{.mark}** same **[right]{.mark}**. While the Second
Amendment technically grants all Americans the right to keep and bear
arms, **the penalty black men face for the perception of owning or
carrying a gun is death.**]{.underline} Allan Ballard '52, one of the
first black students to graduate from Kenyon, wrote in his book One More
Day's Journey about the violence black communities experienced in the
North and South after the Civil War. In both regions, black communities
experienced high levels of violence and terror[. [White people used guns
to]{.mark} enforce a system of oppression that [maintain]{.mark}ed
[their power and control over black people after]{.mark} the end of
[slavery]{.mark}. In the South, this took the form of extrajudicial mob
violence. Because white people perceived black people, particularly
black men, as a threat, they used extrajudicial lynchings to enforce the
existing social hierarchy]{.underline}. Outside of the South, police
terrorized black communities, and beatings were common in the station
house and on the streets. White people continue to fight for their own
right to own guns but penalize the black community for their use of that
same right. The very definition of patriotism and gun ownership is
unequally applied to black and white communities. **[In his speech The
Ballot or the Bullet, [Malcolm X called for black people to arm
themselves if the government continued to fail]{.mark} to protect their
rights. [He was labeled a]{.mark} domestic
[terrorist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Wayne LaPierre, the head of the
National Rifle Association, frequently calls on members of his
organization to do the same thing. He is labeled a patriot by President
Trump. One anonymous freed slave argued in a 1789 speech that the
dehumanization of black people allowed white people to justify their
poor treatment, despite their proclaimed commitment to liberty. Both
well-regulated local militias of old, state-sanctioned police forces and
unregulated paramilitary organizations, like the Ku Klux Klan or
neighborhood watchmen, have brutalized and dehumanized black bodies in
this country since before its conception. For too long, white
communities have ignored the historical context of their own
freedom**[[. It is time for us to stop pretending that gun rights apply
universally in this country]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The so-called rights
that guarantee life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all men
have never truly applied to all men[. The so-called rights protected by
our Constitution, like the right to keep and bear arms, have not been
universally protected or applied. Black people are not given these
rights, and their attempts to realize them frequently result in their
death. As citizens of this country[, it is time for us to not only say
#NeverAgain]{.mark} or #EnoughIsEnough [to school shootings, **but to
say it for police brutality and racialized violence as
well.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#  1NC - Critical Framework: No Method

##  1NC

#### [Interpretation]{.underline}: The affirmative must defend a specific method of change to reduce US arms sales from status quo levels.

#### B. [Violation]{.underline}: The affirmative has not offered a political method to reduce U.S. arms sales.

#### C. [Reasons to Vote Negative]{.underline} -- 

#### 1. [Ground]{.underline} -- Failure to defend a specific method destroys neg ground taking away kritik and disad links as well as specific case turns to the method. And, we lose counterplan ground to offer an alternative method. The aff would just say permutation, the aff is not mutually exclusive with the counter method. Destroys any stasis point for the debate and unfairly privileges the affirmative. 

#### 2. [Method Specific Education Good]{.underline} -- Specific method debates allow left v left debates to weigh potential benefits and consequences of methods or political actions from within the leftist frame. Makes us better decision-makers around leftist politics, key to leftist advocacy skills and political planning. We must understand the complexity of internal operations of the state to guide tactics and strategies designed to produce material change. Debate can train activists and organizers on how to act against the state that forces the state into stances or actions contrary to its self-interest.

#### And, Black Radical Liberalism solves all your Offense: Black Radical Liberalism is the most promising candidate for an emancipatory political theory

**Mills 15** \[Charles, the John Evans Professor of Moral and
Intellectual Philosophy at Northwestern University, "BLACK RADICAL
LIBERALISM (and why it isn't an oxymoron)," Feb 23,
http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2015/02/black-radical-liberalism-and-why-it-isnt-an-oxymoron.html/AK47\]

**[["Black radical liberalism" is]{.underline}]{.mark}** my attempt to
reconstruct from different and usually counterposed bodies of political
thought what I see as **[[the most promising candidate for an
emancipatory African American political theory.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
So I am less concerned with the question of whether any African American
political theorists actually self-consciously identified what they were
doing under this designation than with the question of whether it stands
up to criticism as a plausible way forward. In taxonomies of African
American/black political thought, the standard contrast would be:1 I am
arguing for **[a synthesizing, reconstructed black
liberalism]{.underline}** which **[draws upon the most valuable insights
of the black nationalist and black Marxist traditions, and incorporates
them into a dramatically transformed liberalism.]{.underline}** So the
taxonomies would now be drawn differently: Screen Shot 2015-02-23 at
9.04.04 AM How does black radical liberalism differ from black
mainstream liberalism? By definition they are both "liberal" in
endorsing liberalism as a political philosophy, but **[black radical
liberalism seeks [to transform liberalism to make it responsive to the
alternative realities of the black diasporic experience in modernity,
and the correspondingly necessary reordering of liberal normative
priorities]{.mark}. Black radical liberalism both (i) recognizes white
supremacy as central to the making of the United States and (more
sweepingly) the modern world, and (ii) seeks the rethinking of the
categories, crucial assumptions, and descriptive and normative
frameworks of liberalism in the light of that
recognition.]{.underline}** Black mainstream liberalism either (i)
refuses to recognize white supremacy (for example, by endorsing the
"anomaly" view of U.S. racism \[see Rogers Smith, Civic Ideals:
Conflicting Visions of Citizenship in US History\]) or, (ii) even if it
does give lip service to its reality, assumes nonetheless that the
categories, crucial assumptions, and descriptive and normative
frameworks of liberalism can be adopted with little change to the task
of getting rid of it. OBJECTIONS: (1) But how can Marxist and liberal
insights be reconciled? Aren't they necessarily opposed? Liberalism
comes in different varieties, and black radical liberalism would
obviously be a left-wing variety. Liberalism is opposed to
state-commandist socialism, but state-commandist socialism has proved
itself to be a historical failure, both economically and morally.
Liberalism is not in principle opposed to social democracy or market
socialism. (2) But how can black nationalist insights be reconciled
either with Marxism or liberalism? Black nationalism likewise comes in
different varieties. The key insight of the tradition, in my opinion, is
the recognition of the reality and centrality of an ontology of race,
and how it shapes people and their psychology, which can be accommodated
in a modified Marxism and liberalism. (Obviously this means rejecting
essentialist versions of black nationalism, whether onto-theological or
culturalist. A "black Marxist"/"left nationalist" tradition has long
existed that addresses these issues: see, e.g., Lucius Outlaw, Critical
Social Theory in the Interests of Black Folks.) (3) But **[[how
can]{.mark} even [a "black radical liberalism"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(assuming it doesn't fly apart from centrifugal forces) **[[deal
with]{.mark} the problems identified by]{.underline}** Derrick Bell's
"racial realism," or more recent **[["Afro-pessimism"? There are no
guarantees, but then no other]{.mark} competing [ideology can offer them
either.]{.mark} Insofar as black radical liberalism is attentive
to]{.underline}** trends within **[capitalism]{.underline}** (e.g., the
forthcoming consolidation and exacerbation of plutocracy in the Western
world predicted by Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First
Century), it would hope that an increasing number of the white
poor/white working class may begin to wake up to the reality that the
prospects for their children and grandchildren under plutocratic
capitalism---albeit white-supremacist plutocratic capitalism---are not
that great either. As a materialist political philosophy, **[black
radical liberalism [does not rest its hopes for social transformation on
moral suasion]{.mark} alone, [but on]{.mark} the [mobilization of group
interests.]{.mark} The strategy would be to combine the racial justice
political project with a larger social justice political project,
highlighting the startling fact that the U.S. has the most unequal
distribution of income and wealth of all the Western
democracies.]{.underline}** So that (very sketchily) would be the
real-world agenda. Let us now look at the (academic world) implications
for Rawlsian liberalism. CHALLENGING MAINSTREAM WHITE POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY Screen Shot 2015-02-23 at 9.10.39 AM IDEAL vs. NON-IDEAL
THEORY In A Theory of Justice Rawls famously focuses on "ideal theory,"
the normative theory of a perfectly just society, one of "strict
compliance" with its principles of justice. Ideal theory, however, was
supposed to be the necessary preliminary to properly doing non-ideal
theory, including "compensatory justice." But 40+ years later, the
transition to theorizing "compensatory justice" has still not been made,
and contemporary Rawlsian discussions of non-ideal theory are dealing
with other senses of the term. Obviously, **[for a population
historically subordinated in modernity through slavery, colonialism, and
Jim Crow, non-ideal theory is the imperative. Afro-modern (as it is now
called) political philosophy is centrally shaped by the experience of
oppression, domination, exploitation, etc. So black radical liberalism
is going to be a variety of non-ideal-theory liberalism, liberalism
dealing with the overcoming of social oppression in a nominally liberal
society.]{.underline}** WELL-ORDERED vs. ILL-ORDERED SOCIETIES A related
distinction is the difference between well-ordered (perfectly just) and
(what I am going to call) ill-ordered societies. Rawls suggests we think
of societies as "cooperative ventures for mutual advantage." But **[[a
white supremacist state is not a cooperative venture for mutual
advantage.]{.underline}]{.mark}** To assume the cooperative-venture
characterization would be to rule racist societies out of normative
consideration from the start. So **[black radical liberalism rejects
such a stipulation. [Instead, it]{.mark} works with a conception of
society broad enough to include ill-ordered societies. Ill-ordered
societies are coercive rather than cooperative ventures, characterized
by exploitation and asymmetries of respect rather than mutual advantage
and reciprocal respect. Ill-ordered societies are, in other words, the
world.]{.underline}** CORRECTIVE JUSTICE In his A Short History of
Distributive Justice, Samuel Fleischacker points out that universal
distributive justice as a norm in the Western tradition is only slightly
more than 200 years old (and of course initially really just extends
over the "universe" of white males). At first, not even white women are
included (Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract), and certainly not people
of color in Western societies (Mills, The Racial Contract). "Corrective
justice" as a concept is even more undeveloped and untheorized,
especially where groups are concerned. Basic implication: Western
normative theory in general historically for most of 2500 years, and
liberalism for most of modernity, has been complicit with rather than
condemnatory of, group subordination. The under-theorization in the
tradition of corrective justice for subordinated groups, despite the
subordination of most of the population nominally in the theory's ambit,
is itself a manifestation of this complicity. **[Black radical
liberalism]{.underline}** reverses these normative priorities, and
**[[makes corrective justice its central concern.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#  2NC - Critical Framework: No Method

###  OV

#### The nexus question of this debate is whose model of debate creates the best training ground to create strategies to combat anti-black violence. Our mode creates the best strategies and activists which spills over to create material change through strategic engagements with the political. The 1AC Disneyland ethics allows for the material conditions to perpetuate. At best, it is inspirational but not material. Black girls will STILL be bullied. Black boys will STILL be shot down by the 12. Black women will STILL be harassed. 

###  FW PROPER 

#### Interpretation is that the 1ac should have defended a specific method of change to reduce United States arms sales from status quo levels

#### Violation: The affirmative has not a political method to reduce United States arms sales. 

#### Standards:

#### Ground - There is no specific method of execution that the 1ac provides. This means the aff gets a structural advantage 

#### We lose access to making arguments about how the inherent dangers of the resolution can co-op your advocacies and how the flawed power dynamic can co-opt the of the plan. We don't have access to K or Disad links to the specific mechanism of the aff. We also lose out of counterplan ground because aff will just perm because they have no method. 

#### This is true - on any counterplan debate. This should mean that they don't get access to any perm because they have nothing to permute the cp with. 

#### This ruins education because vague advocacies force us to make "racism good" arguments against their theory of power. The ground we lose prevents the most educational and revolutionary debates possible. Our model solves 

#### 2. Method Specific Education- The aff needs to be willing to use pressure on the state. As left v left debates, we need to be able to have debates about how arm sales are utilized to subjugate PoC. For example, the Black Panther Party supported political activists to get people at the local level to participate. The genealogical lesson that the aff outlines doesn't confront the material conditions that perpetuate violence that black people are victims of. The affirmative claims

#### 1.    The affirmative needs to promote material engagement that changes the squo and the neg should get the antagonism of the state.

#### 2.    Leftists Political Training- Specificity allows for nothing to be lost in translation. The aff doesn't provide any sort of mechanistic strategy to deal with the multiple dimensions of the problem. They have no practice in their praxis, which is detrimental when it comes time to confront actual instances of antiblackness. We have to be able to engage in the political in the face of violence rather than pornotroping suffering with no plan for material change.

#### 3.    Specific Method Debates allow us to weigh the costs and benefits from within the leftist frame which enables us to make us better decision makers around politics. This is key to building advocacy skills and political planning. The political module that we have to operate under demands us to engage in strategy.

#### [Violation]{.underline}: The performance of the 1AC refuses any engagement with the resolution. The 1AC is silent on the FMS and DCS programs. Discussion of US arms sales is muted by the affirmative.

#### [Reasons to Vote Negative:]{.underline} 

#### Topic Specific Education Good -- First is clash and education -- having an agreed-upon stasis point is critical for left on left debates, key to creating an accessible point of clash to evaluate the efficacy of radical political engagement---predictable ground and clash are key to evaluating whether the method of the affirmative is good for the people -- the ability to defend a position against a knowledgeable opponent is key to export leftist politics to help real communities. Otherwise radical politics turn into intellectual masturbation and neoliberal self-care strategies designed to limit black disruption of the State and capital. Debate is a multi-faceted training ground for the left to work out the costs and benefits of direct engagement with the political.

#### Ground Loss and In Round Abuse -- We lose all Disad and Kritik links to the topic, we lose topic specific case turns and all topic driven counterplan ground, including movements based arguments around US arms sales. They kill all neg ground, moot pre-tournament prep and gives the aff a side advantage.

**Rimmey, No Date (Dustin L. Rimmey is the director of debate and
forensics at Topeka High School in Topeka, Kansas. "High School Debate
Topic Paper 2019)**

Negative Ground: The Case Debate First, **[this topic provides a huge
opportunity for a good]{.underline}**, old ‐ school **[case
debate]{.underline}**. For the areas listed above in the affirmatives,
**[there is literature that questions whether or not reducing arms sales
make us safer, reduces blowback, or shore ‐ up relations]{.underline}**.
Second, I think **[there is a great debate over whether or not other
countries can/will fill in]{.underline}** (like China. Russia, Israel)
**[and if that mitigates solvency of the aff]{.underline}**. Third,
there is an interesting line of arguments on why we need market presence
to be a more credible shaper of arms policies. Finally, **[for each
person who claims we should stop selling arms to a country, there is
another who claims we should increase them.]{.underline}** The
Disadvantage Debate First, politics will rule the day as this topic
leads into a presidential election year. What makes **[this a good topic
for a politics disad]{.underline}** are the **[lobby specific and/or
state specific links that may figure into electoral math]{.underline}**.
**[Several states profit from arms/military sales and cutting back on
them could potentially swing some states from one party to
another]{.underline}**. Second, there will be a variety of economics
disads. There is **[an even amount of literature arguing that arms sales
both help/hinder the economy from a jobs or trade
perspective]{.underline}**. Additionally, there will be **[trade ‐
deficit disads to specific nations]{.underline}**. One of the reasons we
are so aggressive with arms sales (especially to India) is to reduce the
trade deficit as our arms technology is one of the few items they want
from us. Third, if the Aff does not read a relations advantage, then

#### Self-questioning turns the aff

**Goodin & Niemeyer '3** (Robert; Simon; 2003; Australian National
University; "When Does Deliberation Begin? Internal Reflection versus
Public Discussion in Deliberative Democracy"; Political Studies; Vol.
50; p. 627-649)

What happened [in]{.underline} this particular case, as in [any
particular case]{.underline}, was in some respects peculiar unto itself.
The problem of the Bloomfield Track had been well known and much
discussed in the local community for a long time. [Exaggerated claims
and counter-claims]{.underline} had [**become** entrenched, and
unreflective public opinion **polarized** around them]{.underline}. In
this circumstance, [the effect]{.underline} of the information phase [of
deliberative processes was to **brush away** those highly polarized
attitudes, **dispel** the myths and symbolic posturing on both sides
that had come to dominate the debate, and **liberate** people to act
upon their attitudes]{.underline} toward the protection of rainforest
itself. [The key point]{.underline}, from the perspective of 'democratic
deliberation within', [is]{.underline} that [that happened]{.underline}
in the earlier stages of deliberation -- **[before the formal
discussions]{.underline}** ('deliberations', in the discursive sense) of
the jury process ever began. The simple process of jurors seeing the
site for themselves, focusing their minds on the issues and listening to
what experts had to say did virtually all the work in changing jurors'
attitudes. **[Talking among themselves]{.underline}**, as a jury, **[did
very little]{.underline}** of it. However, the same might happen in
cases very different from this one. [Suppose that]{.underline} instead
of highly polarized symbolic attitudes, what [we have at the
outset]{.underline} is [mass ignorance or mass apathy]{.underline} or
non-attitudes. There again, [people's **engaging** with the
issue]{.underline} -- focusing on it, [**acquiring information** about
it, **thinking hard** about it -- would]{.underline} be something that
is likely to [occur earlier]{.underline} rather than later [in the
deliberative process]{.underline}. And more to our point, it is
something that is most likely to occur within individuals themselves or
in informal interactions, well in advance of any formal, organized group
discussion. [There is much]{.underline} in the large [literature on
attitudes and the mechanisms by which they change]{.underline} to
support that speculation.31 Consider, for example, the literature on
'central' versus 'peripheral' routes to the formation of attitudes.
[Before deliberation, individuals may not]{.underline} have
[give]{.underline}n [the issue much thought or bothered to
engage]{.underline} in [an extensive process of
reflection]{.underline}.32 [In such cases, positions may be
arrived]{.underline} at [via]{.underline} peripheral routes, taking
[**cognitive shortcuts** or arriving at **'top of the head'
conclusions** or even]{.underline} simply [**following the lead** **of
others**]{.underline} believed to hold similar attitudes or values
(Lupia, 1994). These shorthand approaches involve the use of available
cues such as 'expertness' or 'attractiveness' (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986)
-- not deliberation in the internal-reflective sense we have described.
[Where peripheral shortcuts are employed, there may be
**inconsistencies** in logic and the formation of positions, based
on]{.underline} partial information or **[incomplete information
processing]{.underline}**. In contrast, ['central' routes
to]{.underline} [the development of attitudes involve]{.underline} the
application of [more deliberate effort]{.underline} to the matter at
hand, [in a way]{.underline} that is more [akin to]{.underline} the
[internal-reflective deliberative ideal]{.underline}. Importantly for
our thesis, there is nothing intrinsic to the 'central' route that
requires group deliberation. Research in this area stresses instead the
importance simply of 'sufficient impetus' for engaging in deliberation,
such as when an individual is stimulated by personal involvement in the
issue.33 The same is true of 'on-line' versus 'memory-based' processes
of attitude change.34 The suggestion here is that [we lead our ordinary
lives]{.underline} largely [on autopilot, doing routine things in
routine ways without]{.underline} much [thought]{.underline} or
reflection. [When we come across something 'new', we update our
routines]{.underline} -- our 'running' beliefs and pro cedures,
attitudes and evaluations -- accordingly. But having updated, we then
drop the impetus for the update into deep-stored 'memory'. A consequence
of this procedure is that, [when asked in the ordinary course of events
'what we believe' or 'what attitude we take' toward something,
we]{.underline} easily [retrieve what we think but we
cannot]{.underline} so easily [retrieve the reasons why]{.underline}.
[That]{.underline} more **[fully reasoned assessment]{.underline}** --
the sort of thing we have been calling [**internal-reflective
deliberation** -- requires us to call up reasons]{.underline} from
stored memory [rather than just consulting our]{.underline} running
on-line '[summary judgments']{.underline}. Crucially for our present
discussion, once again, [what prompts that shift from online to more
**deeply reflective deliberation** is]{.underline} not necessarily
interpersonal discussion. The impetus for **[fixing one's attention on a
topic]{.underline}**, and retrieving reasons from stored memory, might
come from any of a number sources: group discussion is only one. And
again, even [in the context of a group discussion, this
shift]{.underline} from 'online' to 'memory-based' processing [is likely
to occur earlier rather than later]{.underline} in the process, often
[before the formal discussion ever begins]{.underline}. All this is
simply to say that, on a great many models and in a great many different
sorts of settings, it seems likely that [elements of the pre-discursive
process are]{.underline} likely to prove [crucial to]{.underline} the
**[shaping and reshaping]{.underline}** of [people's
attitudes]{.underline} in a citizens' jury-style process.
[The]{.underline} initial [processes of **focusing attention on a
topic**, providing information about it and inviting people to **think
hard**]{.underline} about it [is likely to]{.underline} provide a strong
impetus to internal-reflective deliberation, [alter]{.underline}ing [not
just the information people have]{.underline} about the issue [but also
the way people **process that information** and]{.underline} hence
(perhaps) what they **[think about the issue]{.underline}**. What
happens once [people]{.underline} have [shift]{.underline}ed [into
this]{.underline} more **[internal-reflective mode]{.underline}** is,
obviously, an open question. Maybe people would then come to an easy
consensus, as they did in their attitudes toward the Daintree
rainforest.35 Or maybe people would come to divergent conclusions; and
[they]{.underline} then [may]{.underline} (or may not) [be **open** to
argument and counter-argument, with talk **actually changing
minds**]{.underline}. Our claim is not that group discussion will always
matter as little as it did in our citizens' jury.36 [Our claim
is]{.underline} instead merely [that the earliest steps in
the]{.underline} jury [process -- the sheer focusing of attention on the
issue]{.underline} at hand [and acquiring more information about it, and
the internal-reflective deliberation that that prompts --
will]{.underline} invariably [**matter more** than]{.underline}
deliberative democrats of [a more discursive stripe]{.underline} would
have us believe. However much or little difference formal group
discussions might make, on any given occasion, [the pre-discursive
phases]{.underline} of the jury process [will]{.underline} invariably
[have a **considerable impact** on changing the way jurors approach an
issue]{.underline}. From Citizens' Juries to Ordinary Mass Politics? In
a citizens' jury sort of setting, then, it seems that [informal,
pre-group deliberation]{.underline} -- 'deliberation within' --
[will]{.underline} inevitably [do much of the work that deliberative
democrats]{.underline} ordinarily [want to attribute to]{.underline} the
more [formal discursive processes]{.underline}. [What are the
preconditions for that happening?]{.underline} To what extent, in that
sense, can findings about citizens' juries be extended to other larger
or less well-ordered deliberative settings? Even in citizens' juries,
deliberation will work only if people are attentive, open and willing to
change their minds as appropriate. So, too, in mass politics. In
citizens' juries the need to participate (or the anticipation of
participating) in formally organized group discussions might be the
'prompt' that evokes those attributes. But there might be many other
possible 'prompts' that can be found in less formally structured
mass-political settings. Here are a few ways citizens' juries (and all
cognate micro-deliberative processes)37 might be different from mass
politics, and in which lessons drawn from that experience might not
therefore carry over to ordinary politics: • [A citizens' jury
concentrates people's minds on a single issue]{.underline}. [Ordinary
politics involve many issues at once]{.underline}. • [A citizens' jury
is]{.underline} often [supplied a background briefing that has been
agreed by all stakeholders]{.underline} (Smith and Wales, 2000, p. 58).
[In ordinary]{.underline} mass [politics, there is rarely]{.underline}
any equivalent [**common ground** on which debates are
conducted]{.underline}. • A citizens' jury separates the process of
acquiring information from that of discussing the issues. In ordinary
mass politics, those processes are invariably intertwined. • A citizens'
jury is provided with a set of experts. They can be questioned, debated
or discounted. But there is a strictly limited set of 'competing
experts' on the same subject. In ordinary mass politics, claims and
sources of expertise often seem virtually limitless, allowing for much
greater 'selective perception'. • [Participating in]{.underline}
something called [a 'citizens' jury' evokes]{.underline} certain [very
particular norms: norms concerning]{.underline} the
'[impartiality']{.underline} appropriate to jurors; [norms concerning
the 'common good']{.underline} orientation appropriate to people in
their capacity as citizens.38 There is a very different ethos at work in
ordinary mass politics, which are typically driven by flagrantly
partisan appeals to sectional interest (or utter disinterest and voter
apathy). • In a citizens' jury, we think and listen in anticipation of
the discussion phase, knowing that we soon will have to defend our views
in a discursive setting where they will be probed intensively.39 In
ordinary mass-political settings, there is no such incentive for paying
attention. It is perfectly true that [citizens' juries are 'special'
in]{.underline} all [those ways]{.underline}. But [if being
special]{.underline} in all those ways [makes for a better -- more
'reflective', more 'deliberative' -- political process]{.underline},
then [those are design features]{.underline} that [we ought]{.underline}
try [to mimic]{.underline} as best we can [in ordinary]{.underline} mass
[politics as well]{.underline}. [There are various ways
that]{.underline} that [might be done]{.underline}. Briefing books might
be prepared by sponsors of American presidential debates (the League of
Women Voters, and such like) in consultation with the stakeholders
involved. Agreed panels of experts might be questioned on prime-time
television. [Issues might be sequenced for **debate** **and**
**resolution**, to avoid too much competition for people's time and
attention]{.underline}. Variations on the Ackerman and Fishkin (2002)
proposal for a 'deliberation day' before every election might be
generalized, with a day every few months being given over to small
meetings in local schools to discuss public issues. All that is pretty
visionary, perhaps. And (although it is clearly beyond the scope of the
present paper to explore them in depth) there are doubtless many other
more-or-less visionary ways of introducing into real-world politics
analogues of the elements that induce citizens' jurors to practice
'democratic deliberation within', even before the jury discussion gets
underway. Here, we have to content ourselves with identifying [those
features]{.underline} that [need to be replicated in **real-world
politics** in order to achieve that goal]{.underline} -- and with the
'possibility theorem' that is established by the fact that (as sketched
immediately above) there is at least one possible way of doing that for
each of those key features.

#  1NC- Black Radical Affs. Israel/Palestine 1NC

#### [Interpretation:]{.underline} 

#### Solidarity with Palestine requires applying political pressure in the US to force the State to Withdraw Political and Financial Support for Israel -- The affirmative should defend US policy action to reduce arms sales to Israel as a form of topical solidarity.

#### [Violation:]{.underline} While the 1AC kritiks US Foreign Policy toward Israel, it does not advocate for a specific change in US arms sales to Israel. The aff is only topic adjacent.

#### [Reasons to Vote Negative]{.underline}: 

#### Education: While the conflict with Israel and Palestine has captured the US imagination, little is known by the average American about the internal workings of US arms sales and foreign policy toward Israel. Affirming specific actions to reduce US arms sales is critical to developing the knowledge and skills to effect change in US policy.

drive it, the companies that profit from it, and [[its devastating
global impacts are rarely discussed, much less analyzed in any

regular coverage while trends in weapons exports remain in relative
obscurity? Are we ashamed of standing essentially alone as the world's
No. 1 arms dealer, or is our Weapons "R" Us role so commonplace that we
take it for granted, like death or taxes? The numbers should stagger
anyone. According to the latest figures available from the Congressional
Research Service, the United States was credited with [more than
half](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44320.pdf) the value of all global
arms transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent year for which full
statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world's second largest
supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. [Washington's leadership in this
field has never truly been challenged.]{.underline} The US share has
fluctuated between one-third and one-half of the global market for the
past two decades, [peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent of all
weapons sold in 2011]{.underline}. And the gold rush continues. Vice
Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the Pentagon's arms sales agency,
euphemistically known as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency,
[estimates](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-britain-usa-arms-idUSKCN0ZT0ZH)
[that arms deals facilitated by the Pentagon topped \$46 billion in
2015, and are on track to hit \$40 billion in 2016.]{.underline} To be
completely accurate, [there is one group of people who pay remarkably
close attention]{.underline} to these trends---[executives of the
defense contractors that are cashing in on this growth
market.]{.underline} With the Pentagon and related agencies taking in
"only" about [\$600 billion a
year](http://armscontrolcenter.org/fy-2016-defense-budget-request-briefing-book/)---high
by historical standards but tens of billions of dollars less than hoped
for by the defense industry---companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon,
and General Dynamics have been looking to global markets as their major
source of new revenue. In a January 2015 investor call, for example,
Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson was asked whether the Iran nuclear
deal brokered by the Obama administration and five other powers might
reduce tensions in the Middle East, undermining the company's strategy
of increasing its arms exports to the region. She
[responded](https://theintercept.com/2015/03/20/asked-iran-deal-potentially-slowing-military-sales-lockheed-martin-ceo-says-volatility-brings-growth/)
that [continuing "volatility" in both the Middle East and Asia would
make them "growth areas" for the foreseeable future. In other words, no
worries. As long as the world stays at war or on the verge of
it]{.underline}, Lockheed Martin's profits won't suffer---and, of
course, its products will help ensure that any such volatility will
prove lethal indeed. nder Hewson, Lockheed has set a goal of getting [at
least 25
percent](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/14/obama-arms-fair-camp-david-weapons-sales-gcc/)
of its revenues from weapons exports, and Boeing has done that company
one better. It's seeking to make overseas arms sales [30
percent](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aero-arms-summit-boeing-idUSTRE7867Q720110907)
of its business. **[Arms deals are a way of life in
Washington.]{.underline}** From the president on down[, significant
parts of the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will
flood the global market and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will live
the good life]{.underline}. From the president on his trips abroad to
visit allied world leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to
the staffs of US embassies, American officials regularly act as
salespeople for the arms firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler. From
brokering, facilitating, and literally banking the money from arms deals
to transferring weapons to favored allies on the taxpayers' dime, it is
in essence the world's largest arms dealer. In a typical sale, the US
government is
[involved](http://www.dsca.mil/2014-foreign-customer-guide/security-cooperation-overview)
every step of the way. The Pentagon often does assessments of an allied
nation's armed forces in order to tell them what they "need"---and of
course what they always need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied
equipment. Then [the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the
deal]{.underline}, [notifies
Congress](http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales) of its details[, and
collects the funds from the foreign buyer, which it then gives to the US
supplier in the form of a defense contract. In most deals, the Pentagon
is also the point of contact for maintenance and spare parts for any
US-supplied system]{.underline}. The bureaucracy that helps make all of
this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, is funded from a
3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it negotiates. This gives it all the
more incentive to sell, sell, sell. [Though seldom thought of this way,
the US political system is also a global arms distribution system of the
first order]{.underline}. In this context, the Obama administration has
proven itself a good friend to arms exporting firms. During President
Obama's first six years in office, Washington entered into agreements to
sell more than [\$190
billion](http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/wp-content/uploads/historical_facts_book_30_september_2014_web.pdf)
in weaponry worldwide---more, that is, than any US administration since
World War II. In addition, Team Obama has [loosened
restrictions](https://www.propublica.org/article/in-big-win-for-defense-industry-obama-rolls-back-limits-on-arms-export)
on arms exports, making it possible to send abroad a whole new range of
weapons and weapons components---including Black Hawk and Huey
helicopters and engines for C-17 transport planes---with far less
scrutiny than was previously required. This has been good news for the
industry, which had been pressing for such changes for decades with
little [success. But the weaker regulations also make it potentially
easier for arms smugglers and human rights abusers to get their hands on
US arms. For example, 36 US allies---from Argentina and Bulgaria to
Romania and Turkey---will no longer need licenses from the State
Department to import weapons]{.underline} and weapons parts from the
United States. This will make it far easier for smuggling networks to
set up front companies in such countries and get US arms and arms
components that they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or
China. Already a common practice[, it will only increase under the new
regulations. The degree to which the Obama administration has been
willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored
at a 2013 hearing on those administration export "reforms."]{.underline}
Tom Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when
asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American
arms exports. **[[There is]{.mark}, however, [unlikely to be a genuine
public debate about the value of the arms business and Washington's
place in it if it isn't even considered a subject worthy of more than an
occasional media story.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[In the meantime, the
United States continues to hold onto its No. 1 role in the global arms
trade, the White House does its part, the Pentagon greases the wheels,
and the dollars roll in to profit-hungry weapons
contractors.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Switch Side Debate Good: You can do this on the negative to answer plan based Israel/Palestine Affs and go for coalitional movements solve the case harm better. Critical Switch Side Debate is Good and key to all your offense -- Black SSD proves hard left affs can be both topical and anti the state and civil society. Conviction Based Debate (CBD) results in debates where the debaters have already decided their position in debate and the world such that we do not consider our relationship to Others. It produces insular debates that destroy education, ethics and reproduces anti-blackness 

**Evans 12** \[Rashad, JD., Black debate extraordinare and JD, "The
1NC," Nov 20, http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/\]

Now, the debate! First, let me look at Casey Harrigan's ("CH")
definition of SSD. He says that : Definition: switch side debate (SSD)
is the practice that requires debaters to argue both for and against a
given topic in alternating rounds. In effect, it has meant that
debaters' arguments are divorced from personal conviction and instead
made contingently as a means of "testing" the truth value of a
proposition. I will accept this definition, but I think it requires some
more refinement. In a practical sense, **[[SSD]{.mark}, at a minimum,
[requires that the affirmative defend the
resolution.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For the most part, the negative is
unconstrained (except by competition) and most debates in which SSD
comes up the question is whether the affirmative team should be required
to affirm the topic, including some defense of an action by the United
States Federal Government ("USFG"). **[[The essential question posed by
SSD is whether the affirmative team should be required to defend the
resolution even when they (1) fundamentally disagree with all or part of
it and/or (2) are compelled to affirm other ideas because of their
"personal convictions]{.underline}."]{.mark}** The answer to this
question must be yes. First, **[[there are multiple
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** to skin a cat and even more ways [t**[o
affirm the resolution]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the world of
parametric debate because [one need only affirm an interpretation of the
resolution and not the resolution writ large.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Therefore, **[[there are rare instances in which there is no
interpretation of the resolution that you cannot defend and these rare
instances are most likely the product of lack of creativity and
research]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So in reality, the question is an even
simpler one: should the affirmative team be required to defend an
interpretation of the resolution. There are immense constitutive and
instrumental benefits to SSD that cannot be otherwise obtained and
therefore must be required. I ask that the judges: George, Justin and
Kyla evaluate this debate holistically, which requires that they
evaluate the benefits of SSD to the speaker (constitutive) and to
society (instrumental). This also requires that they exclude nothing in
their analysis of this debate. The Constitutive **[Debaters benefit from
SSD. It requires that they engage in topics that they may not otherwise
engage.]{.underline}** The resolution poses a unique question and the
debate round is a unique time to answer that question. One is much more
likely to consider their personal convictions outside of the debate
round than they are to consider the resolution outside the debate round.
**[Therefore, independently of whether one agrees with the resolution or
not, there are benefits to [defending]{.mark} an interpretation of [the
resolution]{.mark} in that it [requires you to consider
something]{.mark} you may not have [otherwise]{.mark} considered. These
[thought expiriments create more informed and thoughtful
debaters]{.mark} and citizens.]{.underline}** **[SSD creates a unique
opportunity for self-reflexivity.]{.underline}** The idea is to let your
personal convictions guide you in the debate. **[[The resolution doesn't
require that you suppress your identity]{.mark} or convictions, but is
instead an opportunity to infuse that identity and those convictions
into the resolution and public policy discussion.]{.underline}** So,
given who you are, what you believe and what you know what say you
regarding energy production? What say you regarding democracy
assistance? What say you regarding federal control in Indian Country?
Therefore, **[[the resolution is an opportunity for you to refine your
personal convictions and put your identity in politics instead of
relying exclusively on identity politics.]{.mark} SSD allows you to
check your own privilege.]{.underline}** Here, I will rely on my
personal experience. I once participated in a 30 day creative challenge
where the challenge leader would pose questions on facebook and the
group would answer them in the comments section. One day he asked us to
imagine we could be the other gender for 3 days and to discuss what
would we do. I thought about this on the A-train from Harlem to Chelsea
and again from Chelsea to Harlem and had no answer because I couldn't
imagine being a woman. I explained that as a gay man I don't need to be
a woman to have sex with a man, I don't want a baby in me and more
importantly I don't want the physical vulnerability of being a woman.
This realization really forced me to reevaluate my previous jokes even
that as a gay many I was ontologically indistinct from a woman. I am
not. I am gay and I am black...in many ways I am the the worlds bottom,
but even I could would not want to occupy the body of a woman. That
thought experiment taught me a lot about myself, privilege and the
world. Sometimes, you have to take a walk in someone else's stiletto to
learn who you really are. Seriously CH, have you walked in stilettos? It
will change your life. **[[SSD is both necessary and sufficient to
ensure that you debate your personal convictions.]{.mark} Remember, if
you are staunchly opposed to the resolution [you get to]{.mark}
[lodge]{.mark} those [complaints on the negative.]{.mark} Also, remember
that what is good for the goose is good for the gander and [if you don't
have to debate the resolution then no one has to]{.mark} debate the
resolution. [This]{.mark} loosening of the restrictions on the
resolution may [mean that no one gets to debate anything they
want.]{.mark}]{.underline}** I mean lets face it, no one wants to be
topical! There's always a better version of your aff that isn't topical.
Every 2AC considers severance or intrinsicness because the resolution is
flawed or insufficient. However, a true debater understands that they
both have **[to debate on the affirmative and the
negative]{.underline}** and that in order to do either **[effectively
[there must be stability in the relationship between the
aff]{.mark}irmative [and]{.mark} the [neg]{.mark}ative.]{.underline}**
Therefore, committing yourself to the resolution is key preserving your
own negative ground to engage in your critique of the resolution. As
goes the resolution so goes your personal convictions about that
resolution. The Instrumental **[SSD is the only way to organize a fair
debate tournament.]{.underline}** We must have a topic. There must be
rules and allowing any and everyone go rogue because of their "personal
convictions" it is a recipe for disaster. I don't want to live and
debate in that world. **[There must be strict requirements on defending
the resolution to allow for fair and predictable negative
ground.]{.underline}** By the way, protecting **[[fair negative ground
is easier and more important than all other concerns regarding
fairness.]{.mark} All people of all convictions have to be negative at
some point. Which means that [the affirmative-negative dialiectic is the
only intersectional analysis]{.mark} that can be performed
[because]{.mark} all people of [all identities will eventually find
themselves]{.mark} on the [aff]{.mark}irmative or [neg]{.mark}ative side
in debate. Preserving negative ground then preserves the ground of
women, minorities and hippies.]{.underline}** SSD ensures that we have
all hands on deck in these extraordinary times. We need all perspectives
and all peoples to engage in all debates. SSD facilitates this.
**[Allowing students to pick their own topic because of their "[personal
convictions"]{.mark} may [mean that important issues get ignored]{.mark}
all together.]{.underline}** I mean, what would happen if we let the
students set the curriculum? Would they learn anything, ever? How many
times have you heard these questions in a classroom: why do I have to
learn this? Will this be on the exam? My major is X, why do I need to
learn Y? Blah. Yes, students would almost always like to do what they
want to do. If we allowed this where would we be as a country? Who will
be there to tackle the important questions pertaining to immigration,
energy production, the Arab Spring, etc? **[Engaging the resolution from
your specific social location can cause others to change their
views.]{.underline}** There are several examples of creative
interpretations of the resolution that have inspired folk to view the
topic and life differently. This is when debate is at its best and when
it's engaging in important knowledge production. Debate and debaters
have the potential to infuse new arguments, ideas and perspectives into
the resolution and into the broader discussion. Now, the line by line!
CH says: 1. It presumes debate as a "pedagogical bull-pen", which
undermines the activity's potential for radical change. Students are
told "you can't know anything until you debate both sides", ignoring the
VAST WEALTH of lived experience that underwrites specific claims about
identity, the world, praxis, and the topic. In some ways, it is like
Loyola's argument about info accumulation -- we are told to place a hold
on "conviction" until we have "enough information" and "enough testing"
when in reality there is either never a point where "enough is enough"
OR we have \*already\* crossed that point and should be able to utilize
the debate space for advocacy. It makes debate into a game about
hypothetical action rather than a potential site for social justice.
First, there are radically topical interpretations of the resolution.
Second, **[how does one know that their lived experience is dispositive
of any debate without testing it against the research and lived
experiences of others. It's not that you can't know anything until you
debate both sides but more importantly that you debate both sides before
you conclude you know anything. Lastly, [there is no internal link
between resolutional debate and the loss of social justice.]{.mark} In
fact, [one should always debate the resolution in a way that produces
social justice.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 2. It is anti-Black. The norm of
SSD and topic construction mandating USFG action presume that public
policy is valuable because it is equally accessible to all participants,
when in reality access is ANYTHING BUT that, relies on a belief that
USFG action is a locus for change when in reality and history it has
produced the opposite, marginalizes individual perspectives as "too
local", and does not account for the specific conditions of Black
participation in debate. Your anti-Blackness argument is without
warrant. **[[To the extent that anti-Blackness is a problem, SSD is the
solution.]{.mark} Certainly, holding on to ones conviction in avoidance
of debate has never benefited Black people in the past[. Thinking itself
is Blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}** (whiteness is anti-thought), **[[so
avoiding a debate because of personal conviction is quintessentially
anti-Black.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In fact, many of debates current ills
stem from people avoiding debates and holding fast to their convictions.
**[Also, [the USFG is not uniquely anti-Black. The world is anti-Black,
so to isolate the USFG is to]{.mark} fundamentally [misunderstand
Blackness.]{.mark} The USFG has been a locus for change where others
have failed. For instance, the civil rights act regulated the racist
behavior of private individuals and corporations.]{.underline}** School
desegregation required federal intervention to ensure state compliance
with the constitution. The Violence Against Women's Act regulates
individual behavior in the home which was once considered a private
matter. **[This is not to suggest that [the USFG]{.mark} is a saint, but
to suggest that the [question requires more nuance]{.mark} and that
nuance is [provided only by SSD.]{.mark} The specific conditions of
Blackness require SSD.]{.underline}** After years of exclusion from
education generally and debate specifically, its right time that we jump
into the discussions. **[[Black SSD not equal white SSD.]{.mark} Black
debaters are the future and they will remake the world partially in an

#### Education- Ext Hartung 1. Our instance of political analysis of arm sales initiates material engagement in how police militarization creates the conditions for subjugated black communities. Functionally, their analysis doesn't provide a way to implement a change in international arm sales. There are 3 impacts:

#### A.    Anti blackness v imperialism: A mechanism of colonialism that the US still employs is to not inform the public about arm sales to foreign nations like Egypt, Honduras, etc. The aff perpetuates this by not educating the debate space on the topic of foreign military arm sales or DCS that have exacerbated antiblackness worldwide.

#### B.     Protesting does nothing when the US continues to portray power through this key aspect of imperialism. Our model of debate ensures we can talk about material strategies.

#### C.    Kritikal scholarship: Our model of debate ensures we can talk about material strategies. There is more than enough critical knowledge on us imperialism and arm sales that enables the aff to still access their advantages .

It's crucial to make this connection, right? For people to understand
that we are all neighbors because otherwise that's where racism starts.
When people think along the line that a Black person doesn't have the
same genes as a white one... One of the things I've been thinking about
in relation to the need to diversify movements in solidarity with
Palestine is that, the tendency is to approach issues about which one is
passionate within a narrow framework. People do this whatever their
concerns are. But especially with the Palestine solidarity movement. My
experience has been that many people assume that in order to be involved
with Palestine, you have to be an expert. So people are afraid to join
because they say, "I don't understand. It's so complicated." Then they
hear someone who is truly an expert, who does indeed represent the
movement, who is so thoroughly informed about the history of the
conflict, who speaks about the failure of the Oslo Accords, et cetera,
when this happened and why it's important, **[[but too often people feel
that they are not sufficiently informed to consider themselves an
advocate of justice in Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
question is how to create windows and doors for people who believe in
justice to enter and join the Palestine solidarity movement. So that the
question of how to bring movements together is also a question of the
kind of language one uses and the consciousness one tries to
impart.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[I think it's important to insist on
the intersectionality of movements. In the abolition movement, we've
been trying to find ways to talk about Palestine so that people who are
attracted to a campaign to dismantle prisons in the US will also think
about the need to end the occupation in Palestine. It can't be an
afterthought. It has to be a part of the ongoing

Moreover, it was not until the year 2008---only five years ago---that
Mandela's name was taken off the terrorist watch list, when George W.
Bush signed a bill that finally removed him and other members of the ANC
from the list. In other words when Mandela visited the US after his
release in 1990, and when he later visited as South Africa's president,
he was still on the terrorist list and the requirement that he be banned
from the US had to be expressly waived. The point I am making is that
for a very long time, Mandela and his comrades shared the same status as
numerous Palestinian leaders and activists today and that just as the
**[[US explicitly collaborated with the SA apartheid government, it
continues to support the Israeli occupation of Palestine, currently in
the form of over \$8.5 million a day in military
aid.]{.underline}]{.mark}** We need to let the Obama administration know
that the world knows how deeply the US is implicated in the occupation.
It is an honor to participate in this meeting, especially as one of the
members of the International Political Prisoners Committee calling for
the freedom of Palestinian political prisoners, recently formed in Cape
Town, and also as a member of the jury of the Russell Tribunal on
Palestine. I would like to thank War on Want for sponsoring this meeting
and progressive students, faculty, and workers at SOAS, for making it
possible for us to be here this evening. This evening's gathering
specifically focuses on **[[the importance of expanding the BDS
movement---the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement called for by
Palestinian civil society]{.underline}]{.mark}**---which has been
crafted along the lines of the powerful model of the antiapartheid
movement with respect to South Africa. While there [numerous
transnational corporations have been identified as targets of the
boycott, Veolia]{.mark} for example, as well as [Sodastream, Ahava,
Caterpillar, Boeing, Hewlett Packard]{.mark}, and others, we are
focusing our attention this evening on [G4S]{.mark}. **[[G4S is
especially important because it participates directly and blatantly in
the maintenance and reproduction of repressive apparatuses in
Palestine---prisons, checkpoints, the apartheid wall, to name only a few
examples. G4S represents the growing insistence on what is called
"security" under the neoliberal state and ideologies of security that
bolster not only the privatization of security but the privatization of
imprisonment, the privatization of warfare, as well as the privatization
of health care and education.]{.mark}]{.underline}** G4S is responsible
for the repressive treatment of political prisoners inside Israel.
Through Addameer, directed by Sahar Francis, we have learned about the
terrifying universe of torture and imprisonment which is faced by so
many Palestinians but also about their hunger strikes and other forms of
resistance.

in]{.underline}]{.mark}** Britain, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,
and **[[Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This company is the

Africa.]{.mark} **[[It has learned how to profit from racism,
anti-immigrant practices, and from technologies of punishment in Israel
and throughout the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[G4S is directly
responsible for the ways Palestinians experience political
incarceration]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as well as aspects of the
apartheid wall, imprisonment in South Africa, prison-like schools in the
United States, and the wall along the US-Mexico border.]{.mark}

operates sexual assault centers in Britain.

#  2NC - Critical Framework: Reject the Topic

#  1NC - Critical A-Spec T

#### Interpretation: The affirmative must specify the agent or agents of the method they advocate.

#### Violation: The affirmative has offered \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ method for engaging the resolution, but does not specify who would or should participate in the method of the 1AC. It is unclear who the actor is in the 1AC.

#### Reasons to prefer our interpretation

#### Kills neg ground -- The affirmative prevents the negative from developing specific links to the method. It prevents the negative from questioning the solvency of the method or counterplaning with a different agent or set of agents. Hurts pre-round prep. Forces the negative to wait until cross x of the 1AC to press for information about the agent of action. Encourage vague methods. Aff already has infinite prep time and speaks first and last.

#### Limits -- Our interpretation allows for creative interpretations of the resolution and does not require the affirmative to role-play the USFG as the agent. Such a big tent approach makes a large topic even bigger and requires extensive research preparation. At the very least if the affirmative takes away our USFG based link, CP and K ground, the least they can do is specify the agent/s of the affirmatives method. Allowing the affirmative to defend agentless methods unlimits the resolution making negative research unmanageable. 

## 2NC ASPEC Ovw

#### The nexus question of this debate is which model of debate is best to produce topic-specific education, a fair playing field, and a model in which both the aff and neg can access the protest the affirmative claims to make. We argue that identifying the agent is critical to have an identifiable protest that is key to engaging with it outside of round and negating it inside of round. The aff must have a specific agent, but they only say we some people without specifying who is included in that definition. By not including the agent, there is no stable ground and they explode limits \-- The impacts are education and fairness. 

### Ground

#### Not specifying an agent kills core negative ground. Broad terms like "we some people" don't indicate anything about who is and isn't the agent, which prevents us from reading any sort of agent counterplan because the 2ac can inevitably make a perm shifting the advocacy to encompass the counterplan, or we decide to read a PIC the 2ac can reclarify the actor to spike out of the pics offense. This is a terrible framework for left v left debates because having nuanced debates about the strengths and weaknesses of certain agents in different movements is key to effective political strategizing. 

###  Limits

#### The affirmative does not have to use the USFG as its agent, rather it has to provide a specific movement or group of people that would participate in the advocacy, this could be like the Black Panther Party, Black Lives Matter, Jews for Justice in Palestine, etc. Identifying the agent prevents the affirmative from shifting in the 2ac and 1ar because shifting results in an infinite amount of agents that the negative can never predict and thus never adjust to answer. An unspecified agent means the aff explodes limits and means the negative is literally expected to prepare for billions of agents - every person, animal, political group, etc which isn't specified can be shifted to in the 2ac. Exploding limits means the neg has an unfair research burden to meet and disincentivizes deeper research. Identifying the agent is also better for education on the aff because it means the affirmative has to research specific movements which means that the aff accesses a deeper understanding of the topic and protests of the topic - this is a link turn because our model of debate provides for a better form of protest in which the protest is identifiable and thus can produce structural change in debate. 

###  Black Framework: Conflict vs Antagonism

#### Interpretation: The affirmative should identify a conflict in the status quo and offer a material solution to resolve that problem. Wilderson defines the difference between conflict and antagonism

Drama at UC Irvine, Ph.D. in Rhetoric/Film Studies from UC Berkeley,

[[This grammar can be discerned]{.underline}]{.mark} in the cinematic
strategies (lighting, camera angles, image composition, and acoustic
design), even when [the script labors for the spectator to imagine
social turmoil [through the rubric of conflict]{.mark} (i.e., a rubric
of [problems that can be posed and conceptually solved) as opposed to
the rubric of antagonism (an irreconcilable struggle between entities ,
or positions , the resolution of which is not dialectical but entails
the obliteration of one of the positions]{.mark}]{.underline}). In other
words, even when films narrate a story in which Blacks or Indians are
beleaguered with problems that the script insists are conceptually
coherent (usually having to do with poverty or the absence of \"family
values\"), the nonnarrative , or cinematic, strategies of the film often
disrupt this coherence by posing the irreconcilable questions of Red and
Black political ontology---or nonontology. [The grammar of antagonism

#### The events in Charlottesville have remained in the headlines for the last few weeks for a variety of reasons. Surprise at the audacity of a torch-light procession of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, and "alt-rightists" in an American city, coupled with the murder of social justice activist Heather Heyer during a counterdemonstration, fueled the initial coverage. President Trump's abhorrent response to the tragedy and local struggles against Confederate statues kept it alive. And frequently dimwitted debates about the merits of antifa have supplied yet more conversational oxygen. But it would be a mistake for the American left to see this as a decisive turning point in history, or mistake torch-wielding fascists for a mass force. On the contrary: getting consumed by debates about supporting antifa in its street clashes with neo-Nazis misses the larger political landscape. [[The post-Charlottesville moment does demand antiracist mobilizations]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it's heartening that left organizations have sprung into action and seen their numbers swell. Standing up to the far right --- particularly when done effectively and en masse, like in Boston --- can energize people who are otherwise frustrated and disenchanted because of the Trump administration. [[But]{.mark} that [needs]{.mark} to be linked to [tangible]{.mark} political [organizing]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [goes beyond the]{.mark} [defensive]{.mark} or [symbolic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Discussions about antifa are also important. Interviews with counter-protestors on the ground in Charlottesville made it clear they were more than happy antifa was there to help. In fact, Cornel West credited them with saving his life. But the debate over antifa cannot be at the center of left political discussion. [I am less concerned about being murdered by a neo-Nazi than I am about the lack of access to quality health care]{.underline}. I am more exercised about the suppression of voting rights and the damage it does to democracy in the here and now than the damage simply represented by Confederate statues. This is not to dismiss the efforts to tear down Confederate statutes. What lies in the public commons, after all, needs to represent the kind of country we want the United States to be. But we shouldn't allow the conflagration to cloud our vision. In short, the lessons post-Charlottesville are the lessons we should have learned earlier this year. [[We cannot simply react to Trump]{.mark} or the "alt-right." Being proactive, advancing a clear program that can mobilize and galvanize a huge swath of the public --- this must be the hallmark of the American left. Otherwise, [the genuine]{.mark} [anger]{.mark} [directed]{.mark} [at Trump]{.mark} [and the GOP]{.mark} [will be wasted.]{.mark} And [we'll squander our chance to build]{.mark} [the kind of broad-based left that, in the end, is the best bulwark against the far right]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Politics We Need Most of the planks of the left platform we need are already out there, waiting to be used to spur genuine debate and action across American society. Two in particular should top any left agenda. The first is universal health care: Medicare for All. The Republicans' haphazard bid to scrap the Affordable Care Act showed that even an extremely flawed version of "universal" coverage was still popular enough to scuttle repeal attempts. Now, according to recent polling, [public support for single-payer is on the rise]{.underline}. Even centrist Democrats like Kamala Harris are getting on board. [After decades of struggle, universal health care is, if not right around the corner, at least on the near horizon. Crucially, the demand for Medicare for All also offers a means to build the bonds of solidarity. As Atlantic writer Vann R. Newkirk recently pointed out, Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights activists saw universal health care as a critical component of their struggle for a just and equitable society.]{.underline} The same is true today. [Across movements --- whether for black lives or a fifteen-dollar minimum wage or immigrant rights --- universal health care is a demand that unifies]{.underline}. There's another reason to prioritize the push for universal health care. Far-right organizations like the Traditionalist Workers Party have begun making overtures to poor whites in places like Appalachia by talking about jobs and access to quality health care. We can't allow a pitch for decent health care, or an argument for good jobs, to be used as a gateway to fascism. Universal voting rights should be the second demand of any immediate left platform. Our political and economic system can't be changed, radically and in the long-term, through voting. But countless people are being hurt by the system as it exists today, and substantially boosting voter turnout is a prerequisite for winning the reforms that will improve their lives in the short term. Conservatives understand the importance of voting rights. In recent years, numerous GOP-controlled states have passed laws restricting the franchise, whether through ID requirements or shorter windows for voter registration. They know a smaller, demoralized voting base makes it harder to get left candidates into office. In the past, the Populist era of the 1890s came to a crashing halt in part because of Jim Crow laws and new state constitutions across the South that severely limited voting rights for African Americans (and many poor whites as well). On the flip side, the rise of a strong voting base in the urbanized North, which included union members and African Americans, propelled the New Deal forward and gave social democracy in America some of its earliest and most important victories --- despite opposition from both conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats. More recently, results at the local level have testified to the enduring power of a mobilized electorate. Victories by Chokwe Lumumba in Jackson, Mississippi's mayoral race and khalid kamau in South Fulton, Georgia's city council election were made possible by left-wing political activism on the ground. That these victories occurred in the Deep South and with heavy political participation from African Americans also belies common perceptions about what the Left looks like and where it can compete. Both Lumumba and kamau met people where they were at, while also sketching out an expansive vision. Which brings me to another important part of the Left's post-Charlottesville toolbox: political education. [[The debate]{.mark} over monuments and Confederate flags [is a perfect opportunity to get Americans thinking]{.mark} not just [about]{.mark} the world we live in, but [the kind of world we could live in if the Left was given the opportunity to lead.]{.mark}]{.underline} Beyond considering what statues to tear down, we should discuss what statues should replace them. Why not more monuments, across the country, to the United States Colored Troops or Harriet Tubman? But we should not stop with statues and public history, as important as they are to shaping future debates about the country's fate. [Political education should reach out to a wide range of Americans, both expanding their conception of what's possible and learning how they see the world]{.underline}. Left education, after all, should be a two-way street. It can take a variety of forms --- from setting up a booth at a community event or organizing a teach-in at a union hall to simply making sure socialist organizations are as open to the public as possible. Examples of political education, as I describe it, already exist. In my adopted home state of South Carolina, the SC Progressive Network offers a yearly "Modjeska Simkins School" to budding activists. Named after one of the state's greatest human rights advocates, the seminar teaches history as well as protest and activist tactics. It, and other education efforts like it across the nation, are the spiritual grandchildren of the Highlander Folk School in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Finally, mass protest against white supremacy will continue to be a crucial tactic going forward. The rally in Boston last month, where a handful of neo-Nazis were met with over thirty thousand counter-protesters, was an enormous victory for progressives and the Left. It demonstrated the power of solidarity, viscerally and publicly. But such actions must also be tied to the sorts of political programs and tactics pitched above --- using them as opportunities to not only bring together everyone opposed to white supremacy, but talking to people about the ways in which class warfare from above, gender and racial discrimination, and a revanchist politics hurts virtually everyone every day. We can't let facile narratives about "poor whites" drive the discourse on racism in American society. The white supremacists that marched in defense of the Robert E. Lee statue included many well-off, college-educated whites that would have no qualms throwing away the lives of poor white Americans. They would also destroy the lives and aspirations of African Americans, Jews, Latinos, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. [[By challenging these narratives and linking them to]{.mark} [concrete demands]{.mark} for a better future, [we can]{.mark} reach out to people who were [galvanize]{.mark}d by Charlottesville but might not know what can be done next. Breaking White Supremacy\'s Back These recommendations aren't politically sexy. They don't seem the stuff of revolution. But they're [the necessary materials for]{.mark} [improving political]{.mark} [conditions in the near future]{.mark} --- [which]{.mark} [has to be done before we can work for more transformative change]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Political education, for example, will be crucial for resuscitating the labor movement]{.underline}, to avoid more defeats like those suffered in union drives at Boeing's plant in Charleston, South Carolina or Nissan's plant in Canton, Mississippi. [A strong left expands the public sphere, offering a broader conception of what's politically attainable]{.underline}. It offers people a politics not of scapegoating or austerity but universal health care and democratic agency. Historically, [it's been the most potent antidote to the far right. But we must also remember that victory in street battles does not equal a durable political victory.]{.underline} Nor, on the other hand, is seeing a Democratic House in 2018 or a Democrat in the White House in 2020 the final measure of victory. The problems of Trump's America are, not surprisingly, much like the problems of Obama's America. And Bush's America. And Clinton's America. [[An effective left]{.mark} post-Charlottesville [will have to concern itself]{.mark}, as always, [with long-term planning]{.mark} and patient organizing]{.underline}. That's the only way we'll finally break the back of white identity politics --- the only identity politics to ever wield real political power in America.

#### The Panthers Prove Contingent legal change is necessary and doesn't trade off with revolutionary resistance

**Newton 80** \[Huey, Co-founder of the Black Panther Party for
Self-Defense, WAR AGAINST THE PANTHERS: A STUDY OF REPRESSION IN
AMERICA,[libcom.org/files/WATP.pdf](http://libcom.org/files/WATP.pdf)

2\. Use of Democratic Reforms by the Party to Build Community
Institutions [The[Panthers, despite]{.mark} their explicit [repudiation
of democratic cap]{.mark}italism as a system that was inherently
incapable of permitting Black and poor people from enjoying full and
equal participation in it, [did not eschew democratic]{.mark} means of
[reform]{.mark}, nor did they discourage Black capitalism. To
thecontrary, from its very inception, [the Party utilized]{.mark}
existing [legal machinery]{.mark} in order [to bring]{.mark} about
[social change and encouraged indigenous]{.mark} [Black]{.mark}
financial [enterprises]{.mark}. In addition to the legal police patrols
already mentioned, [the Party frequently filed civil law suits seeking
relief]{.mark} for its members, w and Black and poor people generally,
[from]{.mark} various [injustices]{.mark}.18 The[Panthers]{.mark} also
[turned to the ballot]{.mark} box, first by [running]{.mark} members
[for mayor and city council]{.mark} in Oakland in 1972 and 1974, and
comings surprisingly close to victory. In 1976, [Party involvement
was]{.mark} admittedly [credited by two successful Black candidates
for]{.mark} their [elections]{.mark}, to the offices of Mayor of Oakland
and Supervisor of Alameda County]{.underline}, the first two Black
persons to be elected to these positions in Oakland\'s history, despite
a sizeable Black population that had resided there since World War II.19
Moreover, the Party incorporated some of its main survival programs such
as its Intercommunal Youth Institute and Seniors Against a Fearful
Environment (SAFE). The Youth Institute, a school for more than one
hundred Party and other children from the first through the eighth
grades, was incorporated as the Educational Opportunities Corporation.20
SAFE was an escort and busing program in which young Blacks took seniors
out into the community---a combination of Black and gray power that to
some extent provides both groups what they need and desire---people
power. 21 The device of incorporation allowed both survival programs to
avail themselves of tax-deductible contributions and some limited
government benefits. The Party also advocated growth of indigenous
community businesses, even though they were capitalistic. This is
because the Party recognized that Black capitalism has come to mean to
many people Black control of another one of the institutions in t thee
community. This positive quality of Black capitalism should, the Party
felt, be encouraged. Since the people see Black capitalism in the
community as Black control of local institutions, this is a positive
characteristic because the people can bring more direction and focus to
the activities of the capitalist. At the same time, the Black capitalist
who has the interest of the community at heart will respond to the needs
of the people because this is where his true strength lies. So far as
capital \[in\] general is concerned, the black capitalist merely has the
status of a victim because the big capitalists have the skills, make the
loans„ and in fact control the Black capitalist. If he wants to succeed
in his enterprise, the Black capitalist must turn to the community
because he depends on them to make his profits. He needs this strong
community support because he cannot become independent of the control of
the corporate capitalists who control the large monopolies. The Black
capitalist will be able to support the people by contributing to the
survival programs of the Black Panther Party. In contributing to such
programs he will be able to help build the vehicle which will eventually
liberate the Black community. He will not be able to deliver the people
from their [problems, but he will be able to help build the strong
political machine which will serve as a revolutionary vanguard and guide
the people in their move toward freedom.22 [A practical application
of]{.mark} the [Party\'s view]{.mark} toward Black capitalism and [the
use of legal means of reform]{.mark}occurred]{.underline} in Oakland,
California, in 1971. A group of small Black-owned retail liquor stores
and taverns asked the BPP for support in a boycott against Mayfair
Supermarkets because Mayfair purchased alcoholic beverages from
companies that excluded Black truck drivers. The BPP joined in the
boycott, and within a period of days, Mayfair ended its discriminatory
practices. The Party then asked the group of Black businessmen who had
solicited Party help to make a nominal continuing contribution to one or
more survival programs. The businessmen, who had approached the Party
initially through an organization called the California State Package
Store and Tavern Owners Association (Cal-Pak), declined to contribute
except via a single gift. The Party rejected Cal-Pak\'s offer, stating,
. . . a continuing trickle of support is more important to the community
than a large, once-only hush mouth gift. We will not be paid off; we
will not be quiet. We will not go away. . . Why should the Black
community nourish a Black profiteer who has no concern for his
brother?23 [It [was]{.mark} considered [important to]{.mark}the Party\'s
concept of [building community institution]{.mark}s that contributions
from the Black businesses not only be continuing, but that they come
from the association representing them. This would, in the Party\'s
view, constitute participation through a united front and build Cal-Pak
as a community ins]{.underline}titution along with the survival
programs. Since the Party had been asked for assistance in the Mayfair
boycott by representatives of Cal-Pak, it also followed logically that
Cal-Pak should support the survival programs. When Cal-Pak refused, the
Party called for a boycott of the liquor stores of the president of
Cal-Pak, Bill Boyette, and picketed the two liquor stores he owned. Five
months later, Cal-Pak and the Party reached an agreement. Congressman
Ronald Dellums, who helped negotiate the settlement, announced at a
press conference in January 1972 that: . . . an agreement has been
reached of great importance to all of the people in the Bay Area and, in
particular, the Black population of this area. This agreement, between
the Black Panther Party and the Ad Hoc Committee for Promotion of Black
Business, officially ends the boycott of Boyette\'s Liquor Stores by the
Black Panther Party. . . The United Fund of the Bay Area, Inc.,
sponsored and created by the Ad Hoc Committee for the Promotion of Black
Business and the Cal-Pak Liquor Dealers, has already begun the task of
collecting funds from Black businesses and individuals for programs of
special need in the Black community. Operating as a nonprofit social
vehicle for the Black community, this new organization will make
disbursements to various significant organizations in the Black
community on a regular and continuing basis. Among the programs that
will benefit are the survival programs of the Black Panther Party.24
[This [willingness]{.mark} by the Party [to use]{.mark}democratic means
of [reform]{.mark} and to support Black capitalism [was
criticized]{.mark} by some[as inconsistent with]{.mark} the Panther
ideology of [revolution]{.mark}ary intercommunalism.]{.underline} This
is partly because progressive people *quite correctly observe* that \"It
is very clear, upon reflection, what function law serves within any
culture. It protects the culture\'s ideology. Under capitalism it
protects property, the men who own it and guard it.\"25 From this
observation, it is only a brief inferential step to the conclusion that,
because law is a product and perpetuator of corporate interests in this
country, it cannot be a force for significant socioeconomic change. [But
while [this]{.mark} conclusion is logical in a mechanistic-sense, it [is
illogical]{.mark}, and therefore wrong, in a dialectical sense:
According to the materialist conception of history, [theultimately
determining element in history is the production and reproduction of
real life\... \[I\]f somebody twists this]{.mark} into saying that the
economic element is the only determining one, [he transforms that
proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase]{.mark}. The
economic situation is basis, but the various elements of the
super-structure: political forms of the class struggle . . .
constitutions established by the victorious class . . . judicial forms,
had even the reflexes of all these actualstruggles in the brains of the
participants . . . also exercise their influence upon the course of the
historical struggles and in many cases preponderate in determining their
form.26 In sum, the [Panthers combined a unique blend of elements that
set them apart from traditional civil rights]{.mark} and
minorityorganizations: [a revolutionary ideology that argued for]{.mark}
the [necessity of fundamental]{.mark} socioeconomic [change]{.mark}, a
[practical]{.mark} series of survival [programs]{.mark} that served the
community and fostered institutional growth and consciousness,
[and]{.mark} a [willingness to employ creative legal means]{.mark}
with[in]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [democratic system to achieve their ends.
It was]{.mark} these [unique elements that made]{.mark} the [Panthers
popular with]{.mark} many [Blacks and]{.mark}, at the same time, [a
nemesis to the federal government]{.mark}.]{.underline}

###  Conflict vs Antagonism Extensions

#### A very crucial aspect of consensus building is that the process requires everyone\'s participation. Totalizing views of blackness wrecks potential for interracial coalition building. 

**McGary 97** Howard McGary Racism*, Social Justice, and Interracial
Coalitions* \[[Howard McGary is Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers, the
State University of New Jersey. ]{.mark}\]

**[Their emphasis on inclusion and dialogue]{.underline}**. If the first
step to a resolution is a clear understanding of African American
perceptions an atmosphere where these things can be examined in the
spirit of free and open inquiry**[. [The academy]{.mark} is not perfect,
but it [is]{.mark} still [one the best places to begin]{.mark} such an
inquiry. [African-American scholars]{.mark} have begun to [address this
exclusion and marginalization by working to bring the experiences of
African Americans into sharper focus and to the attention of the wider
communit]{.mark}y]{.underline}**. But in order for this effort to truly
bear fruit, African-American intellectuals must overcome the distrust
and suspicion that exists between African-American intellectuals and the
wider black community. West, in his \"Dilemma of the Black
Intellectual,\" attributes this dis trust and suspicion to the refusal
by many African-American intellectuals to remain, in some visible way,
linked with African-American cultural life.16 **[This [detachment
makes]{.mark} it [difficult for African-American intellec tuals to
articulate the concerns and values in African-American
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The other reason he cites is
the fact that American scholarship has placed African-American scholars
on the defensive. By this he means that African []{.mark}American
scholars spend an inordinate amount of time and energy respond ing to
the attack on the humanity of black people rather than on developing
creative ways to bridge the gap between African-American intellectuals
and the wider community. **[According to West, [white
intellectuals]{.mark} also [have a role to play in combating the
marginalization of African-American]{.mark} schol ars and African
Americans [in general]{.mark}. [They must address the failure by
mainstream scholarship]{.mark} to make the concerns of African Americans
[visible in intellectual discourses]{.mark}, especially [in]{.mark} the
pages of leading [journals that have as their charter the discussion
of]{.mark} cultural, [political,]{.mark} and moral
[issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, there are fewer
discussions of issues that directly related to the lived experience of
African Americans in scholarly journals today than there was thirty or
fourty years ago. **[Such a climate breeds separation and exclusion, and
works against the the kind of free and open dialogue that allows people
from different experiences to identify common concerns and values. But
[it is clearly not enough for whites or African Americans to be
inclusive when it comes to the intellectual contributions]{.mark} that
flow from various cultures. Intellectuals must join with the wider
community and resist the temptation]{.underline}** to acquiesce in
wrongdoing on the ground that they did not cause it. Decent people do
not cause or support known injustice, so they often take comfort in
viewing themselves as innocent bystanders. Although they condemn the
wrongdoing they did not cause, they feel no sense of responsibility when
it comes to ending or reducing its damaging effects. As I have argued
elsewhere[, **[to adopt such a posture is to shirk one\'s role as a
morally responsible person]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Not all of us **[have
the courage of alienation and exclusion, and if we cannot under stand
these perceptions without having a genuine dialogue, then we need and
wherewithal to fight injustice]{.underline}**, but we can disassociate
ourselves from injustice when there are reasonable avenues available for
doing so. Our disassociation shows that we do not condone the injustice
and signals to the perpetrators of injustice that we are not among their
ranks.17 Good faith efforts to **[disassociate from unjust practices
that we did not cause is an important first step in building the bonds
of trust that make coalitions possible]{.underline}**. Any realistic
proposal for ending the injustices or perceptions of injustice caused by
racism must be based upon creating trust and bonds of commitment across
races. **[[The creation of mechanisms that will allow for community is
something that must be forged through human interaction and struggle and
not discovered by appeal to impartial procedures or by engaging in
practices of exclusion.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Without a shared sense of
community there can be no justice, and without justice there can be no
peace. But how do we build the bonds of commitment and trust between
races that see themselves as different? Some philosophers and social
critics have aigued that we must eliminate the idea of racial
difference. According to this view, acknowledging or institutionalizing
racial differences serves to weaken or destroy bonds of commitment and
trust. For them the goal of the good or just society is racial
assimilation. **[By this they mean a society where a person\'s race is
morally, legally, and socially irrelevant. On their view, if we
eliminate racial differences, then there will not be a basis for racial
discrimination]{.underline}**.18 On the other hand, there are those who
oppose racial assimilation and argue that we should recognize
differences between races because fail ing to do so devalues those who
will be forced to embrace the culture and identity of the dominate and
powerful group through the process of racial assimilation. This position
is popularly known as cultural or racial pluralism. **[[The
cultural]{.mark} or racial pluralist r[ecognizes]{.mark} and
acknowledges [differences,]{.mark} [but insists that no culture or race
is superior]{.mark} to any other, [and]{.mark} that [all
cultures]{.mark} and races [have the right to exist in accordance with
the constraints of justice]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.19]{.mark} West
argues that **[interracial coalitions are crucial if we are to achieve
racial harmony and social justice]{.underline}**.20 **[But will
interracial coalitions allow us to build the bonds of commitment that
are necessary to achieve racial harmony and social justice? According to
West, [interracial coalitions are necessary, but not sufficient.
]{.mark}]{.underline}**[We also need redistribution of wealth, large
scale governmental intervention to assure access to basic social goods,
and courageous leadership]{.mark}. **[All of the ingredients of West\'s
proposed solution are sensible, but I am not sure how realistic they are
in today\'s climate. If what I argued above was sound, we cannot just
create a society that is in fact just if we want racial harmony or
peace]{.underline}**; we must create a society that is perceived as such
by its members, especially by racial minorities who are especially
sensitive to injustice. **[Even though West favors [interracial
coalitionary politics as opposed to any form of racial
separatism]{.mark}, he is well aware [that these coalitions are
difficult to maintain and]{.mark} they [require]{.mark} constant
[maintenance for their]{.mark} continued
[existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} West clearly recognizes that
**[good will is not enough]{.underline}**. But what is enough? Why will
these coalitions survive? Will they survive because different racial
groups depend upon each other to solve clearly identifiable common
problems that could not be solved without assistance from other groups?
**[What West has in mind here is coalitions like the coalition of
different racial groups in New Brunswick, New Jersey to fight for
affordable housing for poor people.]{.underline}** But if this is so,
will not these coalitions evaporate when the clearly identifiable
problem has been solved? Will we be able to use these coalitions to
tackle more long-ranging and intractable problems?

###  Black Radical Liberalism Extensions

#### 

#### The Movement for Black Lives proves Black radicalism can center around agenda setting policy work

**The Movement for Black Lives 16** \[The Movement for Black Lives, a
collective of more than 50 organizations representing thousands of Black
people from across the country, Platform of the Movement for Black
Lives, https://policy.m4bl.org/platform/AK47\]

Black humanity and dignity requires Black political will and power.
Despite constant exploitation and perpetual oppression, Black people
have bravely and brilliantly been the driving force pushing the U.S.
towards the ideals it articulates but has never achieved. In recent
years we have taken to the streets, launched massive campaigns, and
impacted elections, but **[our elected leaders have failed to address
the legitimate demands of our Movement. We can no longer
wait.]{.underline}** **[[In response to]{.mark} the sustained and
increasingly visible [violence against Black communities]{.mark} in the
U.S. and globally, a collective of more than 50 organizations
representing [thousands of Black people]{.mark} from across the country
[have come together]{.mark} with renewed energy and purpose [to
articulate a common]{.mark} vision and [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
We are a collective **[[that centers]{.mark} and is rooted in [Black
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but we recognize we have a shared
struggle with all oppressed people; collective liberation will be a
product of all of our work. **[We believe in elevating the experiences
and leadership of the most marginalized Black people, including but not
limited to]{.underline}** those who are **[women, queer, trans, femmes,
gender nonconforming, Muslim, formerly and currently incarcerated, cash
poor and working class, disabled, undocumented, and
immigrant.]{.underline}** We are intentional about amplifying the
particular experience of state and gendered violence that Black queer,
trans, gender nonconforming, women and intersex people face. There can
be no liberation for all Black people if we do not center and fight for
those who have been marginalized. It is our hope that by working
together to create and amplify a shared agenda, we can continue to move
towards a world in which the full humanity and dignity of all people is
recognized. While this platform is focused on domestic policies, we know
that patriarchy, exploitative capitalism, militarism, and white
supremacy know no borders. **[[We stand in solidarity with our
international family against the ravages of global capitalism and
anti-Black racism, human-made climate change, war, and
exploitation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** We also stand with descendants of
African people all over the world in an ongoing call and struggle for
reparations for the historic and continuing harms of colonialism and
slavery. We also recognize and honor the rights and struggle of our
Indigenous family for land and self-determination. We have created this
platform to articulate and support the ambitions and work of Black
people. **[We]{.underline}** also **[seek to intervene in the current
political climate and assert a clear vision]{.underline}**, particularly
for those who claim to be our allies, **[of the world we
want]{.underline}** them **[to]{.underline}** help us **[create. We
reject false solutions and believe we can achieve a complete
transformation of the current systems]{.underline}**, which place profit
over people and make it impossible for many of us to breathe. Together,
**[we demand an end to the wars against Black people. We demand that the
government repair the harms that have been done to Black
communities]{.underline}** in the form of reparations and targeted
long-term investments. We also demand a defunding of the systems and
institutions that criminalize and cage us. This document articulates our
vision of a fundamentally different world. However, **[[we]{.mark}
recognize the [need to include policies that address the immediate
suffering of Black people. These policies]{.mark}, while less
transformational, [are necessary to address the current material
conditions]{.mark} of our people [and]{.mark} will better [equip us to
win]{.mark} the world we demand and deserve.]{.underline}** We recognize
that **[not all of our collective needs and visions can be translated
into policy, but]{.underline}** we understand that **policy change is
one of many tactics necessary to move us towards the world we
envision.** We have come together now because we believe it is time to
forge a new covenant. We are dreamers and doers and this platform is
meant to articulate some of our vision. The links throughout the
document provide the stepping-stones and roadmaps of how to get there.
The policy briefs also elevate the brave and transformative work our
people are already engaged in, and build on some of the best thinking in
our history of struggle. This agenda continues the legacy of our
ancestors who pushed for reparations, Black self-determination and
community control; and also propels new iterations of movements such as
efforts for reproductive justice, holistic healing and reconciliation,
and ending violence against Black cis, queer, and trans people.

#  2NC -- Critical A-SPEC T

## 2NC ASPEC Ovw

#### The nexus question of this debate is which model of debate is best to produce topic-specific education, a fair playing field, and a model in which both the aff and neg can access the protest the affirmative claims to make. We argue that identifying the agent is critical to have an identifiable protest that is key to engaging with it outside of round and negating it inside of round. The aff must have a specific agent, but they only say we some people without specifying who is included in that definition. By not including the agent, there is no stable ground and they explode limits \-- The impacts are education and fairness. 

### Ground

#### Not specifying an agent kills core negative ground. Broad terms like "we some people" don't indicate anything about who is and isn't the agent, which prevents us from reading any sort of agent counterplan because the 2ac can inevitably make a perm shifting the advocacy to encompass the counterplan, or we decide to read a PIC the 2ac can reclarify the actor to spike out of the pics offense. This is a terrible framework for left v left debates because having nuanced debates about the strengths and weaknesses of certain agents in different movements is key to effective political strategizing. 

###  Limits

**The affirmative does not have to use the USFG as its agent, rather it
has to provide a specific movement or group of people that would
participate in the advocacy, this could be like the Black Panther Party,
Black Lives Matter, Jews for Justice in Palestine, etc. Identifying the
agent prevents the affirmative from shifting in the 2ac and 1ar because
shifting results in an infinite amount of agents that the negative can
never predict and thus never adjust to answer. An unspecified agent
means the aff explodes limits and means the negative is literally
expected to prepare for billions of agents - every person, animal,
political group, etc which isn't specified can be shifted to in the 2ac.
Exploding limits means the neg has an unfair research burden to meet and
disincentivizes deeper research. Identifying the agent is also better
for education on the aff because it means the affirmative has to
research specific movements which means that the aff accesses a deeper
understanding of the topic and protests of the topic - this is a link
turn because our model of debate provides for a better form of protest
in which the protest is identifiable and thus can produce structural
change in debate.**

#### Uniqueness: Black voters are key to the 2020 election

and its intersections. "New poll shows black voters want 2020 candidates
with big policy plans, not just big names"

**[[Black voters are expected to play a key role in the 2020 Democratic
primary, and in a large primary field, reaching these voters will be
important to any campaign that wants to stay
competitive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A new poll shows exactly what black
voters want and what candidates will need to do to reach them**[. A poll
released this week by BlackPAC, an organization that does election
polling and has led black voter engagement efforts in recent elections
in Virginia and Alabama, finds that more than halfway into the Trump
presidency, black voters are looking to push the country "back on
track." For registered black voters, this means supporting candidates
that will address racism and discrimination, as well as produce tangible
improvements in areas like health care, the economy, and police
accountability. BlackPAC's findings also note that the two candidates
with the most name recognition among black voters --- former Vice
President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders --- also enjoy the highest
favorability and greatest support among those polled. But BlackPAC
cautions that these standings could change as candidates release policy
plans and discuss how they plan to help black communities. "Name
identification, which is driving support for candidates at this point,
will be insufficient for decisively winning the Black electorate --- and
subsequently, securing the nomination,"]{.underline}** Adrianne
Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, said in a statement.
**["Candidates must use this critical window to define their campaigns
around these concerns." Black voters are especially concerned about
racism and discrimination --- and are looking for candidates with real
plans to address those issues]{.underline}** BlackPAC surveyed 613 black
registered voters, asking them to respond to online questions about the
issues they are concerned about, their opinions of specific candidates,
and how closely they are following the 2020 Democratic primary so far.
**[[The survey found that black voters are paying close attention to
politics]{.mark} in general [and]{.mark} the [2020]{.mark} race
specifically, with 84 percent of respondents saying that they are
following politics and the upcoming election; 92 percent of respondents
also said that they were likely going to vote in the 2020 presidential
election.]{.underline}** Among the BlackPAC survey respondents, **[[the
most likely voters in the survey were black voters in the 40-55 age
range]{.underline}]{.mark}** (94 percent of whom said they would vote)
[and the 56-64 age range]{.mark} (95 of whom said they would vote). Here
are some of the other key findings of the survey into black voters and
the 2020 election, according to a memo released by BlackPAC on Tuesday:
**[[One of the top issues for black voters, who responded with concern
and alarm about the direction of the country under Donald Trump, is
racism and discrimination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Name recognition is
currently driving favorable opinions for Democratic presidential
candidates. **[[Black voters \[are\] on high alert, and are paying close
attention to political developments]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

From Vietnam through Iraq**[, [African Americans have proved to be the
group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**." The October 4, 2016, issue of
**[the New York Times]{.underline}**, which contained the article,
"Syrian War Magnifies Tension in America's Global Mission," is a case
study in white supremacy. The article is framed from a totally white
"conservative" and "liberal" frame, and **[completely ignores the
perspective of [African Americans]{.mark}, who, [traditionally, and
today, are consistently and overwhelmingly,
anti-imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.mark} **[who [tend to
identify with other Black and Brown people across the globe, including
the Palestinians]{.mark} and Syrians]{.underline}**. The article
purports to give "both sides" of the argument for U.S. intervention in
the affairs of sovereign nations. The authors of the article give the
impression that they are being "balanced" in giving the views of those
who support America's "mission" in the world and those who are
"critical" of said "mission." This false "balance" does not include the
perspectives of any African American historians or critics of U.S.
foreign policy, like Professor Gerald Horne, Bill Fletcher, Anthony
Monteiro, Glen Ford or African (American) scholars like Horace Campbell.
In fact, "both sides" of any debate in the U.S. regarding foreign
policy, are both white "sides." This is particularly true when it comes
to U.S. foreign policy, where whites are the only ones who are presumed
to either have an opinion on such issues, or one that is worth
mentioning. It is true that "both sides" could include Blacks who adhere
to the Eurocentric, party-line views of the dominant U.S. narrators,
say, Donna Brazile or Condoleezza Rice, or Blacks on the so-called
"left," but their views (still missing from this piece) are not a Black
critique. It is a Eurocentric critique coming from a Black person, which
is fundamentally different than an African American critique viewed
through the lens of the African American experience. The ideas, views
and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of
the Times when it comes to foreign policy \-- which proves that the
writers, the editorial staff and the paper itself does not consider
those views important. And in ignoring those critiques, it also ignores
the historical critical analysis of the people who are and have been the
subjects of U.S. foreign policy. "[The ideas, views and critiques of
Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it
comes to foreign policy]{.underline}." It also completely ignores **[the
analysis of great Black historical thinkers like W.E.B. DuBois, Walter
Rodney and Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, the late stage Martin Luther King,
Jr., as well as the organizations they represented such as the Council
on African Affairs (the CAA), the NAACP of the 1940's, the African
Liberation Support Committee, the Black Panther Party, The African Blood
Brotherhood, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, Trans Africa, the
U.S. Human Rights Network, the United Negro Improvement Association or
the National Council of Black Lawyers, all of whom were deeply critical
of America's so-called mission in the world, especially as it related to
African and Asian peoples, like Haitians, Congolese, Syrians, Yemenis
and Palestinians]{.underline}**. The critiques of these people are
irrelevant to, not only the Times, but in truth, to the Democratic and
Republican parties, the current incarnation of the NAACP, the Black
Congressional Caucus, President Obama and most white liberal formations.
However, this is not a reason to give the Times a pass. Even the use of
the word "mission," with the European habit of sending missionaries into
Africa and the Americas to soften the people up with European religion
before they were subdued by hard power, does not elicit irony on the
part of the Times. The "white man's burden" of "civilizing" the darker
races of the world, through enslavement, destroying their religions,
cultures, languages, colonizing their lands and resource and extracting
their people and whisking them away to foreign lands to toil from birth
to death for free, is just as important and essential a part of the
history of "America's Global Mission" as anything else mentioned in the
piece. The hand wringing of the mostly white imperialists on the "left"
and on the right, regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism, is
essentially what the piece presents. No other perspectives or voices are
important or valid. Thus the perspectives of African American thinkers
are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns "black" issues
like police brutality, but not on international issues, although many
black writers and thinkers would argue the two are connected. This is so
even though the very presence people of African descent in America is a
direct result of the United States' foreign policy of capturing,
importing and enslaving African people. This point is lost on white
foreign policy writers. However, [early Black thinkers were clear on
this point. People like DuBois and Robeson, in the past, and
contemporaries like Glen Ford, were/are, fiercely
anti-imperialist]{.underline}. "The perspectives of African American
thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns
'black' issues like police brutality, but not on international issues."
The white, imperialist presentation in the article excludes the ideas of
Syrian Americans, Indigenous populations, Mexican and Puerto Rican
Americans and Hawaiians, all of whom may have a totally different idea
of America's "obligation" in Syria. Penny M. Von Eschen notes in the
book, Race Against Empire, Black Americans and Anticolonialism
1937-1957, that "Objecting to U.S. support for South African and the
European colonial powers, and increasingly challenging the notion that
America was the legitimate leader of the 'free world' and therefore
above censure, black Americans both criticized new directions in
American foreign policy and attempted to use the United Nations as a
forum in which to gain support for civil rights struggles in the United
States." **[African Americans are no less critical of America's
self-serving "mission" today as was then.]{.underline}** African
Americans were highly critical of the U.S.'s violent overthrow of the
African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60's and
Venezuela in the Chavez era and today. We have not forgotten America's
refusal to recognize Haiti as an independent Black nation when it
defeated the French. Nor are we unmindful of the U.S. invasion of Haiti
in 1915 and its support of dictators of the Duvalier family, the coup of
the Aristide government and the fact that President Obama tried to
prevent Aristide from returning to Haiti. [Black thinkers on
international issues are highly supportive of the Palestinian cause and
troubled by the continued expansion of AFRICOM, the U.S. Africa Command,
on the continent.]{.underline} This analysis is glaringly absent from
mainstream media portrayals of America's "duty" in the world. The Times
article offers the view that, "Because many Americans see their foreign
policy as a grand mission to make the world a better place, they tend to
divide the world into heroes who support their ideals and villains who
oppose them." But which Americans are the writers talking about and
whose "ideals" are represented in U.S. foreign policy. It is certain
that the views of people like George Padmore, a leader in the
Pan-African movement in the 40's and 50's, are not represented by this
view. Padmore was clear that, "Empire and peace are incompatible[."
Michael C. Dawson notes, in Blacks in and Out of the Left: "from Vietnam
through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans
most opposed to U.S. military intervention." It is also purposely
"forgotten" that the Black Panther Party was, following in the footsteps
of their ideological predecessor, Malcolm X, staunchly
anti-imperialist]{.underline}. As Eldridge Cleaver noted, the U.S. was
"bankrolling and arming all of the oppressive regimes around the world."
One of the agenda items contained in the National Black Political
Agenda, created in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 called for an end to the
Vietnam War and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and
Africa; the withdrawal of U.S. military, corporations, and
communications facilities from southern Africa and the Third World;
self-determination of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; an end to
sanctions against Cuba and the closure of the American military base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "African Americans were highly critical of the
U.S.'s violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions
toward Cuba in the 60's and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today."
Contemporary white American analysis of U.S. foreign excludes the
historical reality that, in thinking of America's support of so-called
rebels in Syria and Libya, it is clear to African Americans that America
never supported a single African liberation group in Africa. It is not
lost on Black Americans that the African National Congress and Nelson
Mandela were considered terrorists by the U.S. No African rebel movement
seeking independence from the Dutch, British, French, German, Portuguese
or Italian colonizers of African lands ever received a single drop of
military support from Washington. The U.S. never supported the Mau Mau
in Kenya, nor Frelimo in Mozambique, nor the ANC in South Africa, or any
other revolutionary movement on the continent. In fact, the contrary is
true. From the coup against Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to the assassination
of Patrice Lumuumba in the Congo, to the capture of Nelson Mandela and
to the support the racist apartheid system of South African and the
murderous colonial regime in the former Rhodesia, the American
government has consistently and forcefully opposed revolutionary
movements in Africa and in fact supported their colonial oppressors. The
only country to ever militarily support African liberation was Cuba, not
the U.S. Regarding Mandela, (who the U.S. considered a terrorist) we
heard him clearly when, in response to a request to condemn Fidel
Castro, Yassar Arafat and Mommar Ghadifi, he said, your enemies are not
necessarily our enemies. Indeed, not only did Castro send troops to aid
the Angolans in defeating the South Africans, he also provided refuge
for many African American freedom fighters, from Robert Williams to
Assata Shakur. While the U.S. was infiltrating, surveilling and
murdering Black political activists in the Black Panther Party, leaders
of North Vietnam, China, Algeria and Cuba welcomed them as ambassadors
of the African American community. ["It is clear to African Americans
that America never supported a single African liberation group."
Understanding this historical reality, Black thinkers are justifiably
critical and suspicious of U.S. intentions in places like Iraq, Iran,
Syria and Libya. The greatest thinkers in African American culture
explicitly made the connection between the U.S. and European colonialism
abroad, in places like Syria, as an extension of the domestic policy of
treating African Americans as second class citizens -- or, as some
African American thinkers have argued, the domestic colonization of
Black people.]{.underline} The genocide of the Native Americans
resonates with Black Americans. Leaders from MLK, who connected
America's imperialism in Vietnam, and the tax dollars used to support
it, to the lack of financial resources available to be used to build
cities and provide a basic wage; to Malcolm, who traveled the globe
making personal connections with African heads of state, including
Nasser in Egypt. It was Malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the
Bandung Conference, where 29 Asian and African, post-colonial nations,
met to discuss their own fates independent of colonial powers, including
the U.S. Black American support for anti-imperialist movements did not
find a space in the Times' analysis of Syria. The writers and editorial
staff at the Times are oblivious to the histories of the Third World
peoples living in their midst. Therefore, for Black people who
understand this history, they recognize articles like the one published
in the Times as imperial propaganda pieces for global white supremacy.
Yet, the Times, in that regard, is no different than any other white
American newspaper, magazine or news program or politician. They all
(even, or especially, the Black ones) present a Eurocentric worldview
that excludes the ideas, histories and analysis of its black population.
We are irrelevant. We serve the function we have always served: subjects
of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign
policy. Blacks can nominally participate in the American experience, but
only so long as we stay in our place and as long as we support the
"manifest destiny" of the global hegemon and not get in its way. We are
cannon fodder for the imperialist wars abroad and casualties in the U.S.
war on drugs and on poor Black life at home. "Malcolm traveled the globe
making personal connections with African heads of state, including
Nasser in Egypt." The presence of a black face at the head of the empire
has provided cover for U.S. imperialism in Africa and Asia, but it has
not diminished the anti-imperialism of the black community. It has
silenced the voices of the self-appointed black "leaders" and revealed
them to be supporters of empire and oppression. The Times, too, or
rather again, reveals itself as a supporter of the Pentagon by
publishing an article that is short on true analysis of America's
support of terrorists in Syria, as well as presenting a limited, white
supremacist parameter of debate. [Although the African American
tradition of anti-imperialism may not be important to the Times, it is a
tradition that is still alive nonetheless. And neither the Black face of
the empire, nor the white press in service to it, can diminish it. Our
antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized in the pages of the
Times, but it lives on in our continued support for amnesty for Assata
Shakur, the release of all political prisoners from Leonard Peltier to
Jalil Muntiquim and Oscar Rivera Lopez, to support for Palestinian
self-determination, to opposition to the re-colonization of Africa by
America's Africa Command, to the growing support by Black athletes,
young and old, of Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the National
Anthem, to our opposition to all U.S. wars of aggression, including the
ones in Libya and Syria. African Americans' opposition to the U.S.
supported aggression in Syria, masquerading as humanitarian support, is
obviously irrelevant to the Times, but Malcolm X told us plainly years
ago, that the media would have us thinking the good guy was the bad guy
and vice versa.]{.underline} So whether, or even if, Assad is a
"ruthless dictator," the term the U.S. has used against everyone from
Castro to Chavez, it does not therefore mean that African Americans
agree that the U.S. has the right to support insurrection in Syria. We
know imperialism is Euro-American, white, capitalist venture that is
carried against "the darker nations," not for them. Malcolm, Martin and
Mandela taught us well.

https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/charlottesville-antifa-trump-medicare-for-all

The events in Charlottesville have remained in the headlines for the
last few weeks for a variety of reasons. Surprise at the audacity of a
torch-light procession of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, and
"alt-rightists" in an American city, coupled with the murder of social
justice activist Heather Heyer during a counterdemonstration, fueled the
initial coverage. President Trump's abhorrent response to the tragedy
and local struggles against Confederate statues kept it alive. And
frequently dimwitted debates about the merits of antifa have supplied
yet more conversational oxygen. But it would be a mistake for the
American left to see this as a decisive turning point in history, or
mistake torch-wielding fascists for a mass force. On the contrary:
getting consumed by debates about supporting antifa in its street
clashes with neo-Nazis misses the larger political landscape. [[The
post-Charlottesville moment does demand **antiracist
mobilizations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it's heartening that left
organizations have sprung into action and seen their numbers swell.
Standing up to the far right --- particularly when done effectively and
en masse, like in Boston --- can energize people who are otherwise
frustrated and disenchanted because of the Trump administration.
[[But]{.mark} that [needs]{.mark} to be linked to [tangible]{.mark}
political [organizing]{.mark} [that]{.mark} **[goes beyond the]{.mark}
[defensive]{.mark} or [symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Discussions
about antifa are also important. Interviews with counter-protestors on
the ground in Charlottesville made it clear they were more than happy
antifa was there to help. In fact, Cornel West credited them with saving
his life. But the debate over antifa cannot be at the center of left
political discussion. [[I am less concerned about]{.mark} being murdered
by [a neo-Nazi than]{.mark} I am about the **[lack of]{.mark} [access to
quality]{.mark} [health care]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I am more exercised
about the suppression of voting rights and the damage it does to
democracy in the here and now than the damage simply represented by
Confederate statues. This is not to dismiss the efforts to tear down
Confederate statutes. What lies in the public commons, after all, needs
to represent the kind of country we want the United States to be. But we
shouldn't allow the conflagration to cloud our vision. In short, the
lessons post-Charlottesville are the lessons we should have learned
earlier this year. [[We cannot simply react to Trump]{.mark} or the
"alt-right." **Being proactive**, **[advancing a]{.mark} clear
[program]{.mark}** [that can mobilize]{.mark} and galvanize a huge swath
of [the public]{.mark} --- this [must be the hallmark]{.mark} of the
American left. [Otherwise]{.mark}, the genuine **[anger]{.mark} directed
[at Trump]{.mark} and the GOP [will be wasted.]{.mark}** And [we'll
**squander our chance** to build the kind of broad-based left that, in
the end, is the best bulwark against the far
right]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Politics We Need Most of the
planks of the left platform we need are already out there, waiting to be
used to spur genuine debate and action across American society. Two in
particular should top any left agenda. The first is universal health
care: Medicare for All. The Republicans' haphazard bid to scrap the
Affordable Care Act showed that even an extremely flawed version of
"universal" coverage was still popular enough to scuttle repeal
attempts. Now, according to recent polling, [public support for
**single-payer** is on the rise]{.underline}. Even centrist Democrats
like Kamala Harris are getting on board. [After **decades of struggle**,
universal health care is, if not right around the corner, at least on
the near horizon. Crucially, **the demand for Medicare for All also
offers a means to build the bonds of solidarity**. As Atlantic writer
Vann R. Newkirk recently pointed out, Martin Luther King Jr and other
**civil rights activists** saw universal health care as **a critical
component** of their struggle for a just and equitable
society.]{.underline} The same is true today. [Across movements ---
whether for **black lives** or a **fifteen-dollar minimum wage** or
**immigrant rights** --- universal health care is a demand that
unifies]{.underline}. There's another reason to prioritize the push for
universal health care. Far-right organizations like the Traditionalist
Workers Party have begun making overtures to poor whites in places like
Appalachia by talking about jobs and access to quality health care. We
can't allow a pitch for decent health care, or an argument for good
jobs, to be used as a gateway to fascism. Universal voting rights should
be the second demand of any immediate left platform. Our political and
economic system can't be changed, radically and in the long-term,
through voting. But countless people are being hurt by the system as it
exists today, and substantially boosting voter turnout is a prerequisite
for winning the reforms that will improve their lives in the short term.
Conservatives understand the importance of voting rights. In recent
years, numerous GOP-controlled states have passed laws restricting the
franchise, whether through ID requirements or shorter windows for voter
registration. They know a smaller, demoralized voting base makes it
harder to get left candidates into office. In the past, the Populist era
of the 1890s came to a crashing halt in part because of Jim Crow laws
and new state constitutions across the South that severely limited
voting rights for African Americans (and many poor whites as well). On
the flip side, the rise of a strong voting base in the urbanized North,
which included union members and African Americans, propelled the New
Deal forward and gave social democracy in America some of its earliest
and most important victories --- despite opposition from both
conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats. More recently, results
at the local level have testified to the enduring power of a mobilized
electorate. Victories by Chokwe Lumumba in Jackson, Mississippi's
mayoral race and khalid kamau in South Fulton, Georgia's city council
election were made possible by left-wing political activism on the
ground. That these victories occurred in the Deep South and with heavy
political participation from African Americans also belies common
perceptions about what the Left looks like and where it can compete.
Both Lumumba and kamau met people where they were at, while also
sketching out an expansive vision. Which brings me to another important
part of the Left's post-Charlottesville toolbox: political education.
[**[The debate]{.mark}** over monuments and Confederate flags [is a
perfect opportunity to get Americans thinking]{.mark} **not just
[about]{.mark} the world we live in, but [the kind of world we could
live in if the Left was given the opportunity to
lead.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Beyond considering what statues to tear
down, we should discuss what statues should replace them. Why not more
monuments, across the country, to the United States Colored Troops or
Harriet Tubman? But we should not stop with statues and public history,
as important as they are to shaping future debates about the country's
fate. [**[Political education]{.mark}** [should]{.mark} reach out to a
wide range of Americans, both **[expand]{.mark}ing their [conception of
what's possible]{.mark}** and learning how they see the
world]{.underline}. Left education, after all, should be a two-way
street. It can take a variety of forms --- from setting up a booth at a
community event or organizing a teach-in at a union hall to simply
making sure socialist organizations are as open to the public as
possible. Examples of political education, as I describe it, already
exist. In my adopted home state of South Carolina, the SC Progressive
Network offers a yearly "Modjeska Simkins School" to budding activists.
Named after one of the state's greatest human rights advocates, the
seminar teaches history as well as protest and activist tactics. It, and
other education efforts like it across the nation, are the spiritual
grandchildren of the Highlander Folk School in the 1930s, '40s, and
'50s. Finally, mass protest against white supremacy will continue to be
a crucial tactic going forward. The rally in Boston last month, where a
handful of neo-Nazis were met with over thirty thousand
counter-protesters, was an enormous victory for progressives and the
Left. It demonstrated the power of solidarity, viscerally and publicly.
But such actions must also be tied to the sorts of political programs
and tactics pitched above --- using them as opportunities to not only
bring together everyone opposed to white supremacy, but talking to
people about the ways in which class warfare from above, gender and
racial discrimination, and a revanchist politics hurts virtually
everyone every day. We can't let facile narratives about "poor whites"
drive the discourse on racism in American society. The white
supremacists that marched in defense of the Robert E. Lee statue
included many well-off, college-educated whites that would have no
qualms throwing away the lives of poor white Americans. They would also
destroy the lives and aspirations of African Americans, Jews, Latinos,
immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. [[By challenging these narratives
and linking them to]{.mark} **[concrete demands]{.mark}** for a better
future, [we can]{.mark} [reach out to people who]{.mark} were galvanized
by Charlottesville but [might not know what can be done next]{.mark}.
Breaking White Supremacy\'s Back [These recommendations aren't
politically sexy. They don't seem the stuff of revolution. But they're
the **necessary materials for**]{.mark} **[improving political]{.mark}
[conditions in the near future]{.mark} --- [which]{.mark} [has to be
done before we can work for more transformative
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Political
education]{.underline}]{.mark}[, for example, [will be crucial]{.mark}
for resuscitating the labor movement]{.underline}, to avoid more defeats
like those suffered in union drives at Boeing's plant in Charleston,
South Carolina or Nissan's plant in Canton, Mississippi. [[A strong left
**expands the public sphere**, offering a broader conception of what's
politically attainable]{.underline}]{.mark}. It offers people a politics
not of scapegoating or austerity but universal health care and
democratic agency. Historically, **[[it's been the most potent antidote
to the far right]{.mark}. [But we must also remember that victory in
street battles does not equal a durable political
victory.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Nor, on the other hand, is seeing a
Democratic House in 2018 or a Democrat in the White House in 2020 the
final measure of victory. The problems of Trump's America are, not
surprisingly, much like the problems of Obama's America. And Bush's
America. And Clinton's America. [[An effective left]{.mark}
post-Charlottesville [will have to concern itself]{.mark}, as always,
[with **long-term planning**]{.mark} and patient
organizing]{.underline}. That's the only way we'll finally break the
back of white identity politics --- the only identity politics to ever
wield real political power in America.

Democrats who have launched campaigns in the 2020 election showed up to
the civil rights organization's annual conference this week in a
Sheraton hotel ballroom in Manhattan's Times Square. Eight of those
candidates gave speeches on Friday -- including Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio,
who had just announced his campaign a day earlier -- touching on a range
of issues including taxes, child care and climate change. But the
predominant themes of their remarks mirrored the NAN's own

himself, also affirmed their support for a bill introduced in Congress
that would create a commission to study reparations for
African-Americans. "When I am elected president, I will sign that bill,"
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told Sharpton to raucous applause from the

#### Uniqueness: Black voters are key to the 2020 election

and its intersections. "New poll shows black voters want 2020 candidates
with big policy plans, not just big names"

**[[Black voters are expected to play a key role in the 2020 Democratic
primary, and in a large primary field, reaching these voters will be
important to any campaign that wants to stay
competitive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A new poll shows exactly what black
voters want and what candidates will need to do to reach them**[. A poll
released this week by BlackPAC, an organization that does election
polling and has led black voter engagement efforts in recent elections
in Virginia and Alabama, finds that more than halfway into the Trump
presidency, black voters are looking to push the country "back on
track." For registered black voters, this means supporting candidates
that will address racism and discrimination, as well as produce tangible
improvements in areas like health care, the economy, and police
accountability. BlackPAC's findings also note that the two candidates
with the most name recognition among black voters --- former Vice
President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders --- also enjoy the highest
favorability and greatest support among those polled. But BlackPAC
cautions that these standings could change as candidates release policy
plans and discuss how they plan to help black communities. "Name
identification, which is driving support for candidates at this point,
will be insufficient for decisively winning the Black electorate --- and
subsequently, securing the nomination,"]{.underline}** Adrianne
Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, said in a statement.
**["Candidates must use this critical window to define their campaigns
around these concerns." Black voters are especially concerned about
racism and discrimination --- and are looking for candidates with real
plans to address those issues]{.underline}** BlackPAC surveyed 613 black
registered voters, asking them to respond to online questions about the
issues they are concerned about, their opinions of specific candidates,
and how closely they are following the 2020 Democratic primary so far.
**[[The survey found that black voters are paying close attention to
politics]{.mark} in general [and]{.mark} the [2020]{.mark} race
specifically, with 84 percent of respondents saying that they are
following politics and the upcoming election; 92 percent of respondents
also said that they were likely going to vote in the 2020 presidential
election.]{.underline}** Among the BlackPAC survey respondents, **[[the
most likely voters in the survey were black voters in the 40-55 age
range]{.underline}]{.mark}** (94 percent of whom said they would vote)
[and the 56-64 age range]{.mark} (95 of whom said they would vote). Here
are some of the other key findings of the survey into black voters and
the 2020 election, according to a memo released by BlackPAC on Tuesday:
**[[One of the top issues for black voters, who responded with concern
and alarm about the direction of the country under Donald Trump, is
racism and discrimination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Name recognition is
currently driving favorable opinions for Democratic presidential
candidates. **[[Black voters \[are\] on high alert, and are paying close
attention to political developments]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

From Vietnam through Iraq**[, [African Americans have proved to be the
group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**." The October 4, 2016, issue of
**[the New York Times]{.underline}**, which contained the article,
"Syrian War Magnifies Tension in America's Global Mission," is a case
study in white supremacy. The article is framed from a totally white
"conservative" and "liberal" frame, and **[completely ignores the
perspective of [African Americans]{.mark}, who, [traditionally, and
today, are consistently and overwhelmingly,
anti-imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.mark} **[who [tend to
identify with other Black and Brown people across the globe, including
the Palestinians]{.mark} and Syrians]{.underline}**. The article
purports to give "both sides" of the argument for U.S. intervention in
the affairs of sovereign nations. The authors of the article give the
impression that they are being "balanced" in giving the views of those
who support America's "mission" in the world and those who are
"critical" of said "mission." This false "balance" does not include the
perspectives of any African American historians or critics of U.S.
foreign policy, like Professor Gerald Horne, Bill Fletcher, Anthony
Monteiro, Glen Ford or African (American) scholars like Horace Campbell.
In fact, "both sides" of any debate in the U.S. regarding foreign
policy, are both white "sides." This is particularly true when it comes
to U.S. foreign policy, where whites are the only ones who are presumed
to either have an opinion on such issues, or one that is worth
mentioning. It is true that "both sides" could include Blacks who adhere
to the Eurocentric, party-line views of the dominant U.S. narrators,
say, Donna Brazile or Condoleezza Rice, or Blacks on the so-called
"left," but their views (still missing from this piece) are not a Black
critique. It is a Eurocentric critique coming from a Black person, which
is fundamentally different than an African American critique viewed
through the lens of the African American experience. The ideas, views
and critiques of Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of
the Times when it comes to foreign policy \-- which proves that the
writers, the editorial staff and the paper itself does not consider
those views important. And in ignoring those critiques, it also ignores
the historical critical analysis of the people who are and have been the
subjects of U.S. foreign policy. "[The ideas, views and critiques of
Black thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it
comes to foreign policy]{.underline}." It also completely ignores **[the
analysis of great Black historical thinkers like W.E.B. DuBois, Walter
Rodney and Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, the late stage Martin Luther King,
Jr., as well as the organizations they represented such as the Council
on African Affairs (the CAA), the NAACP of the 1940's, the African
Liberation Support Committee, the Black Panther Party, The African Blood
Brotherhood, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, Trans Africa, the
U.S. Human Rights Network, the United Negro Improvement Association or
the National Council of Black Lawyers, all of whom were deeply critical
of America's so-called mission in the world, especially as it related to
African and Asian peoples, like Haitians, Congolese, Syrians, Yemenis
and Palestinians]{.underline}**. The critiques of these people are
irrelevant to, not only the Times, but in truth, to the Democratic and
Republican parties, the current incarnation of the NAACP, the Black
Congressional Caucus, President Obama and most white liberal formations.
However, this is not a reason to give the Times a pass. Even the use of
the word "mission," with the European habit of sending missionaries into
Africa and the Americas to soften the people up with European religion
before they were subdued by hard power, does not elicit irony on the
part of the Times. The "white man's burden" of "civilizing" the darker
races of the world, through enslavement, destroying their religions,
cultures, languages, colonizing their lands and resource and extracting
their people and whisking them away to foreign lands to toil from birth
to death for free, is just as important and essential a part of the
history of "America's Global Mission" as anything else mentioned in the
piece. The hand wringing of the mostly white imperialists on the "left"
and on the right, regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism, is
essentially what the piece presents. No other perspectives or voices are
important or valid. Thus the perspectives of African American thinkers
are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns "black" issues
like police brutality, but not on international issues, although many
black writers and thinkers would argue the two are connected. This is so
even though the very presence people of African descent in America is a
direct result of the United States' foreign policy of capturing,
importing and enslaving African people. This point is lost on white
foreign policy writers. However, [early Black thinkers were clear on
this point. People like DuBois and Robeson, in the past, and
contemporaries like Glen Ford, were/are, fiercely
anti-imperialist]{.underline}. "The perspectives of African American
thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns
'black' issues like police brutality, but not on international issues."
The white, imperialist presentation in the article excludes the ideas of
Syrian Americans, Indigenous populations, Mexican and Puerto Rican
Americans and Hawaiians, all of whom may have a totally different idea
of America's "obligation" in Syria. Penny M. Von Eschen notes in the
book, Race Against Empire, Black Americans and Anticolonialism
1937-1957, that "Objecting to U.S. support for South African and the
European colonial powers, and increasingly challenging the notion that
America was the legitimate leader of the 'free world' and therefore
above censure, black Americans both criticized new directions in
American foreign policy and attempted to use the United Nations as a
forum in which to gain support for civil rights struggles in the United
States." **[African Americans are no less critical of America's
self-serving "mission" today as was then.]{.underline}** African
Americans were highly critical of the U.S.'s violent overthrow of the
African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60's and
Venezuela in the Chavez era and today. We have not forgotten America's
refusal to recognize Haiti as an independent Black nation when it
defeated the French. Nor are we unmindful of the U.S. invasion of Haiti
in 1915 and its support of dictators of the Duvalier family, the coup of
the Aristide government and the fact that President Obama tried to
prevent Aristide from returning to Haiti. [[Black thinkers on
international issues are highly supportive of the Palestinian
cause]{.mark} and troubled by the continued expansion of AFRICOM, the
U.S. Africa Command, on the continent.]{.underline} This analysis is
glaringly absent from mainstream media portrayals of America's "duty" in
the world. The Times article offers the view that, "Because many
Americans see their foreign policy as a grand mission to make the world
a better place, they tend to divide the world into heroes who support
their ideals and villains who oppose them." But which Americans are the
writers talking about and whose "ideals" are represented in U.S. foreign
policy. It is certain that the views of people like George Padmore, a
leader in the Pan-African movement in the 40's and 50's, are not
represented by this view. Padmore was clear that, "Empire and peace are
incompatible[." Michael C. Dawson notes, in Blacks in and Out of the
Left: "from Vietnam through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be
the group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military intervention." It
is also purposely "forgotten" that [the Black Panther Party was,
following in the footsteps of their ideological predecessor, Malcolm X,
staunchly anti-imperialist]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[As Eldridge Cleaver
noted, the U.S. was "bankrolling and arming all of the oppressive
regimes around the world."]{.underline}]{.mark}** One of the agenda
items contained in the National Black Political Agenda, created in Gary,
Indiana, in 1972 called for an end to the Vietnam War and the immediate
withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and Africa; the withdrawal of
U.S. military, corporations, and communications facilities from southern
Africa and the Third World; self-determination of Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands; an end to sanctions against Cuba and the closure of the
American military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "African Americans were
highly critical of the U.S.'s violent overthrow of the African nation of
Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60's and Venezuela in the
Chavez era and today." Contemporary white American analysis of U.S.
foreign excludes the historical reality that, in thinking of America's
support of so-called rebels in Syria and Libya, it is clear to African
Americans that America never supported a single African liberation group
in Africa. It is not lost on Black Americans that the African National
Congress and Nelson Mandela were considered terrorists by the U.S. No
African rebel movement seeking independence from the Dutch, British,
French, German, Portuguese or Italian colonizers of African lands ever
received a single drop of military support from Washington. The U.S.
never supported the Mau Mau in Kenya, nor Frelimo in Mozambique, nor the
ANC in South Africa, or any other revolutionary movement on the
continent. In fact, the contrary is true. From the coup against Kwame
Nkrumah in Ghana to the assassination of Patrice Lumuumba in the Congo,
to the capture of Nelson Mandela and to the support the racist apartheid
system of South African and the murderous colonial regime in the former
Rhodesia, the American government has consistently and forcefully
opposed revolutionary movements in Africa and in fact supported their
colonial oppressors. The only country to ever militarily support African
liberation was Cuba, not the U.S. Regarding Mandela, (who the U.S.
considered a terrorist) we heard him clearly when, in response to a
request to condemn Fidel Castro, Yassar Arafat and Mommar Ghadifi, he
said, your enemies are not necessarily our enemies. Indeed, not only did
Castro send troops to aid the Angolans in defeating the South Africans,
he also provided refuge for many African American freedom fighters, from
Robert Williams to Assata Shakur. While the U.S. was infiltrating,
surveilling and murdering Black political activists in the Black Panther
Party, leaders of North Vietnam, China, Algeria and Cuba welcomed them
as ambassadors of the African American community. ["[It is clear to
African Americans that America never supported a single African
liberation group." Understanding this historical reality, Black thinkers
are justifiably critical and suspicious of U.S. intentions]{.mark} in
places like Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya. The greatest thinkers in
African American culture explicitly made the connection between the U.S.
and European colonialism abroad, in places like Syria, as an extension
of the domestic policy of treating African Americans as second class
citizens -- or, as some African American thinkers have argued, the
domestic colonization of Black people.]{.underline} The genocide of the
Native Americans resonates with Black Americans. Leaders from MLK, who
connected America's imperialism in Vietnam, and the tax dollars used to
support it, to the lack of financial resources available to be used to
build cities and provide a basic wage; to Malcolm, who traveled the
globe making personal connections with African heads of state, including
Nasser in Egypt. It was Malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the
Bandung Conference, where 29 Asian and African, post-colonial nations,
met to discuss their own fates independent of colonial powers, including
the U.S. Black American support for anti-imperialist movements did not
find a space in the Times' analysis of Syria. The writers and editorial
staff at the Times are oblivious to the histories of the Third World
peoples living in their midst. Therefore, for Black people who
understand this history, they recognize articles like the one published
in the Times as imperial propaganda pieces for global white supremacy.
Yet, the Times, in that regard, is no different than any other white
American newspaper, magazine or news program or politician. They all
(even, or especially, the Black ones) present a Eurocentric worldview
that excludes the ideas, histories and analysis of its black population.
We are irrelevant. We serve the function we have always served: subjects
of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign
policy. Blacks can nominally participate in the American experience, but
only so long as we stay in our place and as long as we support the
"manifest destiny" of the global hegemon and not get in its way. We are
cannon fodder for the imperialist wars abroad and casualties in the U.S.
war on drugs and on poor Black life at home. "Malcolm traveled the globe
making personal connections with African heads of state, including
Nasser in Egypt." The presence of a black face at the head of the empire
has provided cover for U.S. imperialism in Africa and Asia, but it has
not diminished the anti-imperialism of the black community. It has
silenced the voices of the self-appointed black "leaders" and revealed
them to be supporters of empire and oppression. The Times, too, or
rather again, reveals itself as a supporter of the Pentagon by
publishing an article that is short on true analysis of America's
support of terrorists in Syria, as well as presenting a limited, white
supremacist parameter of debate. [Although the African American
tradition of anti-imperialism may not be important to the Times, it is a
tradition that is still alive nonetheless. And neither the Black face of
the empire, nor the white press in service to it, can diminish it. [Our
antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized]{.mark} in the
pages of the Times, [but it lives on in our continued support for
amnesty for Assata Shakur, the release of all political
prisoners]{.mark} from Leonard Peltier to Jalil Muntiquim and Oscar
Rivera Lopez, [to support for Palestinian self-determination]{.mark}, to
opposition to the re-colonization of Africa by America's Africa Command,
to the growing support by Black athletes, young and old, of Colin
Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the National Anthem, to our opposition
to all U.S. wars of aggression, including the ones in Libya and Syria.
African Americans' opposition to the U.S. supported aggression in Syria,
masquerading as humanitarian support, is obviously irrelevant to the
Times, but Malcolm X told us plainly years ago, that the media would
have us thinking the good guy was the bad guy and vice
versa.]{.underline} So whether, or even if, Assad is a "ruthless
dictator," the term the U.S. has used against everyone from Castro to
Chavez, it does not therefore mean that African Americans agree that the
U.S. has the right to support insurrection in Syria. We know imperialism
is Euro-American, white, capitalist venture that is carried against "the
darker nations," not for them. Malcolm, Martin and Mandela taught us
well.

The events in Charlottesville have remained in the headlines for the
last few weeks for a variety of reasons. Surprise at the audacity of a
torch-light procession of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, and
"alt-rightists" in an American city, coupled with the murder of social
justice activist Heather Heyer during a counterdemonstration, fueled the
initial coverage. President Trump's abhorrent response to the tragedy
and local struggles against Confederate statues kept it alive. And
frequently dimwitted debates about the merits of antifa have supplied
yet more conversational oxygen. But it would be a mistake for the
American left to see this as a decisive turning point in history, or
mistake torch-wielding fascists for a mass force. On the contrary:
getting consumed by debates about supporting antifa in its street
clashes with neo-Nazis misses the larger political landscape. [[The
post-Charlottesville moment does demand **antiracist
mobilizations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it's heartening that left
organizations have sprung into action and seen their numbers swell.
Standing up to the far right --- particularly when done effectively and
en masse, like in Boston --- can energize people who are otherwise
frustrated and disenchanted because of the Trump administration.
[[But]{.mark} that [needs]{.mark} to be linked to [tangible]{.mark}
political [organizing]{.mark} [that]{.mark} **[goes beyond the]{.mark}
[defensive]{.mark} or [symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Discussions
about antifa are also important. Interviews with counter-protestors on
the ground in Charlottesville made it clear they were more than happy
antifa was there to help. In fact, Cornel West credited them with saving
his life. But the debate over antifa cannot be at the center of left
political discussion. [[I am less concerned about]{.mark} being murdered
by [a neo-Nazi than]{.mark} I am about the **[lack of]{.mark} [access to
quality]{.mark} [health care]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I am more exercised
about the suppression of voting rights and the damage it does to
democracy in the here and now than the damage simply represented by
Confederate statues. This is not to dismiss the efforts to tear down
Confederate statutes. What lies in the public commons, after all, needs
to represent the kind of country we want the United States to be. But we
shouldn't allow the conflagration to cloud our vision. In short, the
lessons post-Charlottesville are the lessons we should have learned
earlier this year. [[We cannot simply react to Trump]{.mark} or the
"alt-right." **Being proactive**, **[advancing a]{.mark} clear
[program]{.mark}** [that can mobilize]{.mark} and galvanize a huge swath
of [the public]{.mark} --- this [must be the hallmark]{.mark} of the

**squander our chance** to build the kind of broad-based left that, in
the end, is the best bulwark against the far
right]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Politics We Need Most of the
planks of the left platform we need are already out there, waiting to be
used to spur genuine debate and action across American society. Two in
particular should top any left agenda. The first is universal health
care: Medicare for All. The Republicans' haphazard bid to scrap the
Affordable Care Act showed that even an extremely flawed version of
"universal" coverage was still popular enough to scuttle repeal
attempts. Now, according to recent polling, [public support for
**single-payer** is on the rise]{.underline}. Even centrist Democrats
like Kamala Harris are getting on board. [After **decades of struggle**,
universal health care is, if not right around the corner, at least on
the near horizon. Crucially, **the demand for Medicare for All also
offers a means to build the bonds of solidarity**. As Atlantic writer
Vann R. Newkirk recently pointed out, Martin Luther King Jr and other
**civil rights activists** saw universal health care as **a critical
component** of their struggle for a just and equitable
society.]{.underline} The same is true today. [Across movements ---
whether for **black lives** or a **fifteen-dollar minimum wage** or
**immigrant rights** --- universal health care is a demand that
unifies]{.underline}. There's another reason to prioritize the push for
universal health care. Far-right organizations like the Traditionalist
Workers Party have begun making overtures to poor whites in places like
Appalachia by talking about jobs and access to quality health care. We
can't allow a pitch for decent health care, or an argument for good
jobs, to be used as a gateway to fascism. Universal voting rights should
be the second demand of any immediate left platform. Our political and
economic system can't be changed, radically and in the long-term,
through voting. But countless people are being hurt by the system as it
exists today, and substantially boosting voter turnout is a prerequisite
for winning the reforms that will improve their lives in the short term.
Conservatives understand the importance of voting rights. In recent
years, numerous GOP-controlled states have passed laws restricting the
franchise, whether through ID requirements or shorter windows for voter
registration. They know a smaller, demoralized voting base makes it
harder to get left candidates into office. In the past, the Populist era
of the 1890s came to a crashing halt in part because of Jim Crow laws
and new state constitutions across the South that severely limited
voting rights for African Americans (and many poor whites as well). On
the flip side, the rise of a strong voting base in the urbanized North,
which included union members and African Americans, propelled the New
Deal forward and gave social democracy in America some of its earliest
and most important victories --- despite opposition from both
conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats. More recently, results
at the local level have testified to the enduring power of a mobilized
electorate. Victories by Chokwe Lumumba in Jackson, Mississippi's
mayoral race and khalid kamau in South Fulton, Georgia's city council
election were made possible by left-wing political activism on the
ground. That these victories occurred in the Deep South and with heavy
political participation from African Americans also belies common
perceptions about what the Left looks like and where it can compete.
Both Lumumba and kamau met people where they were at, while also
sketching out an expansive vision. Which brings me to another important
part of the Left's post-Charlottesville toolbox: political education.
[**[The debate]{.mark}** over monuments and Confederate flags [is a
perfect opportunity to get Americans thinking]{.mark} **not just
[about]{.mark} the world we live in, but [the kind of world we could
live in if the Left was given the opportunity to
lead.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Beyond considering what statues to tear
down, we should discuss what statues should replace them. Why not more
monuments, across the country, to the United States Colored Troops or
Harriet Tubman? But we should not stop with statues and public history,
as important as they are to shaping future debates about the country's
fate. [**[Political education]{.mark}** [should]{.mark} reach out to a
wide range of Americans, both **[expand]{.mark}ing their [conception of
what's possible]{.mark}** and learning how they see the
world]{.underline}. Left education, after all, should be a two-way
street. It can take a variety of forms --- from setting up a booth at a
community event or organizing a teach-in at a union hall to simply
making sure socialist organizations are as open to the public as
possible. Examples of political education, as I describe it, already
exist. In my adopted home state of South Carolina, the SC Progressive
Network offers a yearly "Modjeska Simkins School" to budding activists.
Named after one of the state's greatest human rights advocates, the
seminar teaches history as well as protest and activist tactics. It, and
other education efforts like it across the nation, are the spiritual
grandchildren of the Highlander Folk School in the 1930s, '40s, and
'50s. Finally, mass protest against white supremacy will continue to be
a crucial tactic going forward. The rally in Boston last month, where a
handful of neo-Nazis were met with over thirty thousand
counter-protesters, was an enormous victory for progressives and the
Left. It demonstrated the power of solidarity, viscerally and publicly.
But such actions must also be tied to the sorts of political programs
and tactics pitched above --- using them as opportunities to not only
bring together everyone opposed to white supremacy, but talking to
people about the ways in which class warfare from above, gender and
racial discrimination, and a revanchist politics hurts virtually
everyone every day. We can't let facile narratives about "poor whites"
drive the discourse on racism in American society. The white
supremacists that marched in defense of the Robert E. Lee statue
included many well-off, college-educated whites that would have no
qualms throwing away the lives of poor white Americans. They would also
destroy the lives and aspirations of African Americans, Jews, Latinos,
immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. [[By challenging these narratives
and linking them to]{.mark} **[concrete demands]{.mark}** for a better
future, [we can]{.mark} [reach out to people who]{.mark} were galvanized
by Charlottesville but [might not know what can be done next]{.mark}.
Breaking White Supremacy\'s Back [These recommendations aren't
politically sexy. They don't seem the stuff of revolution. But they're
the **necessary materials for**]{.mark} **[improving political]{.mark}
[conditions in the near future]{.mark} --- [which]{.mark} [has to be
done before we can work for more transformative
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Political
education]{.underline}]{.mark}[, for example, [will be crucial]{.mark}
for resuscitating the labor movement]{.underline}, to avoid more defeats
like those suffered in union drives at Boeing's plant in Charleston,
South Carolina or Nissan's plant in Canton, Mississippi. [[A strong left
**expands the public sphere**, offering a broader conception of what's
politically attainable]{.underline}]{.mark}. It offers people a politics
not of scapegoating or austerity but universal health care and
democratic agency. Historically, **[[it's been the most potent antidote
to the far right]{.mark}. [But we must also remember that victory in
street battles does not equal a durable political
victory.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Nor, on the other hand, is seeing a
Democratic House in 2018 or a Democrat in the White House in 2020 the
final measure of victory. The problems of Trump's America are, not
surprisingly, much like the problems of Obama's America. And Bush's
America. And Clinton's America. [[An effective left]{.mark}
post-Charlottesville [will have to concern itself]{.mark}, as always,
[with **long-term planning**]{.mark} and patient
organizing]{.underline}. That's the only way we'll finally break the
back of white identity politics --- the only identity politics to ever
wield real political power in America.

**[[A slew of democratic candidates hoping to challenge President Donald

Democrats who have launched campaigns in the 2020 election showed up to
the civil rights organization's annual conference this week in a
Sheraton hotel ballroom in Manhattan's Times Square. Eight of those
candidates gave speeches on Friday -- including Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio,
who had just announced his campaign a day earlier -- touching on a range
of issues including taxes, child care and climate change. But the
predominant themes of their remarks mirrored the NAN's own
[stated]{.mark} priorities, particularly [reforming the criminal justice
system with the past and current impacts of racism in America]{.mark} at

himself, also affirmed their support for a bill introduced in Congress
that would create a commission to study reparations for
African-Americans. "When I am elected president, I will sign that bill,"
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told Sharpton to raucous applause from the

#### Uniqueness: If the Dems swing too far to the radical left to spark voter turnout amongst Progressives and New voters they risk galvanizing the right and losing key Swing Voters that helped Swing the 2018 Midterm Results

**Brownstein, 6-4-29** (Robert, CNN Senior Political Analyst, CNN
Politics,
https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/politics/trump-voters-switch-to-democrats-in-2018-2020/index.html)

In fact, Catalist calculated that nearly **[90% of the Democrats\'
increase in their total vote from 2016 to 2018 came from switches among
the roughly 99 million people who participated in both
elections]{.underline}**. Catalist projects that Democrats virtually
broke even among those two-time voters in 2016 but won them by about 5
percentage points in 2018. **[Vote switching, as opposed to shifts in
the electorate\'s composition, accounted for about three-fourths or more
of the Democrats\' improvement compared with the 2016 presidential
results]{.underline}** in a wide variety of states, Catalist found.
Those included their Senate victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Ohio, Nevada and Arizona, as well as governor\'s victories in
Nevada, Michigan and Maine. Catalist\'s research methods didn\'t allow
it to estimate how many of the voters who moved to the Democrats in 2018
had switched from voting for Trump in 2016 versus how many switched from
supporting one of the third-party candidates, libertarian Gary Johnson
and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. But Ghitza said that estimates he\'s
seen in other private Democratic analyses of the election are that Trump
voters accounted for about three-fourths of the switchers and former
third-party voters about one-fourth. **[The overall level of movement
from Trump doesn\'t signal that his base is cracking. But it does
suggest that it\'s a mistake to view all of his voters as immovably
locked in behind him]{.underline}**. \"He got votes from people who
aren\'t considered his base in 2016,\" Ghitza said. \"And so this could
certainly be consistent \... with the idea that he has a floor and those
people aren\'t leaving him but there are still swing voters out there
that could be had.\" **[These new findings aren\'t likely to end the
roiling debate among Democrats about whether to emphasize mobilization
of base voters or persuasion of swing voters in 2020]{.underline}**.
**[Comparing the]{.underline}** 2018 vote with the
**[results]{.underline}** in 2014, as opposed to 2016, **[tilts the
outcome so that mobilization looks relatively more
important]{.underline}**, Ghitza notes. And the likelihood that total
turnout could increase significantly in 2020 \-- Catalist projects that
over 15 million more people may vote next year than in 2016 \-- will
also encourage Democrats who want to prioritize mobilization, since many
newly eligible voters are young and nonwhite. **[The big question for
that strategy is whether the Democratic message \-- and nominee \-- can
inspire more turnout from those groups without becoming so polarizing
that they help Trump mobilize his own core supporters, or alienate the
swing voters who abandoned him in 2018.]{.underline}** \"There\'s
something to that argument\" for mobilization, Ghitza says. \"But it\'s
clear that it is best to both mobilize and persuade, and to find a
message that can do both. **[If the Democratic candidate has a message
that only appeals to certain pieces of the country, then those
mobilization advantages could end up being counteracted by increasing
support for Trump on the other side.\"]{.underline}**

A candidate who favored single-payer government-run health-care plan for
all Americans, sometimes called Medicare for All, a guaranteed
government job for all Americans, free college for all Americans OR B) A
candidate who supports creating 1 million new apprenticeship positions,

[[Distrust in political elites and institutions has become a defining
element of 21st century politics]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the
west. [[This trend has been most successfully harnessed by right wing
populists]{.mark}, who]{.underline} claim to [**represent the anger of
the masses and represent their 'true interests', in the face of a greedy
and out of touch liberal political class**.]{.underline} While in no way
am I attempting to reduce the victories of those [**[such
as]{.underline}** [Donald Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}[, Marine Le Pen, or
Rob Ford]{.underline}, to solely this, [appropriating anger toward
elites has been critical to their political success. [The failure by
much of the left to offer a more effective response to these trends has
been disheartening]{.mark}]{.underline} (to say the least). Moreover, it
is why Hilary Wainwright's latest book, [[A New Politics from the
Left]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cambridge, UK: Polity Press), [[represents a
timely appeal for a democratic, participatory, and bottom-up political
transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Wainwright has spent her career
exploring democratic accountability across institutions, and as a
co-editor of the socialist, feminist, and green Red Pepper magazine.
Drawing upon her experiences as an academic and advocate, Wainwright
forcefully argues that [[we need to reorganize political power so that
it can be wielded by regular people, giving them the tools to positively
change their lives and communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} A New Politics
from the Left is a short read, and not theoretically dense. What it
offers is [a straightforward and accessible overview of the political
change]{.underline} that Wainwright is calling for. She begins by
challenging the notions of both the technocratic, elite knowledge of the
state, and the individualized knowledge of the free market, with its own
technocratic logic of profit extraction, as sources upon which to base
public decision making. Instead, she argues that [we should look to the
sort of practical and tacit knowledge which is practiced and produced by
social movements, in particular the women's, radical shop stewards', and
green movement.]{.underline} Sharing Knowledge For Wainwright, [these
movements "illustrated, in the way they organized, how this tacit
knowledge might be shared... they are capable of purposeful and planned
action, through collaboration and without predictive certainty,
constantly subject to further experiment and
self-reflexivity"]{.underline} (p. 8-9). She contrasts the paternal
concept of "power as domination," where political leaders tell people
what they need and then implement it, with ["power as transformative
capacity," **where policy ideas and implementation come from the
everyday knowledge of those most impacted**.]{.underline} Wainwright
notes [**the utilization of "power as transformative capacity**" growing
in Britain out of feminist movements, as well as community
organizations, in the 1960s. Instead of having a governing party do
something on their behalf, these groups engaged in action with its own
directly transformative capacity. They rejected traditional deference to
authority, and sought to democratize knowledge, "breaking from models
that presume an expert leadership and more or less ignorant membership,"
and emphasizing popular education]{.underline} (p. 19). [The collective
self-confidence of people to take control of the conditions of their
lives has also]{.underline}, according to Wainwright, [played out within
the Labour Party itself, such as the 1945 government, and again in 1973
-- though in ambiguous, contradictory, and temporary ways. The
relationship between bottom up change and existing political
institutions is explored]{.underline} more fully as the book develops.
Wainwright powerfully illustrates the sort of positive political project
she is advocating through [three key examples.]{.underline} She
describes [the push in the 1970s by Lucas Aerospace workers who, facing
massive job cutbacks and restructuring, **developed a detailed plan to
nationalize and reconfigure the company toward applying the technology
for socially useful purposes.**]{.underline} While the plan received the
support of then-Industry Secretary Tony Benn, corporate pressure and the
1979 defeat of Labour meant it was never implemented. She also describes
[the successful pushback by Newcastle municipal IT workers in 1999 when
the City Council considered contracting their work to a private firm.
They successfully campaigned against privatization, and instead created
an alternative strategy to improve the service based on maximizing
public benefit.]{.underline} Finally, Wainwright looks at [the growth of
digital space, and its utilization to create new democratic spaces, such
as 'platform co-operatives' as an alternative to the 'platform
capitalism' of companies like Uber.]{.underline} These examples work to
illustrate how [positive alternatives to neoliberalism can be developed
from a bottom up, participatory capacity, through everyday shared
knowledge. More than just resisting, these examples developed new forms
of social relations beyond austerity and market logic.]{.underline}
Wainwright's examples are well chosen, in particular her [discussion of
democratic digital spaces is a refreshing counter note to the abhorrent
tech ventures of Silicon Valley, which continually find new ways to use
technology to further exploit and profit from the most vulnerable. Role
of the State]{.underline} One point I would like to raise about [these
examples]{.underline} though, is that they [all sought to turn the state
into a positive ally.]{.underline} In the remainder of the book,
Wainwright argues that **[to develop 'power as transformative capacity',
the state's 'power as domination' is a necessary condition for its full
realization]{.underline}**. I agree with Wainwright that [[state
institutions can be used, "where the balance of political power is
favourable, to pursue social goals]{.mark}"]{.underline} (p. 76). I
think **[[it is important to work to elect left governments that will
enable social transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That being said,
[positive transformational change is also possible through a more
adversarial approach with state actors.]{.underline} Moreover, sometimes

###  Latinx Politics DA 1NC

#### Uniqueness: Latinx voters are the largest racial and ethnic minority voting in 2020 -- the Latinx vote is key for the election of Democrats.

reporter at Politico, where he writes about the intersection of media
and politics. "Democrats try out their Spanish on TV as they court

**[Democratic contenders are using Spanish-language television to
introduce themselves to a voting demographic that will be crucial to
deciding the party's nominee for 2020]{.underline} --- and that largely
has no clue who they are. Castro ranked third in a Univision poll of
eligible Hispanic voters released Tuesday, with former Vice President
Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders --- the two candidates with the most
name recognition --- leading. [The other contenders]{.underline},
according to Lourdes Torres, Univision's senior vice president for
political coverage & special projects, ["virtually are not known" to the
network's audience. That could be a problem for Democratic presidential
hopefuls. Latino voters are a key constituency in the primary and likely
the largest racial or ethnic minority in the electorate in 2020,
according to the Pew Research Center]{.underline}. [Hillary Clinton's
performance was weaker than expected with Latinos in 2016, and it might
have helped cost her the state of Florida. Just 55 percent of Hispanics
eligible to vote say Democrats are doing a good job communicating with
them]{.underline}, Univision found. Though Trump and the Republicans
fared worse, at 22 percent[, the poll also indicated that large chunks
of potential voters had either no opinion of or didn't know many of the
Democrats. "The future of the United States is directly linked to the
future of Latinos," Cesar Conde, chairman of NBCUniversal International
Group and NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, said in an interview with
POLITICO]{.underline}. He added that "any candidate to reach the White
House is going to have to speak to the Latino community." Republicans
and Democrats have emphasized Latino voters in previous election cycles.
White House hopefuls such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush gave interviews to
Spanish-language networks, and Hillary Clinton appeared on both
Telemundo and Univision. But Democrats' decision to have Telemundo
broadcast the debates in Miami with NBC and MSNBC on Wednesday and
Thursday --- the first time a Spanish-language network is co-hosting the
first debate of an election cycle --- shows a heightened emphasis on
these platforms.**

#### And, Trump is dismantling arms sales regulations to Latin America -- it is imperative that we orient ourselves towards voting him out of office.

**[Under the current U.S. rules, which the Trump administration is now
on the verge of eliminating, a gun company seeking to sell weapons
abroad must apply for an export license and provide information on the
buyer.]{.underline}** State Department officials examine the application
for signs of trafficking, like unfamiliar or blacklisted customers. The
department's official guidance suggests taking into account how the arms
shipment might affect a range U.S. foreign-policy aims, including
counterterrorism. It also mandates consultation with embassies and law
enforcement. If the applicant wants to sell \$1 million or more worth of
guns (or \$14 million or more worth of larger military equipment), the
State Department must notify Congress. Elected officials can then delay
or cancel deals. Foreign service officers also perform "end-use" checks
to confirm that the person or entity receiving the weapons matches the
customer on the application. **[Critics in Congress and at think tanks
argue that the State Department export process still allows far too many
guns to be sold into areas where they might be used to harm civilians or
supply criminals, including the Northern Triangle. The enforcement
guidance does not specify which human rights abuses might be
disqualifying or how to weigh the likelihood of exports being used in an
atrocity, according to John Lindsay-Poland, an activist with Global
Exchange who is focused on U.S. arms trade policy in Mexico and Central
America .]{.underline}** The U.S. regulations for granting export
licenses merely say the State Department should "take into account"
risks like human rights abuses or trafficking. One State Department
veteran insisted the rules were more than just window dressing. "It
certainly wasn't the case that these transactions were being licensed
and approved willy-nilly," said **[Ed Peartree, who worked as the
department's director for defense trade controls policy from 2013 to
2017. Peartree said that under his watch, license applications were
routinely denied, the size of exports reduced, and extensive conditions
imposed on the end use of firearms]{.underline}**. **[For all the
legitimate concern about corruption, Peartree said he had seen few
documented instances in which U.S. arms legally exported to police or
military forces were used by Mexican or Central American criminal
organizations.]{.underline}**

[[Distrust in political elites and institutions has become a defining
element of 21st century politics]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the
west. [[This trend has been most successfully harnessed by right wing
populists]{.mark}, who]{.underline} claim to [**represent the anger of
the masses and represent their 'true interests', in the face of a greedy
and out of touch liberal political class**.]{.underline} While in no way
am I attempting to reduce the victories of those [**[such
as]{.underline}** [Donald Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}[, Marine Le Pen, or
Rob Ford]{.underline}, to solely this, [appropriating anger toward
elites has been critical to their political success. [The failure by
much of the left to offer a more effective response to these trends has
been disheartening]{.mark}]{.underline} (to say the least). Moreover, it
is why Hilary Wainwright's latest book, [[A New Politics from the
Left]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cambridge, UK: Polity Press), [[represents a
timely appeal for a democratic, participatory, and bottom-up political
transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Wainwright has spent her career
exploring democratic accountability across institutions, and as a
co-editor of the socialist, feminist, and green Red Pepper magazine.
Drawing upon her experiences as an academic and advocate, Wainwright
forcefully argues that [[we need to reorganize political power so that
it can be wielded by regular people, giving them the tools to positively
change their lives and communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} A New Politics
from the Left is a short read, and not theoretically dense. What it
offers is [a straightforward and accessible overview of the political
change]{.underline} that Wainwright is calling for. She begins by
challenging the notions of both the technocratic, elite knowledge of the
state, and the individualized knowledge of the free market, with its own
technocratic logic of profit extraction, as sources upon which to base
public decision making. Instead, she argues that [we should look to the
sort of practical and tacit knowledge which is practiced and produced by
social movements, in particular the women's, radical shop stewards', and
green movement.]{.underline} Sharing Knowledge For Wainwright, [these
movements "illustrated, in the way they organized, how this tacit
knowledge might be shared... they are capable of purposeful and planned
action, through collaboration and without predictive certainty,
constantly subject to further experiment and
self-reflexivity"]{.underline} (p. 8-9). She contrasts the paternal
concept of "power as domination," where political leaders tell people
what they need and then implement it, with ["power as transformative
capacity," **where policy ideas and implementation come from the
everyday knowledge of those most impacted**.]{.underline} Wainwright
notes [**the utilization of "power as transformative capacity**" growing
in Britain out of feminist movements, as well as community
organizations, in the 1960s. Instead of having a governing party do
something on their behalf, these groups engaged in action with its own
directly transformative capacity. They rejected traditional deference to
authority, and sought to democratize knowledge, "breaking from models
that presume an expert leadership and more or less ignorant membership,"
and emphasizing popular education]{.underline} (p. 19). [The collective
self-confidence of people to take control of the conditions of their
lives has also]{.underline}, according to Wainwright, [played out within
the Labour Party itself, such as the 1945 government, and again in 1973
-- though in ambiguous, contradictory, and temporary ways. The
relationship between bottom up change and existing political
institutions is explored]{.underline} more fully as the book develops.
Wainwright powerfully illustrates the sort of positive political project
she is advocating through [three key examples.]{.underline} She
describes [the push in the 1970s by Lucas Aerospace workers who, facing
massive job cutbacks and restructuring, **developed a detailed plan to
nationalize and reconfigure the company toward applying the technology
for socially useful purposes.**]{.underline} While the plan received the
support of then-Industry Secretary Tony Benn, corporate pressure and the
1979 defeat of Labour meant it was never implemented. She also describes
[the successful pushback by Newcastle municipal IT workers in 1999 when
the City Council considered contracting their work to a private firm.
They successfully campaigned against privatization, and instead created
an alternative strategy to improve the service based on maximizing
public benefit.]{.underline} Finally, Wainwright looks at [the growth of
digital space, and its utilization to create new democratic spaces, such
as 'platform co-operatives' as an alternative to the 'platform
capitalism' of companies like Uber.]{.underline} These examples work to
illustrate how [positive alternatives to neoliberalism can be developed
from a bottom up, participatory capacity, through everyday shared
knowledge. More than just resisting, these examples developed new forms
of social relations beyond austerity and market logic.]{.underline}
Wainwright's examples are well chosen, in particular her [discussion of
democratic digital spaces is a refreshing counter note to the abhorrent
tech ventures of Silicon Valley, which continually find new ways to use
technology to further exploit and profit from the most vulnerable. Role
of the State]{.underline} One point I would like to raise about [these
examples]{.underline} though, is that they [all sought to turn the state
into a positive ally.]{.underline} In the remainder of the book,
Wainwright argues that **[to develop 'power as transformative capacity',
the state's 'power as domination' is a necessary condition for its full
realization]{.underline}**. I agree with Wainwright that [[state
institutions can be used, "where the balance of political power is
favourable, to pursue social goals]{.mark}"]{.underline} (p. 76). I
think **[[it is important to work to elect left governments that will
enable social transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That being said,
[positive transformational change is also possible through a more
adversarial approach with state actors.]{.underline} Moreover, sometimes
it is necessary.

#### Impact: US arms sales to Latin America are responsible for the militarization and mass increase of gun violence in Latin American countries, or the harms the aff outlines.

**The Economist 5/23/2019** (Guns from the United States are flooding
Latin America,
https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/05/23/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america)

Like a criminal and his fingerprints, every gun leaves its mark on the
ammunition it uses. Such traces are what Sergio Sandoval de la Peña
pores over daily in Mexico City's ballistics lab. A series of dark-green
circles, like the sub-woofer of a speaker, appear on his computer
screen. It is a digitised three-dimensional model of a cartridge, found
at the scene of a robbery this year and placed under a microscope.
Checking the marks against hundreds of thousands of potential matches,
Mr de la Peña concludes that the gun that ejected it was also used in a
murder last year. **[The ballistics technology employed to work such
wonders comes courtesy of the United States. Alas, so does the gun,
according to Mr de la Peña's database. A study of weapons found at crime
scenes suggests that 70% of gun crimes in Mexico involve American-bought
weapons. The share of homicides in Mexico involving a firearm grew from
16% in 1997 to 66% in 2017. That suggests around half of Mexico's 33,000
murder victims last year were killed by a gun manufactured in the United
States, which had 14,542 gun homicides in 2017. An American-made gun is
more likely to be used in a murder in Mexico than at
home.]{.underline}** Mexico is far from alone. Across Latin America, the
share of murders involving guns is creeping upwards. **[Many countries
already beset by organised crime and weak states have their troubles
compounded by their proximity to America, the country with the rich
world's most permissive gun laws. Changes signed by President Donald
Trump may only worsen the situation. Most guns enter Mexico after being
legally bought in the United States.]{.underline}** Criminal groups
typically use associates to buy them, smuggling guns in the opposite
direction to drugs. Beyond Mexico, American guns often arrive through
ports from Florida, hidden among other imported goods. In Honduras,
where half of all unregistered weapons come from America, smugglers have
been known to wrap guns in foil and submerge them in paint to avoid
detection from x-ray machines. Less creative, bigger groups simply pay
off customs officers. **[Does the availability of American guns boost
murder rates? The expiration in 2004 of an assault-weapons ban in the
United States provided a real-world experiment. A study found that in
Mexican municipalities bordering Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where
the guns were put back on sale, the murder rate shot up soon after.
Murder rates adjacent to California, which maintained a ban, stayed
flat.]{.underline}**

###  Radical Politics Trade Off Links

**Radical resistance must be paired with demands for institutional
change or we risk wasting the timeliness of our current moment -- Trump
has galvanized the left, but we can't lose momentum.**

**[Greene 17]{.underline}** Robert Greene II (PhD student at the
University of South Carolina and the book review editor for the Society
of US Intellectual Historians\' blog). "The Left After Charlottesville."
Jacobin. September 7^th^, 2017.
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/charlottesville-antifa-trump-medicare-for-all

The events in Charlottesville have remained in the headlines for the
last few weeks for a variety of reasons. Surprise at the audacity of a
torch-light procession of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, and
"alt-rightists" in an American city, coupled with the murder of social
justice activist Heather Heyer during a counterdemonstration, fueled the
initial coverage. President Trump's abhorrent response to the tragedy
and local struggles against Confederate statues kept it alive. And
frequently dimwitted debates about the merits of antifa have supplied
yet more conversational oxygen. But it would be a mistake for the
American left to see this as a decisive turning point in history, or
mistake torch-wielding fascists for a mass force. On the contrary:
getting consumed by debates about supporting antifa in its street
clashes with neo-Nazis misses the larger political landscape. [[The
post-Charlottesville moment does demand **antiracist
mobilizations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it's heartening that left
organizations have sprung into action and seen their numbers swell.
Standing up to the far right --- particularly when done effectively and
en masse, like in Boston --- can energize people who are otherwise
frustrated and disenchanted because of the Trump administration.
[[But]{.mark} that [needs]{.mark} to be linked to [tangible]{.mark}
political [organizing]{.mark} [that]{.mark} **[goes beyond the]{.mark}
[defensive]{.mark} or [symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Discussions
about antifa are also important. Interviews with counter-protestors on
the ground in Charlottesville made it clear they were more than happy
antifa was there to help. In fact, Cornel West credited them with saving
his life. But the debate over antifa cannot be at the center of left
political discussion. [[I am less concerned about]{.mark} being murdered
by [a neo-Nazi than]{.mark} I am about the **[lack of]{.mark} [access to
quality]{.mark} [health care]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I am more exercised
about the suppression of voting rights and the damage it does to
democracy in the here and now than the damage simply represented by
Confederate statues. This is not to dismiss the efforts to tear down
Confederate statutes. What lies in the public commons, after all, needs
to represent the kind of country we want the United States to be. But we
shouldn't allow the conflagration to cloud our vision. In short, the
lessons post-Charlottesville are the lessons we should have learned
earlier this year. [[We cannot simply react to Trump]{.mark} or the
"alt-right." **Being proactive**, **[advancing a]{.mark} clear
[program]{.mark}** [that can mobilize]{.mark} and galvanize a huge swath
of [the public]{.mark} --- this [must be the hallmark]{.mark} of the
American left. [Otherwise]{.mark}, the genuine **[anger]{.mark} directed
[at Trump]{.mark} and the GOP [will be wasted.]{.mark}** And we'll
**squander our chance** to build the kind of broad-based left that, in
the end, is the best bulwark against the far right]{.underline}. The
Politics We Need Most of the planks of the left platform we need are
already out there, waiting to be used to spur genuine debate and action
across American society. Two in particular should top any left agenda.
The first is universal health care: Medicare for All. The Republicans'
haphazard bid to scrap the Affordable Care Act showed that even an
extremely flawed version of "universal" coverage was still popular
enough to scuttle repeal attempts. Now, according to recent polling,
[public support for **single-payer** is on the rise]{.underline}. Even
centrist Democrats like Kamala Harris are getting on board. [After
**decades of struggle**, universal health care is, if not right around
the corner, at least on the near horizon. Crucially, **the demand for
Medicare for All also offers a means to build the bonds of solidarity**.
As Atlantic writer Vann R. Newkirk recently pointed out, Martin Luther
King Jr and other **civil rights activists** saw universal health care
as **a critical component** of their struggle for a just and equitable
society.]{.underline} The same is true today. [Across movements ---
whether for **black lives** or a **fifteen-dollar minimum wage** or
**immigrant rights** --- universal health care is a demand that
unifies]{.underline}. There's another reason to prioritize the push for
universal health care. Far-right organizations like the Traditionalist
Workers Party have begun making overtures to poor whites in places like
Appalachia by talking about jobs and access to quality health care. We
can't allow a pitch for decent health care, or an argument for good
jobs, to be used as a gateway to fascism. Universal voting rights should
be the second demand of any immediate left platform. Our political and
economic system can't be changed, radically and in the long-term,
through voting. But countless people are being hurt by the system as it
exists today, and substantially boosting voter turnout is a prerequisite
for winning the reforms that will improve their lives in the short term.
Conservatives understand the importance of voting rights. In recent
years, numerous GOP-controlled states have passed laws restricting the
franchise, whether through ID requirements or shorter windows for voter
registration. They know a smaller, demoralized voting base makes it
harder to get left candidates into office. In the past, the Populist era
of the 1890s came to a crashing halt in part because of Jim Crow laws
and new state constitutions across the South that severely limited
voting rights for African Americans (and many poor whites as well). On
the flip side, the rise of a strong voting base in the urbanized North,
which included union members and African Americans, propelled the New
Deal forward and gave social democracy in America some of its earliest
and most important victories --- despite opposition from both
conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats. More recently, results
at the local level have testified to the enduring power of a mobilized
electorate. Victories by Chokwe Lumumba in Jackson, Mississippi's
mayoral race and khalid kamau in South Fulton, Georgia's city council
election were made possible by left-wing political activism on the
ground. That these victories occurred in the Deep South and with heavy
political participation from African Americans also belies common
perceptions about what the Left looks like and where it can compete.
Both Lumumba and kamau met people where they were at, while also
sketching out an expansive vision. Which brings me to another important
part of the Left's post-Charlottesville toolbox: political education.
[**[The debate]{.mark}** over monuments and Confederate flags [is a
perfect opportunity to get Americans thinking]{.mark} **not just
[about]{.mark} the world we live in, but [the kind of world we could
live in if the Left was given the opportunity to
lead.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Beyond considering what statues to tear
down, we should discuss what statues should replace them. Why not more
monuments, across the country, to the United States Colored Troops or
Harriet Tubman? But we should not stop with statues and public history,
as important as they are to shaping future debates about the country's
fate. [**[Political education]{.mark}** [should]{.mark} reach out to a
wide range of Americans, both **[expand]{.mark}ing their [conception of
what's possible]{.mark}** and learning how they see the
world]{.underline}. Left education, after all, should be a two-way
street. It can take a variety of forms --- from setting up a booth at a
community event or organizing a teach-in at a union hall to simply
making sure socialist organizations are as open to the public as
possible. Examples of political education, as I describe it, already
exist. In my adopted home state of South Carolina, the SC Progressive
Network offers a yearly "Modjeska Simkins School" to budding activists.
Named after one of the state's greatest human rights advocates, the
seminar teaches history as well as protest and activist tactics. It, and
other education efforts like it across the nation, are the spiritual
grandchildren of the Highlander Folk School in the 1930s, '40s, and
'50s. Finally, mass protest against white supremacy will continue to be
a crucial tactic going forward. The rally in Boston last month, where a
handful of neo-Nazis were met with over thirty thousand
counter-protesters, was an enormous victory for progressives and the
Left. It demonstrated the power of solidarity, viscerally and publicly.
But such actions must also be tied to the sorts of political programs
and tactics pitched above --- using them as opportunities to not only
bring together everyone opposed to white supremacy, but talking to
people about the ways in which class warfare from above, gender and
racial discrimination, and a revanchist politics hurts virtually
everyone every day. We can't let facile narratives about "poor whites"
drive the discourse on racism in American society. The white
supremacists that marched in defense of the Robert E. Lee statue
included many well-off, college-educated whites that would have no
qualms throwing away the lives of poor white Americans. They would also
destroy the lives and aspirations of African Americans, Jews, Latinos,
immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. [[By challenging these narratives
and linking them to]{.mark} **[concrete demands]{.mark}** for a better
future, [we can]{.mark} [reach out to people who]{.mark} were galvanized
by Charlottesville but [might not know what can be done next]{.mark}.

#### African American populations are opposed to American imperialism and tend to identify with other black and brown people globally who are victims of imperialism

**Bullock 2016** (Bryan, practicing attorney who specializes in civil
rights and employment discrimination cases, won the Frederick Douglas
Human Rights Award, ran for state representative in 2008 and 2010,
9/08/16, \"Black American Anti-Imperialism: an Invisible Subject for the
New York Times ,\" Black Agenda Report,
<https://blackagendareport.com/black_american-anti-imperialism_nyt> ) ZH

From Vietnam through Iraq**[, African Americans have proved to be the
group of Americans most opposed to U.S. military
intervention]{.underline}**." The October 4, 2016, issue of **[the New
York Times]{.underline}**, which contained the article, "Syrian War
Magnifies Tension in America's Global Mission," is a case study in white
supremacy. The article is framed from a totally white "conservative" and
"liberal" frame, and **[completely ignores the perspective of African
Americans, who, traditionally, and today, are consistently and
overwhelmingly, anti-imperialism]{.underline}** and **[who tend to
identify with other Black and Brown people across the globe, including
the Palestinians and Syrians]{.underline}**. The article purports to
give "both sides" of the argument for U.S. intervention in the affairs
of sovereign nations. The authors of the article give the impression
that they are being "balanced" in giving the views of those who support
America's "mission" in the world and those who are "critical" of said
"mission." This false "balance" does not include the perspectives of any
African American historians or critics of U.S. foreign policy, like
Professor Gerald Horne, Bill Fletcher, Anthony Monteiro, Glen Ford or
African (American) scholars like Horace Campbell. In fact, "both sides"
of any debate in the U.S. regarding foreign policy, are both white
"sides." This is particularly true when it comes to U.S. foreign policy,
where whites are the only ones who are presumed to either have an
opinion on such issues, or one that is worth mentioning. It is true that
"both sides" could include Blacks who adhere to the Eurocentric,
party-line views of the dominant U.S. narrators, say, Donna Brazile or
Condoleezza Rice, or Blacks on the so-called "left," but their views
(still missing from this piece) are not a Black critique. It is a
Eurocentric critique coming from a Black person, which is fundamentally
different than an African American critique viewed through the lens of
the African American experience. The ideas, views and critiques of Black
thinkers are notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes
to foreign policy \-- which proves that the writers, the editorial staff
and the paper itself does not consider those views important. And in
ignoring those critiques, it also ignores the historical critical
analysis of the people who are and have been the subjects of U.S.
foreign policy. "[The ideas, views and critiques of Black thinkers are
notoriously absent in the pages of the Times when it comes to foreign
policy]{.underline}." It also completely ignores **[the analysis of
great Black historical thinkers like W.E.B. DuBois, Walter Rodney and
Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, the late stage Martin Luther King, Jr., as well
as the organizations they represented such as the Council on African
Affairs (the CAA), the NAACP of the 1940's, the African Liberation
Support Committee, the Black Panther Party, The African Blood
Brotherhood, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, Trans Africa, the
U.S. Human Rights Network, the United Negro Improvement Association or
the National Council of Black Lawyers, all of whom were deeply critical
of America's so-called mission in the world, especially as it related to
African and Asian peoples, like Haitians, Congolese, Syrians, Yemenis
and Palestinians]{.underline}**. The critiques of these people are
irrelevant to, not only the Times, but in truth, to the Democratic and
Republican parties, the current incarnation of the NAACP, the Black
Congressional Caucus, President Obama and most white liberal formations.
However, this is not a reason to give the Times a pass. Even the use of
the word "mission," with the European habit of sending missionaries into
Africa and the Americas to soften the people up with European religion
before they were subdued by hard power, does not elicit irony on the
part of the Times. The "white man's burden" of "civilizing" the darker
races of the world, through enslavement, destroying their religions,
cultures, languages, colonizing their lands and resource and extracting
their people and whisking them away to foreign lands to toil from birth
to death for free, is just as important and essential a part of the
history of "America's Global Mission" as anything else mentioned in the
piece. The hand wringing of the mostly white imperialists on the "left"
and on the right, regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism, is
essentially what the piece presents. No other perspectives or voices are
important or valid. Thus the perspectives of African American thinkers
are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns "black" issues
like police brutality, but not on international issues, although many
black writers and thinkers would argue the two are connected. This is so
even though the very presence people of African descent in America is a
direct result of the United States' foreign policy of capturing,
importing and enslaving African people. This point is lost on white
foreign policy writers. However, [early Black thinkers were clear on
this point. People like DuBois and Robeson, in the past, and
contemporaries like Glen Ford, were/are, fiercely
anti-imperialist]{.underline}. "The perspectives of African American
thinkers are only relevant in American discourse when it concerns
'black' issues like police brutality, but not on international issues."
The white, imperialist presentation in the article excludes the ideas of
Syrian Americans, Indigenous populations, Mexican and Puerto Rican
Americans and Hawaiians, all of whom may have a totally different idea
of America's "obligation" in Syria. Penny M. Von Eschen notes in the
book, Race Against Empire, Black Americans and Anticolonialism
1937-1957, that "Objecting to U.S. support for South African and the
European colonial powers, and increasingly challenging the notion that
America was the legitimate leader of the 'free world' and therefore
above censure, black Americans both criticized new directions in
American foreign policy and attempted to use the United Nations as a
forum in which to gain support for civil rights struggles in the United
States." **[African Americans are no less critical of America's
self-serving "mission" today as was then.]{.underline}** African
Americans were highly critical of the U.S.'s violent overthrow of the
African nation of Libya, its aggressions toward Cuba in the 60's and
Venezuela in the Chavez era and today. We have not forgotten America's
refusal to recognize Haiti as an independent Black nation when it
defeated the French. Nor are we unmindful of the U.S. invasion of Haiti
in 1915 and its support of dictators of the Duvalier family, the coup of
the Aristide government and the fact that President Obama tried to
prevent Aristide from returning to Haiti. [Black thinkers on
international issues are highly supportive of the Palestinian cause and
troubled by the continued expansion of AFRICOM, the U.S. Africa Command,
on the continent.]{.underline} This analysis is glaringly absent from
mainstream media portrayals of America's "duty" in the world. The Times
article offers the view that, "Because many Americans see their foreign
policy as a grand mission to make the world a better place, they tend to
divide the world into heroes who support their ideals and villains who
oppose them." But which Americans are the writers talking about and
whose "ideals" are represented in U.S. foreign policy. It is certain
that the views of people like George Padmore, a leader in the
Pan-African movement in the 40's and 50's, are not represented by this
view. Padmore was clear that, "Empire and peace are incompatible[."
Michael C. Dawson notes, in Blacks in and Out of the Left: "from Vietnam
through Iraq, African Americans have proved to be the group of Americans
most opposed to U.S. military intervention." It is also purposely
"forgotten" that the Black Panther Party was, following in the footsteps
of their ideological predecessor, Malcolm X, staunchly
anti-imperialist]{.underline}. As Eldridge Cleaver noted, the U.S. was
"bankrolling and arming all of the oppressive regimes around the world."
One of the agenda items contained in the National Black Political
Agenda, created in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 called for an end to the
Vietnam War and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and
Africa; the withdrawal of U.S. military, corporations, and
communications facilities from southern Africa and the Third World;
self-determination of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; an end to
sanctions against Cuba and the closure of the American military base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "African Americans were highly critical of the
U.S.'s violent overthrow of the African nation of Libya, its aggressions
toward Cuba in the 60's and Venezuela in the Chavez era and today."
Contemporary white American analysis of U.S. foreign excludes the
historical reality that, in thinking of America's support of so-called
rebels in Syria and Libya, it is clear to African Americans that America
never supported a single African liberation group in Africa. It is not
lost on Black Americans that the African National Congress and Nelson
Mandela were considered terrorists by the U.S. No African rebel movement
seeking independence from the Dutch, British, French, German, Portuguese
or Italian colonizers of African lands ever received a single drop of
military support from Washington. The U.S. never supported the Mau Mau
in Kenya, nor Frelimo in Mozambique, nor the ANC in South Africa, or any
other revolutionary movement on the continent. In fact, the contrary is
true. From the coup against Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to the assassination
of Patrice Lumuumba in the Congo, to the capture of Nelson Mandela and
to the support the racist apartheid system of South African and the
murderous colonial regime in the former Rhodesia, the American
government has consistently and forcefully opposed revolutionary
movements in Africa and in fact supported their colonial oppressors. The
only country to ever militarily support African liberation was Cuba, not
the U.S. Regarding Mandela, (who the U.S. considered a terrorist) we
heard him clearly when, in response to a request to condemn Fidel
Castro, Yassar Arafat and Mommar Ghadifi, he said, your enemies are not
necessarily our enemies. Indeed, not only did Castro send troops to aid
the Angolans in defeating the South Africans, he also provided refuge
for many African American freedom fighters, from Robert Williams to
Assata Shakur. While the U.S. was infiltrating, surveilling and
murdering Black political activists in the Black Panther Party, leaders
of North Vietnam, China, Algeria and Cuba welcomed them as ambassadors
of the African American community. ["It is clear to African Americans
that America never supported a single African liberation group."
Understanding this historical reality, Black thinkers are justifiably
critical and suspicious of U.S. intentions in places like Iraq, Iran,
Syria and Libya. The greatest thinkers in African American culture
explicitly made the connection between the U.S. and European colonialism
abroad, in places like Syria, as an extension of the domestic policy of
treating African Americans as second class citizens -- or, as some
African American thinkers have argued, the domestic colonization of
Black people.]{.underline} The genocide of the Native Americans
resonates with Black Americans. Leaders from MLK, who connected
America's imperialism in Vietnam, and the tax dollars used to support
it, to the lack of financial resources available to be used to build
cities and provide a basic wage; to Malcolm, who traveled the globe
making personal connections with African heads of state, including
Nasser in Egypt. It was Malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the
Bandung Conference, where 29 Asian and African, post-colonial nations,
met to discuss their own fates independent of colonial powers, including
the U.S. Black American support for anti-imperialist movements did not
find a space in the Times' analysis of Syria. The writers and editorial
staff at the Times are oblivious to the histories of the Third World
peoples living in their midst. Therefore, for Black people who
understand this history, they recognize articles like the one published
in the Times as imperial propaganda pieces for global white supremacy.
Yet, the Times, in that regard, is no different than any other white
American newspaper, magazine or news program or politician. They all
(even, or especially, the Black ones) present a Eurocentric worldview
that excludes the ideas, histories and analysis of its black population.
We are irrelevant. We serve the function we have always served: subjects
of imperialism, scapegoats for repression, but not shapers of foreign
policy. Blacks can nominally participate in the American experience, but
only so long as we stay in our place and as long as we support the
"manifest destiny" of the global hegemon and not get in its way. We are
cannon fodder for the imperialist wars abroad and casualties in the U.S.
war on drugs and on poor Black life at home. "Malcolm traveled the globe
making personal connections with African heads of state, including
Nasser in Egypt." The presence of a black face at the head of the empire
has provided cover for U.S. imperialism in Africa and Asia, but it has
not diminished the anti-imperialism of the black community. It has
silenced the voices of the self-appointed black "leaders" and revealed
them to be supporters of empire and oppression. The Times, too, or
rather again, reveals itself as a supporter of the Pentagon by
publishing an article that is short on true analysis of America's
support of terrorists in Syria, as well as presenting a limited, white
supremacist parameter of debate. [Although the African American
tradition of anti-imperialism may not be important to the Times, it is a
tradition that is still alive nonetheless. And neither the Black face of
the empire, nor the white press in service to it, can diminish it. Our
antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized in the pages of the
Times, but it lives on in our continued support for amnesty for Assata
Shakur, the release of all political prisoners from Leonard Peltier to
Jalil Muntiquim and Oscar Rivera Lopez, to support for Palestinian
self-determination, to opposition to the re-colonization of Africa by
America's Africa Command, to the growing support by Black athletes,
young and old, of Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the National
Anthem, to our opposition to all U.S. wars of aggression, including the
ones in Libya and Syria. African Americans' opposition to the U.S.
supported aggression in Syria, masquerading as humanitarian support, is
obviously irrelevant to the Times, but Malcolm X told us plainly years
ago, that the media would have us thinking the good guy was the bad guy
and vice versa.]{.underline} So whether, or even if, Assad is a
"ruthless dictator," the term the U.S. has used against everyone from
Castro to Chavez, it does not therefore mean that African Americans
agree that the U.S. has the right to support insurrection in Syria. We
know imperialism is Euro-American, white, capitalist venture that is
carried against "the darker nations," not for them. Malcolm, Martin and
Mandela taught us well.

[On the surface, [it would seem]{.mark}]{.underline} that

Donald [[Trump]{.mark} and]{.underline} Third-World [strongmen like
Philippine president]{.underline} Rodrigo [Duterte all gleefully reject
books, history and]{.underline} higher [education in favor of railing

And [you'll find few Trump supporters among the largely left-wing
American professoriate. Yet **[intellectuals are accountable]{.mark}**
for the rise of these movements]{.underline}---albeit
[indirectly.]{.underline} [Professors]{.underline} have [offered
stringent [criticisms]{.mark}]{.underline} of neoliberal society.
[But]{.underline} they have [[**failed to offer**]{.mark} the public
[viable
**alt**]{.mark}]{.underline}ernative**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
this way, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[promoted]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[political
[nihilism]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[set
the stage for]{.mark} new [movements that reject]{.mark}
liberal]{.underline} democratic [principles of tolerance and
institutional [reform]{.mark}.]{.underline} Intellectuals have a long
history of critiquing liberalism, which relies on a "philosophy of
individual rights and (relatively) free markets." Beginning in the 19th
century, according to historian Francois Furet, left-wing thinkers began
to arrive at a consensus "that modern liberal democracy was threatening
society with dissolution because it atomized individuals, made them
indifferent to public interest, weakened authority, and encouraged class
hatred." For most of the 20th century, anti-liberal intellectuals were
able to come up with alternatives. Jean-Paul Sartre famously defended
the Soviet Union even when it became clear that Joseph Stalin was a mass
murderer. French, American, Indian, and Filipino university radicals
were hopelessly enamored of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution in the
1970s. The collapse of Communism changed all this. [Some]{.underline}
[leftist [intellectuals]{.mark} began to [find hope in small]{.mark}
[revolutionary]{.mark} guerrilla[s]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Third
World, like Mexico's Subcomandante Marcos. [Others fell back on pure
critique. [Academics]{.mark} are now mostly gadflies who [rarely offer
strategies]{.mark} for political change. [Those who do]{.mark} forward
alternatives [propose ones]{.mark} so [vague or divorced from
reality]{.mark} that they might as well be proposing
nothing]{.underline}. (The Duke University professor of romance studies
Michael Hardt, for example, thinks the evils of modern globalization are
so pernicious that only worldwide love is the answer.) [[Such thinking
promotes]{.mark} political [hopelessness.]{.mark} It rejects gradual
change as cosmetic, while patronizing those who think otherwise. This
[nihilism]{.mark} **easily [spreads from the classroom]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} academic [[journals to]{.mark} op-ed pages to
Zuccotti Park, and]{.underline} eventually to [[the public]{.mark} at
large.]{.underline} For academic nihilists, the shorthand for the
world's evils is "neoliberalism." The term is used to refer to a free
market ideology that forced globalization on people by reducing the
power of governments. The more the term is used, however, the more it
becomes a vague designation for all global drudgery. Democratic politics
in the age of neoliberalism, according to Harvard anthropologists Jean
and John Comaroff, is "something of a pyramid scheme: the more it is
indulged, the more it is required." [[They argue]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[our belief]{.mark}]{.underline} that [we can use
laws]{.underline} and constitutional processes [to defend our rights
[is]{.mark} a form of "fetishism" that is ultimately "chimerical."
For]{.underline} the University of Chicago literary theorist Lauren
[Berlant]{.underline}, the democratic pursuit of happiness amid
neoliberalism is [nothing but ["cruel optimism."]{.mark} The materialist
things that people desire are "actually an obstacle to your
flourishing,]{.underline}" she writes. [According to this logic, we are
trapped by our own ideologies. It is this logic that allows left-wing
thinkers to implicitly side with British nativists in]{.underline} their
[condemnation of the EU. The radical website Counterpunch]{.underline},
for example, [describes the EU as a "neoliberal prison." It]{.underline}
also [views liberals seeking to reform the EU as "coopted by the
right]{.underline} wing and its goals---from the subversion of
progressive economic ideals to neoliberalism, to the enthusiastic
embrace of neoconservative doctrine." Across the Atlantic, [Trump
supporters are singing a similar tune. Speaking to a black, gay,
college-educated Trump supporter]{.underline}, Samantha [Bee was told:
"We've had]{.underline} these [disasters in neoconservatism and
neoliberalism and]{.underline} I think that he \[[Trump]{.underline}\]
[is an alternative]{.underline} to both those paths." The [[academic
nihilists and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trumpists are in
agreement]{.mark} about a key issue: [The system is]{.mark}
fundamentally [broken]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [liberals who believe in
working patiently toward change are weak.]{.underline} For the
Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos, "indifference" is the
"the hallmark of political liberalism." Since liberals balance different
interests and rights, Santos writes, they have no permanent friends or
foes. He proposes that the world needs to "revive the friend/foe
dichotomy." And in a profane way, it has: modern political movements pit
Americans against Muslims, Britain against Europe, a dictatorial
government against criminals. Unfortunately, [[academic anti-liberalism
is not confined to the West]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Cornell political
scientist Benedict Anderson once described liberal democracy in the
Philippines as a "Cacique Democracy," dominated by feudal landlords and
capitalist families. In this system, meaningful reform is difficult,
since the country's political system is like a "well-run casino," where
tables are rigged in favor of oligarch bosses. [Having a nihilist streak
myself, I]{.underline} once [echoed Anderson]{.underline} [when I
chastised Filipino nationalists for projecting "hope onto spaces within
an elite democracy." Like Anderson, I offered no
alt]{.underline}ernative. [The alt]{.underline}ernative
[arrived]{.underline} recently [in]{.underline} the guise of the
[Duterte, the new president of the Philippines. Like Anderson and me,
Duterte complained about the impossibility of real change in a democracy
dominated by elites and oligarchs]{.underline}. But [unlike us, he
proposed a way out: a strong political leader who was willing to kill to
save the country]{.underline} from criminals and corrupt politicians.
The [spread of global illiberalism is unlikely to end soon. As this
crisis unfolds, we]{.underline} will [need intellectuals who use their
intellects for more than simple negation]{.underline}---professors like
the late New York University historian Tony Judt, who argued that
European-style social democracy could save global democracy. [Failing
that, [we need]{.mark} academics who acknowledge]{.underline} that
[[liberal democracy]{.mark}, [though]{.mark} slow and [imperfect,
enables a bare minimum of tolerance]{.mark} in a world beset [by
xenophobia and hatred]{.mark}. For [although **academics have the luxury
of imagining a completely different world, the rest** ]{.mark}**of us
[have to figure out what to do with the one we
have]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Political nihilism feeds right wing populism -- institutional engagement is key to transform leftist politics

**Churchard 19** (Adam Churchard, PhD student in the Department of

[Distrust in political elites and institutions has become a defining
element of 21st century politics]{.underline} throughout the west. [This
trend has been most successfully harnessed by right wing populists,
who]{.underline} claim to [**represent the anger of the masses and
represent their 'true interests', in the face of a greedy and out of
touch liberal political class**.]{.underline} While in no way am I
attempting to reduce the victories of those such as [Donald Trump,
Marine Le Pen, or Rob Ford]{.underline}, to solely this, [appropriating
anger toward elites has been critical to their political success. The
failure by much of the left to offer a more effective response to these
trends has been disheartening]{.underline} (to say the least). Moreover,
it is why Hilary Wainwright's latest book, [[A New Politics from the
Left]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cambridge, UK: Polity Press), [[represents a
timely appeal for a democratic, participatory, and bottom-up political
transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Wainwright has spent her career
exploring democratic accountability across institutions, and as a
co-editor of the socialist, feminist, and green Red Pepper magazine.
Drawing upon her experiences as an academic and advocate, Wainwright
forcefully argues that [we need to reorganize political power so that it
can be wielded by regular people, giving them the tools to positively
change their lives and communities.]{.underline} A New Politics from the
Left is a short read, and not theoretically dense. What it offers is [a
straightforward and accessible overview of the political
change]{.underline} that Wainwright is calling for. She begins by
challenging the notions of both the technocratic, elite knowledge of the
state, and the individualized knowledge of the free market, with its own
technocratic logic of profit extraction, as sources upon which to base
public decision making. Instead, she argues that [we should look to the
sort of practical and tacit knowledge which is practiced and produced by
social movements, in particular the women's, radical shop stewards', and
green movement.]{.underline} Sharing Knowledge For Wainwright, [these
movements "illustrated, in the way they organized, how this tacit
knowledge might be shared... they are capable of purposeful and planned
action, through collaboration and without predictive certainty,
constantly subject to further experiment and
self-reflexivity"]{.underline} (p. 8-9). She contrasts the paternal
concept of "power as domination," where political leaders tell people
what they need and then implement it, with ["power as transformative
capacity," **where policy ideas and implementation come from the
everyday knowledge of those most impacted**.]{.underline} Wainwright
notes [**the utilization of "power as transformative capacity**" growing
in Britain out of feminist movements, as well as community
organizations, in the 1960s. Instead of having a governing party do
something on their behalf, these groups engaged in action with its own
directly transformative capacity. They rejected traditional deference to
authority, and sought to democratize knowledge, "breaking from models
that presume an expert leadership and more or less ignorant membership,"
and emphasizing popular education]{.underline} (p. 19). [The collective
self-confidence of people to take control of the conditions of their
lives has also]{.underline}, according to Wainwright, [played out within
the Labour Party itself, such as the 1945 government, and again in 1973
-- though in ambiguous, contradictory, and temporary ways. The
relationship between bottom up change and existing political
institutions is explored]{.underline} more fully as the book develops.
Wainwright powerfully illustrates the sort of positive political project
she is advocating through [three key examples.]{.underline} She
describes [the push in the 1970s by Lucas Aerospace workers who, facing
massive job cutbacks and restructuring, **developed a detailed plan to
nationalize and reconfigure the company toward applying the technology
for socially useful purposes.**]{.underline} While the plan received the
support of then-Industry Secretary Tony Benn, corporate pressure and the
1979 defeat of Labour meant it was never implemented. She also describes
[the successful pushback by Newcastle municipal IT workers in 1999 when
the City Council considered contracting their work to a private firm.
They successfully campaigned against privatization, and instead created
an alternative strategy to improve the service based on maximizing
public benefit.]{.underline} Finally, Wainwright looks at [the growth of
digital space, and its utilization to create new democratic spaces, such
as 'platform co-operatives' as an alternative to the 'platform
capitalism' of companies like Uber.]{.underline} These examples work to
illustrate how [positive alternatives to neoliberalism can be developed
from a bottom up, participatory capacity, through everyday shared
knowledge. More than just resisting, these examples developed new forms
of social relations beyond austerity and market logic.]{.underline}
Wainwright's examples are well chosen, in particular her [discussion of
democratic digital spaces is a refreshing counter note to the abhorrent
tech ventures of Silicon Valley, which continually find new ways to use
technology to further exploit and profit from the most vulnerable. Role
of the State]{.underline} One point I would like to raise about [these
examples]{.underline} though, is that they [all sought to turn the state
into a positive ally.]{.underline} In the remainder of the book,
Wainwright argues that **[to develop 'power as transformative capacity',
the state's 'power as domination' is a necessary condition for its full
realization]{.underline}**. I agree with Wainwright that [state
institutions can be used, "where the balance of political power is
favourable, to pursue social goals"]{.underline} (p. 76). I think **[it
is important to work to elect left governments that will enable social
transformation.]{.underline}** That being said, [positive
transformational change is also possible through a more adversarial
approach with state actors.]{.underline} Moreover, sometimes it is
necessary.

Performances of Firearm Ownership in the Long Civil Rights Movement.

While [[guns]{.underline}]{.mark} function by projecting a small piece
of metal into flesh, they can, alternately, [[work in performative ways
that draw on centuries of fabricated and exaggerated racialized
threat.]{.underline}]{.mark} This becomes particularly clear in examples
like those discussed above, where gun legislation, both pro- and
anti-gun control, is [[used to subjugate Black communities. The gun
control legislation of the 1960s and 1970s was in direct response to
armed Black resistance; scholars have argued that earlier pro-gun
legislation supported state militias that participated first in slave
patrols and later,]{.underline}]{.mark} following emancipation, in the
continued oppression of newly freed Black Americans.3 [[These imagined
threats comprise some of the material archive that guns contain,
preserving a racialized past while simultaneously providing potential
futures. When those futures are so closely tied to violence perpetrated
by firearms, it can create a dire situation]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed.
While the militarization of US American culture has accelerated in the
mid- to latetwentieth century[[, the militarized surveillance and
control of Black bodies in North America has been underway since long
before the United States of America was founded]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Browne 2015). It is this pernicious effect of militarization that is
often elided, as Catherine Lutz suggests. "Militarization is intimately
connected not only to the obvious increase in the size of armies and
resurgence of militant nationalisms and militant fundamentalisms," she
argues, "but also the less visible deformation of human potentials into
the hierarchies of race, class, gender, and sexuality, and to the
shaping of national histories in ways that glorify and legitimate
military action" (Lutz 2002:723). The long history of gun rights in the
United States---who can openly perform the right to carry a firearm and
whom the armed person is threatening---has functioned as a
state-sponsored tool aiding in this project of deformation, even as the
gun performs its own meanings and contains its own histories and
futures.

['War,']{.underline} such a common term in the global lexicon, [is
arguably among the least rigorously theorized]{.underline} and most

(and often obsessively) [**dislocating its localities of violence to

mobilizations** of the legitimated excesses of [the racist state **in an
orchestrated violence**]{.mark} that is **no less fatal than that of
actual civil war?**]{.underline} My concern in this essay is with
contextualizing and resituating the profound state and state-ordained
violences of those proliferating [warfare
technologies]{.mark} **that have been rendered mundane, acceptable, and
banal within the nuances of the American
'domestic' social **[formation]{.underline} in the late 20th and early
21st centuries. More precisely, I wish to bring analytical and
theoretical attention to **t**he organized human
fatalities and orchestrated subjections of **racially
pathologized social subjects** that are essential to white supremacist
nation- building, even and especially within the historical conjuncture
of the multiculturalist racist state's emergence as the hegemonic
institutional phenotype of the USA. Thus, what might a radical
sociology, antiracist praxis, and social theory contribute to a critical
reframing of the white supremacist state as something that has neither
obsolesced nor decomposed, as if simply a relic of an earlier, vulgar
moment in US racial formation (Omi and Winant 1994),1
but has reinvigorated and recomposed its animus of dominance through a
symbiosis of multiculturalist incorporations/empowerments and political
enhancement of a statecraftthat is durably and foundationally racist? --
Here, I follow scholar activist and political geographer Ruthie
Gilmore's clarifying definition of racism as 'the state-sanctioned
and/or extra-legal production and exploitation of group-differentiated
vulnerabilities to premature death' (Gilmore 2002: 261).

In spite of, or perhaps because of, the recent proliferation
of 'antiwar' liberal and progressive discourses challenging the
militarized US global regime of the Bush Administration's War on Terror,
the circumstances, scenes, and locations of warfare have been
insidiously periodized and re-sited -- not incidentally by the 'antiwar'
left itself -- to the **nominal historical and geographic exteriors of
the USA.** There is
[a **political-discursive **circuit bridging]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
extra-national and **[globalmilitary mobilizations]{.mark} of the US
state,** including its knowledge-producing and violence-enhancing
techniques, **and the loyal** opposition and dissension of
the establishment US left to a state-induced global 'war' that it
alleges is being conducted under false, flawed, or immoral pretensions.
The energy conducted by this political-discursive circuit (as with all
functioning circuits) reproduces each of the nominally opposed elements
of its bridge while, uniquely, generating bodies **of [social
thought]{.mark}** (embodied by scholars, pundits, activists, state
figures, and public media forms) **and [political
performances]{.mark}** (rallies, 'antiwar'
agendas/manifestos, [and]{.mark} rituals of [public]{.mark} debate) that
instruct a particular common sense of what 'war' is.

[[This common sense obscures and]{.mark} consistently **disavows
the material continuities between state-formed [technologies of
warmaking]{.mark} **]{.underline}across historical moments and geog-
raphies, while[ **re-forming the US 'Homeland' as a place of relative
'peace'** -- or at least as a place that is not at war -- wherein
state-produced and state-proctored institutionalizations of massive
racist violence are **unrecognizable as such**, and articulations
of]{.underline} the current emergencies of domestic warfare -- e.g. by
prison and penal abolitionists (Critical Resistance Publications
Collective 2000), radical women of color antiviolence activists (INCITE!
Women of Color Against Violence 2006), andimprisoned radicals
and revolutionaries (Hames-Garcia 2004; Rodríguez 2006) -- are held with
suspicion as the allegations of those (simply) unwilling to concede
thefundamental tenability and universal reformability of the US social
and state forms. I am thus addressing a modality of war that is most
often contained and disappeared into the categorically unremarkable:
that which is so taken-for-granted, assumed so organic to the production
of the social landscape, that it is quite literally not worthy of
extended remark, much less sustained critical comment or analysis. As
such, this historical present is a warfare mosaic that
refuses simplifying categorization precisely because its composition
absorbs the identification of its observers, and (following Althusser's
formulation) 'hails' social subjects with individualizing narratives of
national vindication. The discursive techniques of this
war subsume regularly available, locally recognizable artifacts of
martial law (e.g. announced and valorized police roundups of 'gangs' and
'illegal aliens'), a racist police state (euphemized as 'racial
profiling'), and deeply political or proto-political civil
insurrection (e.g. rioting, cop assassination, and property
destruction) under the rubrics of law, policing, justice, and (most
importantly) 'peace' or 'peacekeeping'.[ In the context of this

Scholars of Black geographies activate conversations around the ways and
practices that Blackness is experienced, negotiated, and shaped in and
through space and place, with the foreknowledge that these landscapes
are "shaped by the histories of colonialism, transatlantic slavery,
contemporary practices of racism, and resistances to white supremacy"
(McKittrick, 2011: vi). [[Black geographies]{.underline}]{.mark} are
characterized as being alterable, transnational, dialogical, materially
(or economically) related to racial capitalism1 , and they accentuate
Black people and Black culture (McKittrick, 2006; Robinson, 1983; Woods,
1998; Buroway, 1998; McKittrick, Ed., 2015). These characteristics
[[challenge]{.mark} ontologies and epistemologies of [Eurocentric,
ahistorical, and white supremacist ways of learning, teaching, and
creating new knowledges,]{.mark} without pathologizing both Blackness
and how it is operationalized within spatial processes]{.underline}
(McKittrick, 2006; McKittrick and Woods, 2007; Solórzano and Yosso,
2002; Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva, 2008). [[The question remains on the
necessity to create and alter methodologies]{.mark} in a way that aligns
with the overall foci of Black geographic research and its ability [to
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} data collected by way of a [[white
normative gaze and/or white supremacist
epistemologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the research that has inspired
the formation of this Black geographical methodology, I seek to build
grounded theory by discovering the lesser-known epistemologies nestled
within the counternarratives2 of my research participants, in order to
best examine the relationship between Black millennial intersectional
identities3 and their spatial practices and behaviors. If "Black matters
are spatial matters" (McKittrick, 2006: vi), I situate this line of
inquiry around Atlanta's rapidlychanging racial, political, and urban
landscape, drawing upon my own cultural intuition and sensitivity
(Solórzano and Yosso, 2001:12) as a Black, college-educated, childless
millennial living in Atlanta for a decade. In order to answer this
question, I make a case for a [[Black geographical methodology as a
means to understand]{.underline}]{.mark} 1) [the relational nature of
[Blackness and space as pertinent to]{.mark} understanding the ways in
which Black millennials [engage in the production of
space]{.mark}]{.underline}, 2) [[how Black spaces are produced within a
changing socio-spatial landscape, and]{.underline}]{.mark} 3) [[how we
can imagine Black spatial futures that are not limited to urbanity, but
related to it.]{.underline}]{.mark} This paper is not about the findings
of the research but rather a contribution to methodologies in [[Black
geographies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[center Blackness and the role of
Blacknesses]{.underline}]{.mark}4 [[in navigating, interpreting, and
participating in the contestation of space, while disrupting white
interpretations]{.mark} of America's racialized landscape. [Applying a
methodology specifically developed with Black geographies]{.mark} in
mind [has a unique potential to contribute greatly to the process of
understanding the ways that Black folks are creating, maintaining, or
altering the physical]{.mark} and conceptual [places]{.mark} in which
they live. Geographers have utilized [the term,
"place-making]{.mark}]{.underline},\"5 for decades [[and describe it as
a process]{.mark} which involves enacting, performing, engaging in
practices [that shape how people experience and relate to place. It is
imperative to articulate place-making practices across identity
intersections, thus inspiring methodologies devoted to examining Black
geographies. If spaces consist of multiple and varying socio-cultural
spheres]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fraser, 1990), [[it is vital for scholars
to move beyond scholarship based on a white "sense of place," or in
other words, a white valuation and interpretation of space, that
dominates some socio-spatial theories and renderings of spatial
relationality and realities.]{.underline}]{.mark} An alterable,
multi-spheric, and humanistic approach to studying [[Black geographies
suggests]{.mark} that scholars explore the ways in which space and place
are being altered and [how Black folks are reforming and refining our
interpretations of]{.mark} contemporary spatial theories, [practices,
and praxis within a Black geographic framework]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Black geographic study]{.underline}]{.mark} and Black
[[mobilities]{.underline}]{.mark} that galvanize [[a new way to
study]{.underline}]{.mark} the urban and its inhabitants [[in
"narratives that think through and across humanness, location, and
knowledge"]{.underline}]{.mark} (McKittrick, Ed., 2015: 12). In this
collaborative work, [[Wynter suggests that scholarship, rooted in the
relationality of humanness, has the ability to capture the complexities
of and within the collective and the individual narrative. Thus, spaces
of knowledge production and articulation are desperately in need of
assistance in de-nebulizing Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} (read:
Blacknesses) and middleclassness and [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
considering [[how]{.underline}]{.mark} a multiplicity of [[identities
intersect one another within and across spaces]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Wynter's theory of being human as praxis aligns with Soja's (1980)
theory that the social and the spatial are dialectical. The relational
nature of the social, spatial, and human (behaviors, motivation,
emotions, symbols, etc.) [[is essential to discovering the depths and
multiplicities of]{.underline}]{.mark} urban [[actors within an
ever-changing]{.underline}]{.mark} urbanizing [[society that is both
fixed and fluid]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bearing this in mind, my Black
geographical methodology situates Black humanity and Black spatial and
aspirational imaginaries within the milieu of Black place-making
practices, across multiple and additive identity intersections. A
humanistic geographical approach is pertinent to keep from continuing
practices that dehumanize already contested and historically
marginalized bodies by over-emphasizing discussion on space and place.
[[This framework is integral to shedding light on how coming-of-age
Black millennial adults are affecting the perception, production, and

data that are embedded within cross-generational stories and aspirations
within a racialized landscape. In order to ensure that human geography
remains human-centered in this project, a humanistic geography approach
is imperative not only in the creation of data collection protocols and
analysis, but also in the thought, preparation, and practice of research
conducted across cognitive, relational, emotional, logical, sensory,
symbolic, and behavioral dimensions of humanity (Sapkota, 2017).
Humanistic geographers focus on humans and relationality, and must be
careful not to objectify the humanity of the participant by reducing the
person or the data to just an "abstract study of space and structures"
(125). Sapkota (2017) describes "sense of place" as the nexus where
behavior, motivations, belongings/unbelonging and spatial practice
collide: "\...an individual awareness of the 'spirit' or identity of a
place" (24). [[This idea about sense of place coincides with Tuan's
point that place is materialized out of space based on familiarity and
valuation]{.underline}]{.mark} (1977:6, 18), [[making it possible for
white supremacist structures to infringe on nonwhite senses of place
that do not align with an inherent cultivation of white placefulness
and/or Black placelessness]{.underline}]{.mark} (McKittrick, 2006).
[[Black placelessness is diasporic in its foundation through centuries
of race projects of displacement, concealment, and marginalization that
seek to render the Black body as "ungeographic"]{.mark} (McKittrick,
2006: x): [from the international slave trade to redlining to mass
incarceration of Black and Brown bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paper
operates as an intervention to the white spatial and theoretical gaze,
focusing on Black-placefulness to show how Blackness is integral in the
production of space.6 [[Counter-narratives and histories play a poignant
role in the dismantling of white epistemological approaches in the study
of people, place, and history]{.underline}]{.mark}. Solórzano and Yosso
(2002) term "critical race methodology" as an applied mechanism of
critical race theory. [[This methodology centers the study of
race]{.mark}, gender, class, [etc. in scholarship, with the intention of
destabilizing racist, classist, and sexist oppressive societal
structures by prioritizing personal experience and knowledge of people
of color within critical race scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline} (25).
[[By centering the lived experience of people of color and their
identities with regard to their individual and collective history,
critical race methodology recognizes these stories as theoretical,
methodological and pedagogical tools to challenge institutional
practices and ideologies]{.mark} that support racism, classism, sexism,
and other intersections]{.underline} (26). Michelle V. Rowley (2013)
further supports the importance of narratives---specifically
genealogical narratives---that create [[a sense of belonging for the
narrator and also illustrate how genealogies transcend time and
space]{.underline}]{.mark} (78). Making space for counter-narrative data
was an important part of the development of this methodology, as
counter-narrative data not only has the potential to reflect spatiality,
but can also connect spatially-embedded collection practices to
behaviors, identity formation, and renderings of various types of
Blackness.

subconscious place-making practices---tensions, conflicts, and
negotiations that emerge in the counter-narratives of the in-home and
roving interviews. I have developed this methodology specifically for
asking questions about place and sense of place in Black geographies.
The immersive "tours" I have discussed are a means to confront white
normativity within space, while also understanding the relationship
between Black identity and Black spatiality with regard to practices of
resistance, concepts of social and physical safety, and identity
construction (individual and collective). The methodology that I present
in this paper provides a means to gain key insights into Black
placefulness in and across other identity intersections that surface
within the racial and historical fabric of America and, more
specifically, in Atlanta, Georgia. The broader impacts of this paper are
to inspire the further questioning of epistemologies and incite more
conversations around creating methodologies that actively contrast white
normative and white-centered methodologies rooted in white spatial
epistemologies. Applying these methods, which [[center on the
overlapping of Black histories, generational traumas, and practices of
empathy]{.underline}]{.mark} into the data collection process, [[is key
in building and maintaining trust. This trust not only centers the
narrative of the participant to the research]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
it also serves as a site of catharsis: [[the participant is encouraged
to and can speak freely about a subject that is often concealed or
suppressed, sometimes to protect oneself, one's peace, and one's sense
of place. This is particularly valuable in a landscape where Black
placefulness, individually and collectively, is constantly being
altered, navigated, and contested by whiteness.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Black geographies]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly in calls from
Woods (2002) and McKittrick (2011), [[encourage scholars to focus on
black life and agency within and despite white
supremacy.]{.underline}]{.mark} McKittrick (2011: 948), specifically,
calls for an 'analytics of race based not in suffering, but on human
life', expressing a vision of black geographies that need not be based
explicitly on black suffering or set directly in contrast to whiteness.
This call pushes scholars to not simply let their research become
'descriptors of social ills' (Wright, 2017: 2) but [[to focus on black
lives, drawing attention to what is invisibilized in the academy and
society: black knowledges, black excellence, and black lived
experiences.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is not to claim whiteness, white
supremacy, and/or white privilege do not provide important and inherent
context for black lives, black experiences, or black geographies. As
Neville et al. (2015) [have argued, the desire for and expression of
affirmative black identities in part stems from oppressive regimes that
negatively stereotype and at times invisibilize blackness. [Instead,
black geographies provide an opportunity for a focus on affirmative
black identities and affirmative black geographies that celebrate black
life even as black communities resist a racist
society.]{.mark}]{.underline} Bledsoe (2017), for example, explains how
the spatial practice of marronage by Afrodescendent communities in
Brazil and the United States has been a way of producing socio-spatial
autonomy through the creation of 'entirely new spatial relations that do
not draw on modern spatial praxes as the norm' (Bledsoe, 2017: 34).
[[Black radical thought]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Tyner (2006,
2007), [[was/is geographical in its rejection of both segregation and
integration and articulation of a different spatial vision that Tyner
calls 'communal separatism']{.underline}]{.mark} (Tyner, 2007: 226).
[[These studies do not just challenge marginalizing articulations of
society and space but also highlight articulations developed within
black diasporic communities. Black geographies also include an openness
to non-traditional geographic sources, including not only the spectacle
performance but also mundane, everyday enactments of black
geographies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Films, literary fiction, art, music,
and other forms of expressive acts have been usefully incorporated into
studies (Forman, 2000; McKittrick, 2000a, 2000b, 2006; Woods, 1998), and
parades, protests, and cultural festivals display powerful collective
spatial expressions (Anderson, 2015; Crutcher Jr., 2010; McCann, 1999;
O'Reilly and Crutcher, 2006; Waterman, 1998). In addition, [[more
mundane expressive acts found in]{.mark} everyday dress or [speech,
along with other practices, can provide insights into the
differentiation of black geographies,]{.mark} helping to dispel
monolithic assumptions of a singular black community]{.underline}

In what follows, [[we examine two key conceptual frames used in the
geography of race -- landscape and place -- with the intention of
understanding their relative strengths for examining the articulated
focus of black geographies]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 We suggest that
cultural landscape analysis has been and continues to be an influential
and productive approach to geographies of race and has served as a
particular line of entry for studies of race and geography. We argue
that this lens is limited in its ability to attend to black geographies
in a society that works to invisibilize blackness and black
contributions. We follow our examination of landscape with [[an
articulation of relational place-making and suggest that this conceptual
lens enables the examination of a greater plurality of practices and
strategies of producing and claiming space and place. A deeper
engagement with theorizations of place, we argue, enables clearer
meanings and contrasts, and provides a productive framework through
which to identify and explain]{.mark} epistemological and ontological

A second intellectual strategy involves unsettling [[assumptions about
''the international'' by displacing what are usually assumed to be key
elements]{.mark} [(like state sovereignty) or key
actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (like the United Nations) [[from the center
of analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some scholars, such as Te´treault and
Lipschutz (2009), begin their understanding of the international ''as if
people mattered.'' [They foreground [human experiences of violence and
poverty, political action and cultural renewal, in spaces not confined
by nation-state boundaries; they imagine political communities beyond
foreign policy and the norms of international
organizations.]{.mark}]{.underline} What makes this a potentially
decolonial exercise is their insistence on starting their thinking about
the international not with academic theories but with the disparate,
messy, not-always-logical, and immensely rich realm of human life. Other
scholars such as Meghana Nayak and Eric Selbin take this a step further
by combining [[a critical perspective on IR's dominant theoretical
regime with a strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[decenters IR and
re-imagines international politics through different cultural,
geopolitical, and epistemological places]{.mark}]{.underline} (2010).
They aim to ''unsettle, relativize and provincialize IR'' in order to
''politicize the world, what is done to make that world endure and the
effects of what we do about it'' (2010: 10). [[This not only serves to
facilitate the introduction of new cultural norms and worldviews but
also provides a critical vista on the ''core'' from a subordinated place
on the geopolitical map.]{.mark} [Theorizing Latin America through the
coloniality of power might contribute to these initiatives by displacing
the core business of conventional IR in several key
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, it is the natural inclination of
coloniality scholarship to theorize ''as if people mattered,''
[[especially those most oppressed by colonialism----the indigenous and
Afro-descendant communities.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, taking
seriously the political agency and worldview of subaltern peoples lies
at the heart of the decolonial strategies proposed by coloniality
scholarship. It draws particular inspiration from the Mexican Zapatista
movement (Mignolo 2005), the struggles for dignity and intercultural
education in Ecuador (Walsh 2002), and Afro-Colombian organization
(Escobar, 2004). Moreover, while coloniality scholarship is plugged into
intellectual networks and movements in ''First World'' universities,
this approach foregrounds the writings of Latin American intellectuals,
such as Cuban antiimperialist Jose´ Martı´ and Peruvian Juan Carlos
Maria´tegui (Moran˜a et al., 2008). Martı´'s anti-imperialist
celebration of Latin America and Maria´tegui's adaptation of Marxism to
indigenous Andean realities were driven by lived experiences of social
injustice, racism, and the struggle for political autonomy. That is,
coloniality scholars are not only writing ''as if people mattered'' but
as if particular, colonized people mattered, and as such, as if
colonialism, slavery,

[We are haunted by the specter of civil war.]{.underline} Liberal and
conservative politicians and [commentators openly express anxiety about
the]{.underline} possibility of outright hostilities and the
["unravelling \[of \] our national fabric"]{.underline} (Gambino 2017).
[[Increasing polarization, identity politics]{.mark} that destroys
persuasion]{.underline}, an atmosphere of conspiracy regarding the deep
state or foreign puppet masters, apparent disenchantment with
institutions, general mistrust in electoral politics, [[a
gridlocked]{.mark} and weak [congress, and]{.mark} open [skirmishes
between white nationalist]{.mark} and antifascists are [put
forth]{.mark} as [signs of the end times]{.mark}]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Blight 2017; Wright 2017; DeGroot 2018; Smith 2018). [[The looming
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} of the end of politics
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} everywhere [[drives the nostalgic desire for
a return to a normal]{.mark}cy and [civility invites us to rethink
debate]{.mark}]{.underline} and to pose a different question that does
not seek to redeem a past that never was and continues to come at too
high a cost for the wretched of the earth. [[Rather than "make debate
great again," I'd like to]{.underline}]{.mark} sit with the vertigo so
as to consider debate's (im)possible outside. Such a quest for a horizon
that is before-after-immanent to the End (of politics or history or the
world) will require that we [[rethink the spatiotemporal
coordinates]{.mark} of the entire liberal project that secures the
parameters [of debate]{.mark}]{.underline} as the dialectical and
agonistic contestation of the possible. [My central interlocutor here
will be blackness]{.underline}: that (non-)ontological constitutive
outside of the modern grammar that is relegated to the realm of absolute
necessity, negativity, incapacity, and pathology that subtends the
political and the rhetorical. As that which is always already outside
the World/History, [[blackness provides an anoriginary nonplace from
which to think crisis]{.mark} and a politics of [actualizing the
impossible.]{.mark} Imminent civil war is an interesting but
unsurprising anxiety]{.underline}; it is unsurprising because the U.S.
Civil War informs so much of the popular narrative of the United States
and its ethical position that confirms the progressive nature of time,
and because liberal sovereignty was always a war waged against civil
war.1 And it is interesting because the Greeks referred to civil war as
"stasis." Today standing, state, and stability are also meanings of
stasis, as it emerges from histemi. [[Stasis]{.mark} then doubles both
as sovereignty and as sovereignty's undoing and [evokes a constant
permanence of war even in peace]{.mark}.]{.underline} Stasis in
rhetorical studies takes on the meaning of "issue" and serves as a
hermeneutic for coming to consensus on the point of contention from
which debate proceeds. Stasis here also means standing in the sense that
there is some "ground" in the form of prior consensus on the nature of
the disagreement.2 [[The]{.mark} somewhat [paradoxical relationship
between consensus and dissensus]{.mark} found [in stasis speaks to
a]{.mark} kind of [disavowal of ungroundedness that precedes]{.mark}
even [the point from which to begin speaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. Must
one have a presupposed potentiality for a common ground to be able to
proceed in argument? Refusing this disavowal of groundlessness as it
emerges in contemporary [[figurations of]{.mark} agonistic [debate might
enable us to more accurately think of rhetoric]{.mark} in its modern
inflection as the presupposition of a ground [as a war against
its]{.mark} [own void via antiblackness.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
inversion of Clausewitz's proposition is salient: [[rhetoric is the
continuation of war]{.mark} by other means; rhetoric [as]{.mark} a mode
of war in [an effort to ontologize]{.mark} itself [against its
groundless outside]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 [[The (im)possible is always
at stake in debate since rhetoric regards the contingent as its
necessary presupposition]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to Dilip
Gaonkar, this "key, but largely unnoticed, assumption in contemporary
rhetorical theory" finds its basis in Aristotle's response to Plato's
charge of the unspecifiability of rhetoric (2004, 5). Instead of freeing
us to reflect explicitly on the nature of contingency, Aristotle's
domestication of rhetoric by placing rhetoric within the domain of the
"contingent, yet probable" has prompted most rhetorical scholars to
forgo consideration of contingency in favor of the thematic of
probability: doxa, constraints, norms, ideology. Contingency in these
schemas tends to be considered as a property ascribed to statements,
propositions, and rhetorical acts---to the ontic world that constitutes
the context of the rhetor---rather than as a mode of the subject or the
singular encounter that constitutes a rhetorical situation.
[[The]{.mark} possibility of [rhetorical]{.mark} [dialectic]{.mark},
that exigency that provides the opportunity for agonistic argument that
can be sublated into judgment, animates historical progress and [places
debate as the ground for civic life. In]{.mark}]{.underline} the liberal
understanding of [[contemporary debate, contingency takes on an
interior]{.underline}]{.mark} spatial dimension [as]{.underline} the
[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark} content [[through a disavowal
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the contingency of [[debate's outside that is
rendered impossible. To say that debate is impossible]{.mark} is then to
beckon to war on the horizon. It [is to recognize the state of emergency
as the end of the state of debate.]{.mark}]{.underline} The historical
legacy of the U.S. Civil War will not let us end it there however,
because blackness haunts even civil war, and threatens stasis in both
its senses with incoherence. To leave raciality by the wayside is to
repeat the endless disavowal that what we are threatened with is civil
war and not race war. It is to still recuperate this World though the
dialectical resolution that can adjust antagonism to agonism. It is to
wage liberal sovereignty's war against civil war all over again**.**
[[Polite discussions that acknowledge racial terror only]{.mark} so as
[to explain away racial violence]{.mark} as the unique domain of
extremists [maintain]{.mark} a sense of [white innocence that not only
individuates a structural condition, but also pathologizes and prohibits
black utterance]{.mark} (especially when that utterance might take on
the form of rage) [by adjusting the impossible demands of blackness back
to the acceptable terms of debate. Within such discussions, blackness
can only appear as an afterthought]{.mark}]{.underline}, as what Denise
Ferreira da Silva terms the affectable I or outer-determined rather than
self-determined subject in the onto-epistemological modern text (da
Silva 2007). Raciality is intrinsic to modernity because it is necessary
for the construction of the Subject---it names the materialization of
the spatiotemporal forms that make the modern grammar. It creates the
grounds for the self-determined subject. For da Silva, nothing short of
a fracturing of the spatiotemporal formal principles of understanding
that subtend historical and scientific knowledge will redress the
totality of racial violence, especially as it concerns black folk. Let
us then take seriously Du Bois's insight into the actual U.S. Civil War
that animates so many antiblack pathologies today: that it was the black
slaves, not Lincoln nor the Union, who won the war; and that it was the
slaves, and not the South, who ultimately lost. For it was in the chaos
and crisis of civil war that fugitivity realized freedom only to have it
snatched away in Reconstruction: "The slave went free; stood a brief
moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery. . . . Democracy
died save in the hearts of black folk" (Du Bois 1935, 30). In Black
Reconstruction, we are gifted a tale of the violence of antiblack
dialectic and the potential of black fugitivity. The common narrative
that the North fought a war to end slavery and to preserve the Union
figures the U.S. Civil War as a political battle concerning sovereignty
and succession, or in the radical imagination as a battle for the future
of capital between an industrial North and a pastoral planter economy in
the South. For Du Bois this cannot be the whole or even essential part
of the story, as both narratives naturalize the position of the slave
and her nominal emancipation as derivative rather than active. In Du
Bois's account, black liberation was never the terms on which the war
was fought; the war was fought over competing concerns to limit the
competition that black people posed to whites, both as slave labor and
as free labor. The North for its part desired neither the abolition of
slavery nor its expansion into the western territories. Northerners
desired a resolution to an untenable status quo thrown into
disequilibrium by competing visions for how best to subjugate the black
population to secure the white settlerist way of life. It was not until
the slaves, through the waging of the General Strike, showed the North
the way to win the war that Lincoln reluctantly issued the Emancipation
Proclamation (Du Bois 1935, 82). The General Strike was the moment in
which the impossible was actualized, through an incisive refusal to
continue under the terms presented: "This was not merely the desire to
stop work. It was a strike on a wide basis against the conditions of
work. It was a general strike that involved directly in the end perhaps
a half million people. They wanted to stop the economy of the plantation
system, and to do that they left the plantations" (Du Bois 1935, 68).
Significantly, Du Bois's analysis of the Civil War extends beyond the
Confederacy's surrender in 1865 to the end of Reconstruction and the
beginning of Jim Crow in 1878. The democracy to come was quickly sealed
off in the compromises made between the North and the South that we call
Reconstruction. Here debate, both as contestation on common ground and
as the resolution to war, could only re-elaborate black suffering
through nominal emancipation. In Reconstruction we witness how the
bargain was struck for a newly transformed American whiteness produced
through the sublation of the "Southern way of life" (the fantasy of
which still animates grievances on the Right), but against black life.
The reinstantiation of master-slave relationships in confederate
amnesty, black codes, the Thirteenth Amendment, vagrancy laws, convict
leasing, extralegal terror, and the ongoing sentimental and material
expropriation of total value from the slave that sustains global capital
constitutes the emergence of the "afterlife of slavery" that
characterizes our present (Hartman 1997). Du Bois's analysis disrupts
the spatiotemporal coordinates of the political to think the
(im)possibility of black politics and liberation[. [To think with and
through blackness means that we]{.mark} cannot think the Civil War
as]{.underline} a demarcated event [distinct]{.underline} [from
Reconstruction and Jim Crow, or [think the stasis of contestation
between the divisions of a polity. We must abandon the]{.mark} liberal
[notion of progress that "accumulates . . . \[and\] . . . captures"
black suffering in the name of securing an antiblack future]{.mark} as
well as the appeal of universality and particularity [which]{.mark}
spatially ["arrests Blackness's creative potential"]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Dillon 2013, 42; da Silva 2014, 84). According to da Silva, "such an
understanding of total value \[of slavery for the creation of the
World\] requires a suspension of the view that all there is is in Time
and Space . . . [[the radical force of Blackness lies at the turn of
thought---that is, Blackness knowing and studying announces the End of
the World as we know it]{.underline}]{.mark}" (2014, 84, emphasis mine).
Da Silva joins a growing number of black scholars in many different
disciplinary homes thinking through the metaphysics of blackness as that
which is ungrounded and ontologically null with respect to the modern
onto-epistemological paradigm.4 In the World that ontologizes
antiblackness and racial capitalism, the calculus of racial terror
exceeds and makes possible recognition through the reduction of
blackness to the figure of the Slave. The middle passage here is
metonymic, naming the production of anagrammatical blackness through the
ongoing logistic of being captured and shipped, that reduces blackness
from body to flesh, "that zero degree of social conceptualization that
does not escape concealment under the brush of discourse" (Sharpe 2016;
Spillers 1987, 67). Such a proposition returns raciality, specifically
blackness and antiblackness, to the analysis of what grounds debate's
(im)possibility. [[What would it mean to think debate as a praxis of the
impossible? To think a blackened debate]{.mark} not as the
presupposition of a ground through approximation to an antiblack human
genre of Man]{.underline}, the Subject or the transparent I, [but
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} Harney and Moten say, "[[jurisgenerative black
social life]{.mark}"]{.underline} (2017, 15)? [[We would need to
rethink]{.mark} the cherished terms of [rhetoric itself. We might think
debate not as dialectic that]{.mark} both precedes and [proceeds from
stasis, but]{.mark} [as the refusal of "the call to order" that opens up
black]{.mark} forms of [life]{.mark}, even as form is placed [under
erasure]{.mark}]{.underline} (Halberstam 2013, 9). [[From this vantage
point of blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is not really a vantage
point at all, but a being out of place and time, of Being under erasure
in the condition of mutual dispossession, [[we]{.mark} [might]{.mark}
begin to sketch other visions that deactivate rhetoric's ontologizing
premises, to [hold for a moment]{.mark}, in the hold and in the
wake]{.underline}, not grounded but oceanic movement, decay and life,
where even dead things become something else. [[It is here and happening
all the time]{.mark} in the marooned spaces of the world. [In studying
debate's (im)possibility, we might theorize at the End of the World as a
praxis oriented toward its abolition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

##  Uniqueness

###  Critical Politics General 2NC Uniqueness

#### Base Turnout and New Voter's won't be enough by itself

**Brownstein, 6-4-29** (Robert, CNN Senior Political Analyst, CNN
Politics,
https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/politics/trump-voters-switch-to-democrats-in-2018-2020/index.html)

Even **[comparing 2018 with 2016]{.underline}**, **[more Democrats than
Republicans stayed home]{.underline}**, Catalist found. **[But because
of the turnout gains among key party constituencies, that drop-off was
much less of a problem than it typically is for
Democrats]{.underline}**. About 40% of all voters who participated in
both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections stayed home in the next
midterms; but in 2018, only about 27% of 2016 voters sat out, Catalist
found. Moreover, the mix of voters who fell off last year was less
lopsidedly Democratic than in the past: Republicans also suffered a
drop-off, particularly among non-college whites and rural whites, two of
Trump\'s key groups. Minorities, who usually slip as a share of the
midterm vote, represented almost exactly as much of the vote in 2018 as
they had in 2016. And while young people still declined as a share of
the electorate in 2018, they did not do so nearly as severely as in the
previous two midterm elections. **[The overall result was voters who sat
out the 2018 midterms after voting in 2016 cost the Democrats a
manageable 2 percentage points in the total vote]{.underline}** last
year, only about one-third of their crushing decline in 2014. And last
year, **[Democrats offset that loss through]{.underline}** the other
major factor that shifted the electorate\'s composition: **[new
voters]{.underline}**. Catalist found that about 13% of the 2018 voters,
some 14 million people, had not voted in 2016. That was a significantly
bigger surge of new voters than in 2010 and 2014, when about 9% of the
electorate had not participated in the previous presidential election.
And while the new voters had favored Republicans by 2 percentage points
in 2010 and by a solid 7 percentage points in 2014, they provided
Democrats a resounding advantage of 21 percentage points last year.
**[In]{.underline}** all, Catalist calculated, new voters swelled the
Democrats\' total share of the 2018 vote by about 2.6 percentage points.
When combined with their loss of around 2 percentage points from 2016
voters who sat out **[2018]{.underline}**, that meant changes in the
electorate\'s composition contributed about half a percentage point to
their overall vote gain from the presidential election to the midterm
elections. That was a vast improvement from the midterm elections under
Obama, when Democrats were hurt by the composition of both the drop-off
and new voters. \"**[There was a massive turnout boost that favored
Democrats]{.underline}**, at least compared to past midterms,\" [Ghitza
wrote in a recent Medium piece explaining his
research](https://medium.com/@yghitza_48326/revisiting-what-happened-in-the-2018-election-c532feb51c0).
But **[by itself]{.underline}**, **[that]{.underline}** roughly
half-point **[improvement]{.underline}** in the Democratic vote **[from
changes in the electorate\'s composition would not have been nearly
sufficient to drive the party\'s sweeping gains last
year]{.underline}**. \"**[If turnout was the only factor, then Democrats
would not have seen nearly the gains that they ended up
seeing]{.underline}**,\" Ghitza wrote.

###  Black Voters Key to the Election

#### BLACK VOTER Turn out is Critical to the Democrats Winning the Presidency, 2016 proves that even a 7% decline in Black Voter Turnout Can be Disastrous

queen

A record 137.5 million Americans voted **[[in the 2016 presidential
election,]{.underline}]{.mark}** according to new data from the U.S.
Census Bureau. Overall voter turnout -- defined as the share of adult
U.S. citizens who cast ballots -- was 61.4% in 2016, a share similar to
2012 but below the 63.6% who say they voted in 2008. A number of
long-standing trends in presidential elections either reversed or
stalled in 2016, as **[[black voter turnout decreased, white turnout
increased]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the nonwhite share of the U.S.
electorate remained flat since the 2012 election. Here are some key
takeaways from the Census Bureau's report, the data source with the most
comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters.
**[[The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years
in a presidential election, falling to 59.6% in 2016 after reaching a
record-high 66.6% in 2012]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
7-percentage-point decline from the previous presidential election is
the largest on record for blacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (It's also the
largest percentage-point decline among any racial or ethnic group since
white voter turnout dropped from 70.2% in 1992 to 60.7% in 1996.)
**[[The number of black voters also declined]{.mark}, falling
by]{.underline}** about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016,
**[[representing a sharp reversal from 2012]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With
Barack Obama on the ballot that year, the black voter turnout rate
surpassed that of whites for the first time. Among whites, the 65.3%
turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1% in 2012.

**[In the wake of the general election last year, black women stand out

ballots in November 2018, a full six percentage points above the
national turnout.]{.underline}** At least one **[political expert says
that the presidential candidates will need to demonstrate a commitment
to issues important to this group if they want their party's
nomination.]{.underline}** Among those issues: equal pay and maternal
health, says Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People, a
group seeking to insure black women are part of the national political
conversation. **["If you want to know what the possibilities for this
country are beyond Trump, then listen to black women, who are
extraordinarily engaged, who are following politics, who are the most
likely to vote and bring our communities forward, and to support a
broad-based justice agenda," Allison told Fortune.]{.underline}**
Allison's organization hosted a national political summit that generated
the likes of Democratic U.S. Reps. Barbara Lee of California and Pramila
Jayapal of Washington state, as well as a forum featuring several of the
White House candidates. **["If you enter into a campaign and you don't
already have established relationships with black women in particular,

On Saturday, after a couple of hours in the hair salon --- always a
couple of hours --- the 2020 election started taking shape for me.
Women. Women of color. Black women. I listened to the banter, a lively
combination of speculation about HBO\'s \"Game of Thrones,\" furloughed
federal workers canceling appointments, Women\'s March politics,
President Donald Trump\'s wall and more. One point of agreement: If the
White Walkers can breach the mammoth ice wall across the north of
Westeros, then a wall along our southern border is surely a waste of
money. My salon, and thousands like it across the country, is where the
2020 election will be decided. For Democrats, the quest to win the 2020
primary and general elections flows through the vibrant conversations of
black women on a Saturday morning --- a time and place of unvarnished
truth among women of all classes and life experiences. Ask Hillary
Clinton[: Women of color voted overwhelmingly for her in 2016, including
69 percent of Latino women and 94 percent of black women in the general
election, slightly less than for President Barack Obama in 2012. One big
problem, though. Turnout was down among African-American voters in key
states]{.underline}. To reach the White House, Clinton needed more of
these women in Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. READ: On behalf of
all black women, you\'re welcome, Alabama --- and America » Conversely,
many white women continue to stick with the GOP. President Trump
narrowly won white women in 2016 (it was women of color who gave Clinton
her significant edge with women overall), while the parties ran about
even with them in House elections in 2018. Democrats did manage to peel
away more college-educated white women in the 2018 midterms, some
fertile ground for 2020 growth. [Since the 2016 defeat, it has been the
strength of the black women\'s vote that has driven victories in
statewide and down-ballot races for Democrats --- including the
much-celebrated record number of diverse women in the new
Congress]{.underline}. \[Most read\] FBI raids home of former top
Madigan political operative » [Why are these facts so important for a
crowded 2020 Democratic presidential primary field? Simple --- the
numbers clearly show that the real juice for Democrats rests with women
of color. No candidate can ignore black women in the primary season and
still hope to engage them after winning the party nomination --- that
won\'t fly. Black women are the most reliable base of the Democratic
Party. To win this base in the primary, and then fully mobilize it in a
general election, the candidates will need to listen to the women in the
hair salons.]{.underline} In 2020, some may write off identity politics,
but for many women/women of color/black women, identity is politics.
When black women think of the wage gap, they know that they make 63
cents for every dollar made by their white male counterparts. (For
Latino women, it\'s 54 cents; for white women, it\'s 79 cents.) When
black women consider their health care, they experience that their
sisters and mothers die of breast and cervical cancer, heart disease and
diabetes at greater rates than white women and that their fertility is
impacted disproportionately by uterine fibroids, premature delivery and
inadequate access to reproductive care. When black women look at their
economic prospects, they know they stare down over \$10,000 more in
college debt than white men do --- overall, women hold about \$400
billion more in college debt than men. In overall wealth, too, black
women lag significantly behind. How can you have security when you
don\'t have income and savings? \[Most read\] Eric Trump not pressing
charges against waitress who spit on him at Chicago's Aviary, Trump
Organization says » These are the politics of a black woman\'s identity.
Already, Democratic candidates entering the presidential race have
acknowledged the importance of women, women of color, black women in
their pathways to victory. With this week\'s entry of Sen. Kamala Harris
of California, some candidates may be tempted to write off their chances
of capturing the votes of black women. That would be a mistake. These
voters are listening. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\'s
announcement framed her economic-populist message to appeal to women,
pointing to an economy that has failed women of color. Sen. Kirsten
Gillibrand of New York made a head-on pitch to women as a mom with a
record of fighting for gender equality. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
may soon join the field. But this work cannot be left to this fine array
of female candidates --- in 2020, this is men\'s work too. After Iowa
and New Hampshire, the road to success in the South goes through the
votes of black women. But remember: women/women of color/black women are
not a monolith --- they are individuals, and they want to be fought for.
Every candidate must wage that battle[. I don\'t pretend to know who
will win the Democratic nomination. But I do know that if he or she
ultimately makes it to the White House, it\'s going to be on the
strength and support of black women]{.underline}. The time to start
reaching out to them is now.

the rule from taking effect. "The fact that the murder rate has gone up
so much over the last several years should be an indicator that this is
not the time to focus on the profits for gun companies, rather than the
safety of the citizens of these countries," said Representative Norma
Torres of California, a native of Guatemala and the founder of the House
Central America Caucus]{.underline}**. **["Traveling to Mexico and the
Northern Triangle and talking to politicians there, this is the No. 1
topic they bring to our attention," she said, referring to Northern
Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The United
States is the largest supplier of guns globally, so it makes sense that
it would dominate the market in its own backyard]{.underline}**,
according to the analyst Nicholas Marsh, who tracked the U.N. data for
the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers, a nongovernmental
organization. Geographical proximity reduces shipping costs, making
exports to neighboring countries more profitable**[. But the U.S. gun
export business is also deeply tied to the country's role in regional
politics.]{.underline}** During the Cold War, the United States supplied
anti-communist insurgents, governments, and their associated
paramilitaries with guns, which they used to commit human rights abuses
and occasionally massacres**[. In the service of the ongoing war on
drugs, the United States has armed increasingly militarized police
forces across the hemisphere.]{.underline}** More recently, presidents
of both parties have armed anti-democratic and corrupt regimes: The
Obama administration approved increasing gun sales to Honduras after a
2009 coup, and the Trump administration publicly embraced the president
of Guatemala and sold him weapons despite his open opposition to United
Nations anti-corruption efforts.

#### Trump will continue to dismantle arms sales regulations to Latin America -- it is imperative that we block Trump

**[Under the current U.S. rules, which the Trump administration is now
on the verge of eliminating, a gun company seeking to sell weapons
abroad must apply for an export license and provide information on the
buyer.]{.underline}** State Department officials examine the application
for signs of trafficking, like unfamiliar or blacklisted customers. The
department's official guidance suggests taking into account how the arms
shipment might affect a range U.S. foreign-policy aims, including
counterterrorism. It also mandates consultation with embassies and law
enforcement. If the applicant wants to sell \$1 million or more worth of
guns (or \$14 million or more worth of larger military equipment), the
State Department must notify Congress. Elected officials can then delay
or cancel deals. Foreign service officers also perform "end-use" checks
to confirm that the person or entity receiving the weapons matches the
customer on the application. **[Critics in Congress and at think tanks
argue that the State Department export process still allows far too many
guns to be sold into areas where they might be used to harm civilians or
supply criminals, including the Northern Triangle. The enforcement
guidance does not specify which human rights abuses might be
disqualifying or how to weigh the likelihood of exports being used in an
atrocity, according to John Lindsay-Poland, an activist with Global
Exchange who is focused on U.S. arms trade policy in Mexico and Central
America .]{.underline}** The U.S. regulations for granting export
licenses merely say the State Department should "take into account"
risks like human rights abuses or trafficking. One State Department
veteran insisted the rules were more than just window dressing. "It
certainly wasn't the case that these transactions were being licensed
and approved willy-nilly," said **[Ed Peartree, who worked as the
department's director for defense trade controls policy from 2013 to
2017. Peartree said that under his watch, license applications were
routinely denied, the size of exports reduced, and extensive conditions
imposed on the end use of firearms]{.underline}**. **[For all the
legitimate concern about corruption, Peartree said he had seen few
documented instances in which U.S. arms legally exported to police or
military forces were used by Mexican or Central American criminal
organizations.]{.underline}**

#### Impact: US arms sales to Latin America are responsible for the militarization and mass increase of gun violence in Latin American countries.

**The Economist 5/23/2019 (Guns from the United States are flooding
Latin America,
https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/05/23/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america)**

Like a criminal and his fingerprints, every gun leaves its mark on the
ammunition it uses. Such traces are what Sergio Sandoval de la Peña
pores over daily in Mexico City's ballistics lab. A series of dark-green
circles, like the sub-woofer of a speaker, appear on his computer
screen. It is a digitised three-dimensional model of a cartridge, found
at the scene of a robbery this year and placed under a microscope.
Checking the marks against hundreds of thousands of potential matches,
Mr de la Peña concludes that the gun that ejected it was also used in a
murder last year. **[The ballistics technology employed to work such
wonders comes courtesy of the United States. Alas, so does the gun,
according to Mr de la Peña's database. A study of weapons found at crime
scenes suggests that 70% of gun crimes in Mexico involve American-bought
weapons. The share of homicides in Mexico involving a firearm grew from
16% in 1997 to 66% in 2017. That suggests around half of Mexico's 33,000
murder victims last year were killed by a gun manufactured in the United
States, which had 14,542 gun homicides in 2017. An American-made gun is
more likely to be used in a murder in Mexico than at
home.]{.underline}** Mexico is far from alone. Across Latin America, the
share of murders involving guns is creeping upwards. **[Many countries
already beset by organised crime and weak states have their troubles
compounded by their proximity to America, the country with the rich
world's most permissive gun laws. Changes signed by President Donald
Trump may only worsen the situation. Most guns enter Mexico after being
legally bought in the United States.]{.underline}** Criminal groups
typically use associates to buy them, smuggling guns in the opposite
direction to drugs. Beyond Mexico, American guns often arrive through
ports from Florida, hidden among other imported goods. In Honduras,
where half of all unregistered weapons come from America, smugglers have
been known to wrap guns in foil and submerge them in paint to avoid
detection from x-ray machines. Less creative, bigger groups simply pay
off customs officers. **[Does the availability of American guns boost
murder rates? The expiration in 2004 of an assault-weapons ban in the
United States provided a real-world experiment. A study found that in
Mexican municipalities bordering Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where
the guns were put back on sale, the murder rate shot up soon after.
Murder rates adjacent to California, which maintained a ban, stayed
flat.]{.underline}**

(solenne)

Change could come to Washington after the congressional mid-term
elections in November, and the bid of Gina Ortiz Jones to represent
Texas' 23rd congressional district certainly represents that
possibility. **[Jones, who recently emerged a victor in the Democratic
primary after a run-off in May, is a lesbian first-generation
Filipino-American who served as an intelligence officer in the Air Force
in Iraq under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."]{.underline}** Jones told the
Washington Blade her campaign is an effort "to protect the opportunities
that allowed me to grow up healthy, get an education and serve my
country." "My own story: I'm a first-generation American, I was raised
by a single mother, I know what it's like to need a little bit of help,"
Jones said. "Reduced lunch, subsidized housing --- I know why those are
important because I actually needed those investments, and those allowed
me to get an education**[." Jones also acknowledged her race has
significance for the LGBT community]{.underline}**. **[If elected, she'd
be the first openly gay person elected to Congress from Texas. "I'd be
honored to be the first, but it is more important that I am not the
last.]{.underline}** And that's what this race is about," Jones said.
"It's about protecting all the opportunities that allowed me even just
to get to this place, right? So, we are overdue in terms of
representation, and I think we're seeing every single day just how
quickly the progress that we fought for can be ripped away from us if we
don't stand up." Jones is among the women politicos set to speak Monday
at the **[annual LGBT gala in New York City hosted by the Democratic
National Committee, an event she said she's planning to attend because
"now is the time to ensure that your voice is heard." "That is a
gathering of people who know exactly about the moment of time that we're
in,"]{.underline}** Jones said. "**[[Many people in the room have fought
so hard for our rights, for our equality. And so, that makes me able to
share my own story and talk about what's going on in Texas and what I'm
looking to fight for, and certainly, on behalf of the LGBT community and
the opportunity that we have."]{.underline}]{.mark}** Lucas Acosta, LGBT
media director for the Democratic National Committee, said Jones is the
right candidate for the LGBT community facing continued hostility from
the Trump administration. "**[[In the face of sustained Republican
efforts to roll back the progress we've made, leaders within the LGBTQ
community, and LGBTQ women of color in particular, are stepping up,
running for office and fighting back]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Acosta
said. "**[Ortiz Jones will be a strong advocate not only for her
constituents, but also for the LGBTQ community and for all queer women
of color, who deserve a voice in Congress." Jones had stern words for
Trump, whose administration has worked to roll back LGBT rights despite
his promise during the election to be a friend to LGBT
people]{.underline}**. "He's anything but a friend. I mean, with friends
like that, who needs enemies?" **[The anti-LGBT rollbacks in the Trump
administration have included a transgender military ban the courts have
blocked the Pentagon from enforcing, executive actions for "religious
freedom" seen to undermine LGBT rights and exclusion of LGBT people from
the enforcement of federal civil rights laws]{.underline}**. "For this
administration to deny Americans ready and willing to serve our country,
willing to die for our country and this administration has made policies
essentially based on nothing but bigotry to deny those people the
opportunity to serve in our military," Jones said. With the Trump
administration's separation of migrant families seeking to enter the
United States as a result of its "zero-tolerance" immigration policy,
Jones --- who's running in a border district -- also criticized the
administration on that front. "I think it's a travesty, it's inhumane,
it's unjust and we have to get these families united as quickly as
possible," Jones said. **[Asked what the policy should be for migrant
families seeking to cross the border, Jones cited problems with changes
in how immigrants can seek and be considered for asylum]{.underline}**,
a backlog in judgment of those case and access of legal resources to
asylees. "That's very concerning that people who may have legitimate
cases are not even being able to make the case, right?" Jones said.
"That's not the kind of country we are. So we need much greater clarity
on why people are not able to make their case." Jones' opponent in her
race is Rep. Bill Hurd (R-Texas), who was the first black Republican
elected to Congress from Texas and worked for the Central Intelligence
Agency between 2000 and 2009. In the previous Congress, Hurd was a
co-sponsor of the First Amendment Defense Act, federal "religious
freedom" legislation seen to enable anti-LGBT discrimination. Last year,
Hurd also voted on the floor in favor of an amendment that would have
barred the U.S. military from paying for transition-related care,
including gender reassignment surgery, for transgender troops. Jones
criticized Hurd for voting for the anti-trans amendment, citing as it as
hypocrisy on the basis he claims to support national security "and then
takes votes like that that undermine military readiness." "As someone
that's served in the military and under 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' I know
that if one person on that team is not 100 percent, that unit is not 100
percent and the mission is at risk, so this is now an issue of military
readiness," Jones said. Jones also said Hurd is "certainly no friend to
the LGBT community" because he hasn't spoken out against rollbacks of
LGBT rights under the Trump administration. "**[In these times, when you
are silent as the most vulnerable in our community are targeted and
their rights are stripped from them, you are silent when those you need
you the most, that's just as telling,]{.underline}**" Jones said. If
elected to Congress, Jones identified reversal of Trump's transgender
military ban as a priority in her effort to advance LGBT rights as she
recalled her own time in the military having to serve under "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell." "When I think of national security, I don't just think of
Iraq and Afghanistan and China, Russia, I think about the pipeline of
talent in the interest of national security, and that certainly includes
members of the LGBT community who are, again, ready and willing to
serve," Jones said. **[Also on Jones' priority list is expanding federal
non-discrimination protections to include a prohibition on
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender
status.]{.underline}** "I think every single day that this
administration is intent on rolling back those protections, and they
want to leave it up to states to decide, but that's not how this
discussion needs to happen, right?" Jones said. "Americans deserve to
have equal access to health care, equal opportunity to serve their
country and equal opportunity to provide for themselves and their
families." **[[This Texas race isn't the only one of importance to LGBT
people.]{.mark} U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (R-Texas) is seeking to unseat
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has built a substantial anti-LGBT record
that includes introducing a constitutional amendment against the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision in favor of same-sex marriage
[nationwide]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On whether O'Rourke would prevail in
his race and defeat Cruz, Jones said she's hopeful her fellow Democrat
would prevail and defeat the anti-LGBT senator. Jones also had high
praise for **[Lupe Valdez, the lesbian former Dallas County sheriff
who's seeking to defeat Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in his bid for
re-election. Like Cruz, Abbott has an anti-LGBT record that includes
signing anti-LGBT "religious freedom" adoption legislation, urging the
Texas Supreme Court to undermine marriage equality and calling for a
special session of the legislature to pass anti-trans bathroom
legislation. "[For the LGBT community,]{.mark} I think that would
actually be more important,]{.underline}**" Jones said. "And so, again,
we're certainly hopeful we'll have change at that level as well. And so,
we can do this if we work together, and I think we have to, again. One
in ten kids in the country goes to school in Texas, so there's a lot at
stake and **[[we need representation that is going to fight for our
kids,]{.underline}]{.mark}** not against them." With the changing
demographics in Texas, political observers have predicted the state will
soon become "purple" and maybe even a "blue" Democratic state in years
to come. "**[[What we need to work on is]{.mark} actually [voter
turnout.]{.mark} Folks are registered]{.underline}**," Jones said. "So
it is, in fact, about turnout, so this is not a red state, it's a
non-voting state, and once we get people voting, this is, I think, a
safely blue state. But we just got to get people voting." --- Chris

##  Impacts

###  Climate Change

#### Trump is a climate change denier. Absent a new climate stance/new president, we will miss our window to resolve the climate crisis before it becomes irreversible.

**Heuvel 19,** (Katrina,BA in Politics from Princeton University, writes
a weekly column for The Post, She is the editor and publisher of the
Nation magazine and on the board of the Institute for Policy Studies,
5/21/19,Trump is Embracing Climate Destruction, The Washing Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/> ) ZH

Amid the daily infamies of Donald [Trump's presidency, his greatest
dereliction of duty is his decision not to confront but to accelerate
the greatest threat facing this country: the clear, present and growing
danger of catastrophic climate change. Trump is called a climate denier.
He is actually a warrior for climate calamity]{.underline}. In many
ways, Trump is the first president of the climate catastrophe era.
[We've already witnessed the undeniable first terrors: the fires that
[erased Paradise,
Calif.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46198498), in a day,
the storms that savaged Houston and Puerto Rico, floods in the Midwest,
droughts that forced millions to migrate from what used to be called the
Fertile Crescent.]{.underline} In the face of this and more, Trump has
chosen to go all in on the side of this direct security threat to our
people, our country and our world. Last week in Hackberry, La., [Trump
[celebrated his
collusion](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-energy-economic-development-lousiana-may-14-2019)
with the furies that threaten us, hailing the United States as the
"energy superpower of the world." Trump's speech consisted of his stale
stew of lies, exaggerations, boasts and insults, claiming credit for
transformations that began long before his presidency, and scorning
alternative views and opponents. Yet in the midst, he made it clear: He
is proud to contribute to the horrors that now threaten us.]{.underline}
The reality is no longer in dispute by anyone willing to be honest about
the science. We are on a path that has already begun to take casualties
and rack up staggering costs. A recent [U.N.
report](https://www.ipbes.net/news/ipbes-global-assessment-preview)
warns of the extinction of a million species --- [and the imperiling of
humanity
itself](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report)
--- in the next few decades. The conservative scientific consensus is
that we have about 12 years to transform how we produce energy to avoid
unimaginable [destruction. Continuing the current course will cost
trillions over the next decades ([more than the Green New
Deal](https://newrepublic.com/article/153702/green-new-deal-costs-less-nothing))
and, more importantly, displace hundreds of millions in forced
migrations, and spread disease, starvation and death at levels far
beyond any war yet witnessed.]{.underline} No wall Trump succeeds in
building would be able to deal with the [140 million climate
refugees](http://time.com/5206716/world-bank-climate-change-internal-migration/)
that the World Bank predicts by mid-century. In Louisiana, [[Trump
bragged](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-energy-economic-development-lousiana-may-14-2019)
that "American energy independence" would make our nation "wealthier"
and "safer.\" "We have an America First energy policy," he brayed. "We
don't need anybody.]{.underline} And we don't need to be ripped off by
the rest of the world, either, because those days are over." He boasted
about getting out of the Paris climate accord, "replacing the EPA,"
torpedoing President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, "unlocking" the
[Permian Basin](https://www.britannica.com/place/Permian-Basin) in Texas
and New Mexico, and more. And, of course, [Trump repeated his mockery of
the Green New Deal, [calling
it](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-energy-economic-development-lousiana-may-14-2019)
a "hoax]{.underline}, like the hoax I just went through.\" He continued,
"We will never let radical activists, special interests, and
out-of-control bureaucrats wreck our economy, eliminate our jobs, or
destroy your future." In fact, that is exactly what Trump is doing.
Lining up with the radical fossil-fuel activists and special interests,
installing energy lobbyists and lawyers into government, and empowering
them to make decisions that will --- if not reversed rapidly in the next
years --- "wreck our economy, eliminate our jobs, \[and\] destroy your
future," to say nothing of your children's lives and possibilities. The
stakes could not be higher. As Bill McKibben, the climate expert who
first warned of the climate change threat 30 years ago,
[noted](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/bill-mckibben-and-elizabeth-kolbert-is-it-too-late-to-save-the-world),
"[The problem with climate change is that it's a timed test. If you
don't solve it fast, then you don't solve it.]{.underline} No one's got
a plan for refreezing the Arctic once it's melted. \... We're not
playing for stopping climate change. We're playing --- maybe --- for
being able to slow it down to the point where it doesn't make
civilizations impossible." And we are facing an opposition led by a
president throwing in with powerful fossil-fuel interests and
corporations that have pumped millions into disinformation and
deception, and corrupted politics and politicians to preserve their
profits while posing a direct threat to our lives. The betrayal of Trump
and the Republican Party is self-evident. Sadly, [the leadership of the
Democratic Party has also been
AWOL](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18215571/nancy-pelosi-green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez),
as have too many voices in media, particularly television. House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.), former vice president Joe Biden and too many other Democrats
mistakenly seem to think that the best response to extremism is
moderation. Rather than seeking a mandate for the change we need
immediately, they choose to woo a mythic center with modest reforms.
Biden promises only to return to the Paris accord, a policy that might
have been promising in the late 1980s, but simply represents inadequate
moral signaling now. In the end, as McKibben writes, the fossil fuel
interests and their collaborators like Trump will lose this battle.
Already insurance companies are refusing to guarantee against losses
that are coming to coastal properties and elsewhere. The only question
--- and it is fundamental --- is how long it takes for the climate
destroyers to lose and how much damage is done in the interim. This is
why Trump's collusion is his greatest dereliction of duty. [The change
we need will come --- as it usually does --- from independent citizen
movements calling our compromised and corrupted leaders to
account.]{.underline} It's the [Extinction
Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/) that brought traffic to a crawl in
[London](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/24/extinction-rebellion-declares-end-to-london-protests)
last month. It's millions of children [walking out of
school](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/sunrise-movement-green-new-deal-2020-828766/).
It's the young activists of the Sunrise Movement vowing to force
Democratic presidential contenders to take a position on the Green New
Deal --- and demanding that this debate be at the center of the next
presidential election. These efforts would be amplified if the media
stepped up with heightened urgency to report on the climate crisis and
on the growing movements to address it. Toward that end, the Nation
magazine, which I edit, and the Columbia Journalism Review are launching
a [new
project](https://www.thenation.com/article/climate-change-media-aoc-gnd-propaganda/)
--- Covering Climate Now --- to bring journalists together to try to
find ways to dramatically improve media coverage of the climate crisis
and its solutions. [Fifty years from now, McKibben says, we are going to
run the world on sun and wind. The only question is whether the world
will be completely broken, or whether we will have acted in time to
avoid the worst. Trump has committed his administration to buttress the
immensely rich and powerful fossil-fuel interests in accelerating the
worst. Now we will see who has the courage and the conviction to stop
them.]{.underline}

###  Criminal Reform

#### Trump and the Republicans are terrible for criminal justice reform -- they're only willing to pass laws that help fund the private prison industry through surveillance and policing that incarcerate more black people. 

**Keith Wattley 12/4/18 (Keith Wattley, Founder and Executive Director,
received his B.A. in Psychology from Indiana University and his J.D.
from Santa Clara University School of Law. He has been advocating for
the rights of people in prison and parolees for nearly twenty years.
Prior to launching UnCommon Law in 2006, Keith was a staff attorney at
the Prison Law Office, a nonprofit law firm in Berkeley. He has
represented thousands of people in prison in impact litigation and
individual matters involving mental health care, gang validation,
religious freedom, prison infirmaries, medical care, excessive force,
visitation, parole consideration and parole revocation. He has also
trained hundreds of lawyers, law students and others in prisoner and
parole advocacy. "Trump's Criminal Justice Reform Is a Step in the Wrong
Direction".
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/opinion/trump-criminal-justice-reform.html)**

**[Donald Trump claims he's taking a step toward desperately needed
criminal justice reform, but he's not. A bipartisan bill known as the
First Step Act has been described by activists as
[groundbreaking](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/prison-sentencing-criminal-justice-reform.html?module=inline)in
the fight to end mass incarceration, and Mr. Trump has said he's
"[waiting with his
pen](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/trump-backed-criminal-justice-reform-bill-faces-uphill-battle-in-congress.html)"
for the bill to land on his desk. Some support the bill because it will
reduce some sentences and lead to some savings when it comes to the cost
of incarceration. Having spent many years working with people in prison
who are seeking release, I respectfully disagree.]{.underline}** This is
not a case in which a little reform is better than none. The bill
provides incentives for some people in federal prison to participate in
educational, vocational and therapeutic programs by awarding them
time-reducing credits for completing them. **[It also increases the use
of home detention, post-release transitional programs and electronic
monitoring. But it prevents those convicted of the most serious crimes
from reducing their sentences at all, and in doing so it perpetuates the
false narrative that people who commit violent crimes are fundamentally
different from those who commit nonviolent crimes.]{.underline}**
**[Ironically, it prevents those convicted of the most serious crimes
from reducing their sentences by participating in the programs this bill
cites as essential to smart criminal justice reform. I know from my
experience as the executive director of UnCommon Law, a nonprofit law
firm, that this is counterproductive in the fight for meaningful
criminal justice reform. We spend months and even years working with
people in prison for violent crimes, helping them to develop the
emotional intelligence and communication skills they'll need upon
release from prison. More than 200 of our clients have been released
from life sentences, and not a single one has gone on to commit a
violent crime. But this bill tells my clients their personal
transformation doesn't matter. In my experience, violence has its roots
in feelings of inadequacy and rejection dating back to childhood trauma.
And most people who commit violence also have the capacity to
reinterpret and overcome their traumatic experiences in a way that
brings understanding to, and remorse for, their own actions, along with
a newfound commitment to helping others learn from their
experience.]{.underline}** **[They are not fundamentally different from
people who have committed nonviolent offenses.]{.underline}** They and
the communities to which they return would most likely benefit the most
from incentives to participate in educational and therapeutic
programming, as well as earlier release. While it is tempting to believe
that we keep our communities safe by locking up people convicted of
violent crimes as long as possible and denying them time-reducing
credit, the reality is that the people our society fears the most ---
people convicted of murder and who have been paroled on a life sentence
--- are actually the least likely to return to prison even for a minor
infraction. Their return rate is [[roughly 1
percent]{.underline}](https://law.stanford.edu/publications/life-in-limbo-an-examination-of-parole-release-for-prisoners-serving-life-sentences-with-the-possibility-of-parole-in-california/).
**[We should not accept their categorical exclusion from
sentence-reducing measures that would permit their earlier return to the
community, where they can be the next generation of violence
interrupters. There are other misleading promises in this bill. For
example, it will reduce mandatory minimum sentences for perhaps [2,000
people
annually](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/16/what-s-really-in-the-first-step-act);
however, this part is not retroactive, so no one currently serving such
a sentence will have it shortened.]{.underline}** It also reduces the
discrepancy in sentencing for crack versus powder cocaine, which
Congress already did back in 2010. This bill just finally makes the
change retroactive, which may benefit up to [[2,600
people]{.underline}](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/prison-and-sentencing-impact-assessments/August_2018_Impact_Analysis_for_CBO.pdf).
After decades of "get tough" rhetoric, drug wars and a prison-building
boom that gave us the highest rate of incarceration in the world, it now
appears that reform is possible --- if only because we're finally
talking about it. But we must learn from our past, not replicate old
mistakes in present-day reforms. **[This bill is likely to benefit
private prison companies more than the incarcerated population, as it
seems primed to increase the use of electronic monitoring systems
created by private corporations to to track, surveil and control those
who have been released from prison and are in home-detention and
post-release transitional programs. Indeed, one of those corporations,
GEO Group, proudly bills itself as "a [complete electronic monitoring
solutions provider](https://www.geogroup.com/Electronic_Monitoring)" and
already has 30,000 "participants" in its programs. The total number of
people benefited by the bill is shockingly small --- it affects only
[about
4,000](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/16/what-s-really-in-the-first-step-act)
in the federal prison system, which itself makes up less than 10 percent
of the total population of [people incarcerated in the United
States.](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2018.html) A large
majority of incarcerated people are actually housed in state prisons and
local jails, which are unaffected by this bill. Although some have
celebrated the bill because it prohibits the shackling of women during
childbirth, the practice of shackling pregnant women in all but the most
extreme circumstances has been [banned in federal
prisons](https://www.aclu.org/blog/bureau-prisons-revises-policy-shackling-pregnant-inmates)
for 10 years, so the provision will likely have little to no practical
effect.]{.underline}** I stand with advocates seeking to bring people
home from prison sooner rather than later. It's what I do. **[But we
should not be tempted by the false promise that this is the beginning of
a more expansive reform effort. Those in control have not taken any
steps toward real criminal justice reform, which ideally would involve
developing real alternatives to incarceration. When policymakers want to
have that conversation, please count me in. But any would-be reform
effort that begins by denying the benefits of therapeutic, educational
and vocational programs to the people who could benefit most is not a
"first step" --- it's a step in the wrong direction.]{.underline}**

#### Democrats are key to reforming the criminal justice system, reducing the racial wealth gap, instituting a single payer health system and making college free all political reforms that would have drastic material benefits for black people

**Breuninger 4/5/19** (Kevin is a Breaking News and Politics reporter at
CNBC who attended the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. "Reparations,
criminal justice reform and Trump: Democratic presidential candidates
make progressive pledges at Al Sharpton-led convention".
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/2020-democrats-pledge-support-for-reparations-at-al-sharpton-led-convention.html)

**[A slew of democratic candidates hoping to challenge President Donald
Trump for the White House spelled out their views on racial justice
Friday in progressive campaign pitches to crowds at Al Sharpton's
National Action Network convention. Nearly all of the 15-plus Democrats
who have launched campaigns in the 2020 election showed up to the civil
rights organization's annual conference this week in a Sheraton hotel
ballroom in Manhattan's Times Square. Eight of those candidates gave
speeches on Friday -- including Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who had just
announced his campaign a day earlier -- touching on a range of issues
including taxes, child care and climate change. But the predominant
themes of their remarks mirrored the NAN's own stated priorities,
particularly reforming the criminal justice system with the past and
current impacts of racism in America at top of mind. And most of the
2020 contenders, often prompted by Sharpton himself, also affirmed their
support for a bill introduced in Congress that would create a commission
to study reparations for African-Americans. "When I am elected
president, I will sign that bill," Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told
Sharpton to raucous applause from the convention hall crowd. Harris also
pledged to double the size of the civil rights division of the Justice
Department: "Justice means recognizing domestic terrorism, including
white nationalist extremism," which Harris said "should be considered a
national security priority." Bernie Sanders, the Independent senator
from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist who is running as a
Democrat in 2020, called to repair the "racial wealth gap," establish a
single-payer health care system for all Americans, make public colleges
and universities tuition-free and force large corporations to "start
paying their fair share."]{.underline}**

#### [Progressive Democrats are the only option to enact criminal justice reform.]{.underline} 

**Perry Bacon Jr. 6/20/19 (Perry Bacon Jr. is a senior writer for
FiveThirtyEight. "Democratic Candidates Answer Yes-Or-No Questions About
Criminal Justice Policy".
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-candidates-are-the-most-progressive-on-criminal-justice-issues/)**

**[The field is way to the left of where the Democratic Party used to be
on criminal justice issues. We got responses from 16 candidates.
Thirteen of the 16 answered "yes" to at least four of the questions,
indicating fairly liberal stands on criminal justice issues. In fact, 11
of the 16 support a criminal justice platform that I think would have
been inconceivable even a decade ago for a presidential candidate who
was actually trying to win (as opposed to running a more symbolic
campaign). Those 11 all support abolishing the death penalty at the
state and federal levels, legalizing marijuana at the state and federal
levels, allowing people who are incarcerated to receive Pell Grants so
that they can enroll in higher-education courses, and eliminating cash
bail at all levels of government.]{.underline}** Two other candidates
embraced at least four of the six ideas but with a slightly different
mix. Tim Ryan doesn't fully support getting rid of the death penalty;
his campaign said he thinks there should be an exception for terrorists.
But he favors an idea that some of the other candidates were hesitant to
embrace: removing the Office of the Pardon Attorney from the Justice
Department. (The Brennan Center argues that the department is run by
prosecutors who may have an incentive to preserve conviction rates,
creating potential conflicts of interest when it comes to issuing
pardons. The center favors creating an independent board or commission
that is outside the purview of the department to advise the president on
pardons and commutations.) Inslee, meanwhile, also supports limiting the
Justice Department's role in pardons and commutations, but his aides did
not give a clear "yes" or "no" to our question about cash bail. **[It's
important to note that the candidates aligned with the Democrats' most
liberal wings (Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, for example) are not
the only ones taking these stances. Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke,
Buttigieg and Ryan, who are all arguably more associated with the
center-left of the party, were among the 13 taking clearly progressive
stands on these issues.]{.underline}**

###  Economic Disparity 

#### [Only Democrats will pass reforms to lessen the racially-based economic inequality that has spiked under the Trump presidency.]{.underline}

ideas to confront inequality."
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/racial-wealth-gap-vast-2020-democrats-have-plans-close-it-n1007051)**

**[If you've been to an event with a Democrat running for president this
year, there\'s a good chance you've heard about it: the racial wealth
gap. Candidates are regularly bringing up the fact that the typical
black family has only one-tenth the assets of the typical white family
--- a divide that has grown larger than it was 35 years ago. Far from a
niche concern, candidates have incorporated it into their signature
proposals. They\'ve addressed it in speeches not just to black churches
in South Carolina, but also to mostly white town hall crowds in Iowa and
New Hampshire. In many ways, it\'s a defining issue of the 2020 cycle so
far, one that brings together multiple trends that are transforming the
party: the rising clout of nonwhite voters, a rush to embrace more
ambitious policy, and heightened concerns about both racism and
inequality under President Donald Trump. In Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren
of Massachusetts gives detailed history lessons on how discriminatory
policies created the wealth gap while predatory lending and mass
incarceration exacerbated it. Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas
congressman, condemns the "imperfect, unfair, unjust and racist
capitalist economy.\" Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey doesn't just bring
up the disparity in places like New Hampshire, he brings state-specific
data along with him. "We've got to find ways to balance the economic
scales and have true equality of opportunity in our country," Booker
told NBC News in an interview. "If we aren\'t willing to talk about the
problem, then it's very hard to think that we'll come up with real
solutions to that problem." Politicians, academics and activists who've
worked on these issues say this cycle is unique both in the emphasis.
White House hopefuls have put on the racial wealth gap, but also the
type of detailed agendas they\'ve proposed to address it. \"I think
black voters are waking up to the fact that in exchange for our votes,
we are demanding accountability for the issues that really matter for
our community,\" said Akunna Cook, executive director of the Black
Economic Alliance, which is hosting a forum with 2020 candidates next
month in South Carolina.]{.underline}**

Committee is the formal governing body for the United States Democratic
Party. The committee coordinates strategy to support Democratic Party
candidates throughout the country for local, state, and national office.
https://democrats.org/issues/immigration-reform/)**

**[Democrats are fighting for every immigrant who feels threatened by
Donald Trump's election. We will not stand by and watch families be torn
apart --- Democrats in Congress and in states and cities across the
country are already standing up to Trump's hatred and bigotry to defend
their immigrant neighbors. Thanks to President Obama, hundreds of
thousands of DREAMers have been able to receive a temporary status that
allows them to study, work, pay taxes, and contribute to the communities
they grew up in. His administration has made a tremendous difference by
prioritizing immigration enforcement so that it is focused on those with
criminal records and doesn't arbitrarily separate families, and
Democrats are fighting to protect that progress. Democrats will continue
to work toward comprehensive immigration reform that fixes our nation's
broken immigration system, improves border security, prioritizes
enforcement so we are targeting criminals -- not families, keeps
families together, and strengthens our economy. Democrats know the
importance of our country's history as a nation of immigrants. We honor
our fundamental values by treating all people who come to the United
States with dignity and respect, and we always seek to embrace --- not
to to attack --- immigrants.]{.underline}**

#### [If Trump is reelected, he will continue to pass xenophobic immigration policies that put immigrants in extreme danger.]{.underline}

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 17, 2019 "All people that are
illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our
Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the
laws are changed," Trump said Friday on Twitter. "Please do not make
yourselves too comfortable, you will be leaving soon!" Trump comments
followed his call yesterday for implementing a new, points-based merit
system for allocating green cards. His immigration proposal also urges
new funding for border security measures, including construction of the
his signature border wall. The plan was already showing signs it was
headed for defeat, with some of Trump's fellow Republicans throwing cold
water on it even before it was officially unveiled. Trump has repeatedly
disparaged Mexican and Central American immigrants, starting with his
2016 campaign launch in which he accused Mexico of sending criminals and
rapists to the U.S. "We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to
get them out," Trump said in October 2016 during his final debate
against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.]{.underline}**

**[Much of the [militarized weaponry]{.mark} seen in Ferguson [comes
directly from the Pentagon through the 1033 weapons transfer
program]{.mark}]{.underline}** begun in 1997. This program has resulted
in the distribution of \$4 billion worth of equipment. **[[Local police

1033,]{.underline}** the Department of Homeland Security **[(DHS) has
also given out \$34 billion]{.underline}** in "terrorism grants" that
have been a tremendous boon for military contractors trying to expand
their reach into civilian policing markets. In response to the events in
Ferguson, **[[US Representative]{.mark} Hank Johnson from Georgia has
[sent a letter to members of Congress expressing his intent to introduce
a bill ending the 1033 program]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The passage of
this bill, as well as the ending of DHS terror grants, needs to be
combined with federal restrictions on the use of military equipment in
order to prevent **[the kind of militarized response seen in
Ferguson]{.underline}**. One of the uses of this new hardware **[has
been specifically in the suppression of dissent]{.underline}**. While
many big-city departments have resisted this trend, many others, along
with hundreds of medium-sized and smaller cities, have invested millions
in [body armor, riot shields and less lethal
weaponry](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/opinion/sunday/riot-gears-evolution.html?_r=2&)
. Some of this technology was on display in several cities during the
Occupy movement. An article by Radley Balko, author of **[The Rise of
the Warrior Cop]{.underline}** , in last week's [*Washington
Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/08/14/after-ferguson-how-should-police-respond-to-protests/)
lays out the danger of such strategies. Departments need to return to
less intensive protest policing, which is cheaper, more effective in
maintaining order, and better for overall police-community relations.
**[P[olice need to rely on better communication, flexibility and
tolerance rather than ever-more-intensive [command-and-control

. Federal courts need to expand First Amendment protections to enhance
not just the right of speech but also the right of assembly, [which has
been greatly abridged in recent
decades](http://www.uclalawreview.org/?p=195). **[Since 9/11 there has
been a tremendous expansion of the surveillance and
intelligence-gathering functions of local police in conjunction with
federal authorities]{.underline}**. The Department of Homeland Security
has funded the creation of dozens of anti-terror fusion centers across
the country. Since the actual threat of terrorism in places like Helena,
Montana, and Jefferson, Missouri, is so minuscule, they engage instead
in broad surveillance activities, partnering in some cases with local
businesses to do political threat assessments targeting [peace
activists](http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/10/18/fusion-center-boston-police-spied-on-peace-activists/),
[the Occupy
movement](http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/23/expensive-fusion-centers-tracked-occupy)
and many others. In October 2012 **[the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations issued]{.underline}** a
[report](http://publicintelligence.net/hsgac-fusion-centers/) showing
that these centers had not generated **[any information relevant to
terrorism and criticized DHS for resisting any effort at
oversight.]{.underline}** Congress should end this program and enact
restrictions on the gathering and sharing of intelligence independent of
specific criminal activities. Some of this unrestricted surveillance is
carried out by new police drones. Departments across the country are
using or exploring this technology with little or no oversight. **[The
possibility of massive invasions of privacy, violations of the Fourth
Amendment and even the death or injury of members of the public from
armed drones raises major concerns.]{.underline}** Federal regulations
are needed to restrict the use of this new technology to ensure that
their use is narrowly tailored to legitimate law-enforcement purposes,
and that constitutional standards are met regarding privacy,
intelligence-gathering and use of force. Special Weapons And Tactics
**[(SWAT) teams have become the primary consumers of militarized
weaponry and tactics.]{.underline}** Federal incentives and "mission
creep" quickly shifted the role of these teams, originally created
during the panics about political violence in the 1960s and '70s, to
drug enforcement. Peter Kraska, author of **[Militarizing the American
Criminal Justice System]{.underline}** ,
[shows](http://www.ndsn.org/july97/swat.html) that [the number of
SWAT]{.mark} [teams exploded]{.mark} over the last thirty years, [and
their role]{.mark} has e[xpanded]{.mark} too. **[[Heavily armed teams
are almost never used for their original purpose of dealing with hostage
situations or barricaded suspects]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Instead, their
function is now to serve warrants, back up low-level buy-and-bust drug
operations and patrol high-crime areas. Much of this expansion was
driven by federal policies that funded the equipment for such teams
either directly or through asset forfeiture laws. The increased use of
paramilitary units has resulted in dozens of incidents in which police
have wrongfully killed or injured people. The most horrendous of late
was the [throwing of a flashbang grenade into the crib of an
infant](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/baby-in-coma-after-police-grenade-dropped-in-crib-during-drug-raid/)
during a Georgia drug raid in May. The toddler was severely burned and
entered a coma. **[No drugs were found and no arrests made. So far none
of the officers have been charged with any crime or formally
disciplined. In fact, the local prosecutor threatened to charge family
members for the child's injuries. This near total lack of accountability
for botched raids, excessive use of force and the dehumanization of
suspects must be corrected.]{.underline}** Local DAs cannot be counted
on to hold police accountable because of their close daily cooperation
with the police. **[[Independent offices of police prosecution]{.mark}
("[blue

Department of [Justice needs to be]{.mark} more [aggressive]{.mark} in
intervening [in cases]{.mark} [where no local action is]{.mark}
taken.]{.underline}** The expansion in the number of paramilitary police
units has been accompanied by an increase in military-style training.
Former military personnel have launched a massive market to train normal
patrol units in paramilitary combat. Patrol units are often introduced
to such training as a way of fostering team identification and
military-style camaraderie**[. [These trainings fly in the face of the
fundamentally civilian nature of policing.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In the
UK, the police (who mostly do not carry firearms), rely heavily on the
concept of policing by consent, which emerged from the earliest thinking
about civilian police in the early nineteenth century. Any policing that
loses the support of those policed will not be effective and will lead
to an escalation of conflict and the use of force, creating a vicious
cycle. This is exactly the cycle we are in now as ever-more-aggressive
policing has undermined public support for the police, especially in
communities of color, and engendered more resistance and escalation, as
seen in the case of [Eric
Garner](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/paying-blood-over-policing-article-1.1872536),
who was killed by police in New York City earlier this summer.
Ultimately, **[[what underlies most of these militarized forms of
policing is a cynical politics of race that has perverted criminal
justice policies; they are no longer about crime or
justice]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but instead the management of poor and
non-white populations through ever-more-punitive practices. Michelle
Alexander, in **[The New Jim Crow]{.underline}**, describes how modern
criminal justice policy was driven by a Republican effort to appeal to
white voters in the South and then by Democrats hoping to inoculate
themselves against charges (i.e., the notorious Willie Horton smear) of
being soft on crime. One of the most pernicious expressions of this has
been the War on Drugs, which opened the floodgates for a massive
intensification of policing in the United States. In many parts of the
country, low-level drug arrests remain the primary means by which young
people of color end up in the criminal justice system. **[To reverse
this trend, we must move to end the War on Drugs by legalizing and
regulating not just marijuana but all drugs. Portugal's
decriminalization of drugs [has both reduced crime and the public health
harms](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html)
associated with drugs]{.underline}**. Drug use should be understood as a
public health matter and taken out of the realm of policing. Christian
Parenti reminds us in **[Lockdown America]{.underline}** and **[The Soft
Cage]{.underline}** that the history of the police in the United States
is a history of racism, and the militarization of policing is one
expression of that history. While [individual officers]{.mark} and
police executives [may be motivated by the best]{.mark} of
[intentions,]{.mark} [as long as they continue to be the primary tool
for managing]{.mark} social discord, poverty and even [crime, we will
see a continuation of the over-policing of communities of color]{.mark}.
**[It is this dynamic that is the most difficult to address, and the
most important. [We must invest in social policies that end the
criminalization of poverty]{.mark} and attempt instead to deal with
problems like drug abuse, homelessness, mental illness and even violent
crime as public health and economic justice issues]{.underline}**. We
need to reinvigorate our mental health systems and rely more on
[civilian crisis response
teams](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/06/02/in_crisis_can_mobile_crisis_intervention_teams_end_police_killings.html).
In many communities homelessness has become a major source of social
disorder; the solutions are real investments in affordable housing, wage
supports and social services, not "quality of life" policing. **[Across
the country[, [community-based organizations](http://cureviolence.org/),
sometimes working with [local health
departments](http://www.minneapolismn.gov/health/youth/yvp/), are
addressing youth violence through peer mediation, gang truces and youth
development rather than gang databases and mass
criminalization]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While we may always need some
state body to exercise force in the interests of the common good, that
use of force should be limited, proportional, and always the last
resort, not the first.

has become the target of those who desire reforms to reduce the number
of civilian deaths. However, most of the scholarship on militarization
is limited, either focusing on [certain specific

that result from militarization, on the existence of police [Special

In [new
research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209),
[[I argue that **militarization is a psychological process**]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [affects]{.mark} individual o[fficers as well as
departments.]{.mark} This process involves the adoption of a more
militaristic world view, where [militarism is the emphasis on the use of
force as an acceptable]{.mark}---[or even desirable]{.mark}---[option to
address problems]{.mark}. Militarization may affect the behavior of
individual officers in one, or both, or two ways. [Militarized police
departments **see themselves**]{.mark} not as public servants upholding
the law]{.underline}, [but **[as an army fighting a war against a
dangerous and invisible enemy and occupying]{.mark}**]{.underline}
territory [that is]{.underline} hostile [to them.]{.underline} To carry
out these actions, the leaders of those departments desire military
equipment---vehicles, weapons, body armor, and so forth---because it
provides better protection from the enemy and promotes both more
efficient use of force and more fear among the public. And, [**[when
departments are more militarized]{.mark}, [their officers should kill
more people]{.mark}**. My statistical analysis supports this argument,
controlling for other possible drivers of police killings such as the
racial composition of the area, the total population, the level of
poverty, and the rate of violent crime]{.underline}, using
cross-national data that includes law enforcement agencies from over 40
states quarterly from the last quarter of 2014 to the last quarter of
2016. I find that, as a police department's militarization increases, so
does the number of civilians killed. Figure 1 displays the expected
number of police killings at varying levels of militarization, [which I
measure using police department acquisitions through the federal '1033'
program. This is a program that allows law enforcement agencies to
obtain surplus military equipment from the federal government, paying
only the cost of transport.]{.underline} Think of it as a backwards

**[Militarizing police forces does not reduce crime or make police
officers safer]{.underline}**, according to a study published recently
in the *Proceedings of the National Academy* *of Sciences.* **["On
average, militarized police units do not appear to provide the safety
beneﬁts that many police administrators claim," said Jonathan Mummolo,
Assistant Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton
Universit]{.underline}**y, the study's author. The results of Mummolo's
research may not seem surprising, but they directly contradict the
assertions of law enforcement officials across the country, from the
local to the federal level. After police responded to the 2014 protests
in Ferguson, Missouri with assault rifles and tanks, Col. John Belmar,
the top police officer in the county, claimed that military equipment
had kept civilians and officers safe during the protests. "**[Had we not
had the ability to protect officers with those vehicles, I am afraid
that we would have \[had\] to engage people with our own gunfire,"
Belmar told USA Today. "I really think having the armor gave us the
ability not to have pulled one trigger]{.underline}**." If the armor was
necessary to prevent the police from firing, one wonders why they
carried assault rifles in the first place. At a 2016 press conference,
Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that **[N]{.underline}**ew
**[Y]{.underline}**ork **[C]{.underline}**ity **[would be providing
\$7.5 million worth of military helmets and vests to its police
force]{.underline}**. "An attack on our police officers is an attack on
all of us," he said. **["And we have to make sure we're taking every
measure available to protect our officers with the latest gear, the
latest technology, given the horrible scourge of guns in this country,
and how we've seen these guns turned against law
enforcement]{.underline}**." **[[Militarization of the police]{.mark}
started in the 1990s [under]{.mark} the Department of Defense's Program
[1033,]{.mark} which [provides surplus military gear to federal,
state]{.mark}, and local police under the guise of the War on
Drugs]{.underline}**. Examples of this war-making equipment included
grenade launchers, armored vehicles and bayonets. These armaments flowed
steadily to the police over the decades, with more than \$5 billion in
surplus gear transferred to date. People around the world were shocked
and outraged at the brutal response to the protests in Ferguson, and by
the way that the police force had been transformed into an occupying
army. As part of an effort to ease popular anger, the Obama
administration slightly restricted, but did not eliminate, police
departments' ability to obtain surplus military gear. "Those
restrictions went too far," said Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he
addressed the 63rd Biennial Conference of the National Fraternal Order
of Police last August. "We will not put superficial concerns above
public safety." Any reservations about turning police into soldiers who
fight battles against citizens were thus "superficial," in the eyes of
the Trump administration. Sessions described the weapons as "life-saving
gear" that are needed to fight "terrorism" and "crime." Mummolo's
research shows that such talk is no more than a pretense. For his
research, **[he [defined]{.mark} police militarization [as]{.mark} "a
continuum deﬁned by [a combination of]{.mark} equipment, [tactics, and
culture that centers on]{.mark} violent [conﬂict." It is difficult to
categorize]{.mark} certain [localities as militarized]{.mark}
[because]{.mark} the degree of [militarization varies from place to
place]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mummolo overcame this difficulty by
focusing on special weapons and tactics (SWAT) teams, which are modeled
on military special forces units and represent "a heightened commitment
to the use of militarized equipment and tactics." Through a public
records request, Mummolo obtained information about every SWAT
deployment in Maryland over the five-year period from fiscal 2010
through fiscal 2014. Maryland agencies had recorded all SWAT activity
uniformly because of a state law, since expired, that had required them
to do so. There were approximately 8,200 SWAT deployments during the
period that Mummolo studied. To determine the extent to which police
militarization affects crime and ofﬁcer safety, Mummolo combined data
from the federal Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies
surveys (which describe whether agencies provide SWAT services) with FBI
data on violent crimes and the FBI's Law Enforcement Ofﬁcers Killed and
Assaulted database. Mummolo found that, far from fighting violent crime
or terrorism, the purpose of approximately 91 percent of SWAT
deployments was to serve search warrants. Deploying a SWAT team for this
purpose is to apply excessive and overwhelming force. The operation
"often **[involves]{.underline}** percussive **[grenades, battering
rams, substantial property damage, and,]{.underline}** in rare cases**[,
deadly [altercations stemming from citizens']{.mark}]{.underline}**
[mistaken **[belief that they are experiencing a home
invasion,"]{.underline}** ]{.mark}said Mummolo. Less than 5 percent of
deployments were responses to "barricade" scenarios, which involve an
armed suspect who refuses to surrender to police. The data "show that
the vast majority of SWAT deployments occur in connection with
nonemergency scenarios," said Mummolo. **[The soldiers-policemen enter
homes forcibly in 68 percent of deployments]{.underline}** **[and seize
property in 84 percent of deployments]{.underline}**. This shameless
**[brutality can have no purpose other than terrorizing the working
class.]{.underline}** The demographic makeup of Maryland's localities
varies in racial diversity. Mummolo found that the higher the percentage
of black residents in an area, the greater the volume of SWAT
deployments per 100,000 residents in that area. **[This correlation
persisted]{.underline}** after Mummolo controlled for local
unemployment, education, household income levels and local crime rates.
The data confirm that SWAT teams are used to attack the poorest layers
of the population. When he examined the data to evaluate the effect of a
department's use of a SWAT team on violent crime, Mummolo concluded that
"**[[there is no evidence that acquiring a SWAT team lowers
crime]{.mark} or promotes ofﬁcer safety.... [Using the available data,
the beneﬁts of increased deployments \[on crime and officer safety\]
appear to be either small or
nonexistent]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}" These findings expose the
claims of Belmar and Sessions as fraudulent. The study uses its results
to also suggest that if only greater care is taken by the authorities in
the deployment of military gear, police-community relations will
benefit. "...\[P\]olice may suffer reputational damage when they deploy
militarized units," said Mummolo. **["These results suggest that the
often-cited trade-off between public safety and civil liberties is, in
the case of militarized policing, a false choice." In other words, the
aim is to convince the authorities to proceed with more caution as they
continue their campaign to defend]{.underline}** the status quo of
**[record inequality and exploitation]{.underline}**. To examine how
exposure to images of militarized police affects the public's attitude
toward law enforcement, Mummolo conducted two surveys. He concluded that
**[[viewing photos of militarized police decreased respondents' support
for police funding]{.underline}]{.mark}** and decreased "confidence" in
the police. One illuminating result is that Mummolo found little
evidence that race influenced people's response to images of militarized
police, despite lower baseline levels of confidence in the police among
African-Americans. This result suggests that **[workers regardless of
their race correctly identify the police as their
antagonists]{.underline}**. The reputational costs of militarization to
law enforcement are "troubling," said Mummolo, "since prior work shows
that negative views of police inhibit criminal investigations and are
associated with stunted civic participation." Contrary to what the
report suggests, however, the police are not interested in greater
"civic participation" in working class communities**[. Riot gear,
percussion grenades, and assault rifles are not intended to encourage
civic engagement, but to suppress it]{.underline}**. Police terror is a
means of silencing the working class and sending the message that any
resistance to deteriorating working and living conditions will entail a
heavy cost. The repeal of the very mild Obama-era restrictions on police
acquisition of military equipment comes as the struggles waged by
teachers, UPS employees, and other workers across the country are
intensifying**[. [The fight for a living wage, for adequate health care,
and for a more human existence is the real "terror" that militarized
police are intended to combat]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

###  Roe v Wade

#### [Democrats are key to protecting Roe vs. Wade and all reproductive rights.]{.underline} 

**Emma Green 6/3/2019 (Emma Green is a staff writer at *The Atlantic,*
where she covers politics, policy, and religion. "2020 Candidates Are
Going All In on Abortion Rights"
https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-green/)**

**[In general, Democrats have been eager to prove their support for
abortion rights. As Gillibrand has unveiled new policy proposals,
they've quickly been adopted or adapted by a number of her competitors
in the 2020 field. "It's the tenacity and passion and dedication to this
issue over a decade that sets me apart from many Democrats," she told
me. "I'm very proud to have led the 2020 conversation." She wants to
repeal the Hyde Amendment, and she promises to impose a litmus test on
potential Supreme Court justices and nominate only judges who will
uphold "Roe v. Wade as settled law and protect women's reproductive
rights," according to her website. Gillibrand has also vowed to pass
federal legislation that would protect private insurance coverage for
abortion, create funding for "reproductive health \[centers\]," and
"supersede ... harmful state restrictions" on abortion services or
providers. This plan to override state abortion restrictions is popular
among Democratic candidates: Just this week, Harris argued that the
Justice Department should have to approve all state laws having to do
with abortion, similar to the way voting-related laws in some states
were reviewed following the battle over civil rights in the 1960s. Some
of Gillibrand's proposals make for better talking points than coherent
policies. For example, the former defense attorney and government lawyer
has vowed to "codify Roe v. Wade into law." It's impossible to literally
codify Roe without passing a constitutional amendment, since the Supreme
Court decision asserted a constitutional principle; besides, the
framework for most court decisions about abortion today relies on
jurisprudence that came after Roe. When I asked Gillibrand what would
actually be in her proposed law, she said, "Just the status of the law
today, that this is reproductive freedom that the laws and courts have
guaranteed for over a generation, and that we want that guarantee to be
in statute." Other candidates, including Booker and Warren, have joined
Gillibrand's cry to codify Roe, although Warren has sidestepped the
legal murkiness with a proposal to establish "federal, statutory rights
that parallel the constitutional right in Roe v. Wade." Notably,
Gillibrand was unwilling to say she would expand abortion rights to
include abortion at any point in pregnancy---a position being pushed by
Democrats in blue states, including in her home state of New York. "I
think the status of the law today makes sense," she told me, answering
follow-up questions only with broad statements about expanding abortion
access to poor women and women of color. By contrast, her male peers in
the Democratic field have been willing to go that far: When asked during
a Fox News town hall about when abortion should be limited, South Bend,
Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said, "I trust women to draw the line."
Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas has answered this question
similarly. "I think those decisions are best left to a woman and her
doctor," he told a reporter earlier this spring. Andrew Yang, the
entrepreneur and founder of Venture for America, tweeted, "I personally
don't think male legislators should be weighing in on women's
reproductive rights and freedoms ... I'm happy to let women decide for
themselves." This is the only abortion issue on which Gillibrand is not
outflanking her competitors to the left.]{.underline}**

**[To see what Republicans really think about abortion, just look at the
two-track strategy of doing as much as possible to limit access to
abortion under existing law while teeing up vehicles to get Roe
overruled. Ohio is an example of a state that has pursued both
approaches. In addition to the "fetal heartbeat" bill that directly
challenges Roe, it has also targeted abortion clinics with onerous legal
restrictions, with the result that the number of abortion clinics in the
state has been reduced from 45 in 1992 to 10 today. In addition, the
idea that Roe being overturned will mean that evangelicals will no
longer have the issue to rally around is puzzling. If Roe is overruled,
the result would be conflicts over abortion laws in most states as well
as Congress. And preserving the movement's legislative victories would
still require maintaining control of the Supreme Court. The only hope
for Roe, then, lies with Chief Justice Roberts, now the Court's median
vote on the issue. Could Roberts, who disappointed conservatives by
casting the deciding vote to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act,
cross them again by saving Roe? This is highly unlikely. NFIB v.
Sebelius, the vote that saved Obamacare, was a rare exception in
Roberts's track record, and even in that case, he inflicted significant
damage on the statute's expansion of Medicaid. From eviscerating the
Voting Rights Act to gutting campaign finance law, Roberts has generally
sided with longstanding movement conservative priorities even when the
results are unpopular. On abortion, he voted with the minority in the
2016 case to uphold the Texas anti-abortion law, which, if left in
place, would in itself effectively render Roe a nullity by allowing
states to stop abortion clinics from operating. It is true that Roberts
has often tried to slowly dismantle precedents he dislikes rather than
overruling them immediately. The Court may well take the judicial
obfuscation route in dismantling Roe, starting with cases that give
states more leeway to restrict abortions instead of explicitly
announcing that it is overruling Roe immediately, giving conservative
policy victories without the political costs. The Court is likely to try
to put off consideration of the laws (like Georgia's and Alabama's) that
most directly threaten Roe until after the 2020 elections. But the
willingness to overturn decades-old precedent is there. Just this week,
the Court's conservative majority ruled, in Franchise Tax Board of
California v. Hyatt, to throw stare decisis out the window and overrule
a 1979 decision on whether a state could be sued in another state's
courts --- not because the decision had proven unworkable or any
relevant facts had changed but because a bare majority of the Court
would have ruled differently had they heard the case in the first
instance. The decision had nothing to do with abortion --- and
everything to do with it. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen
Breyer sent up a warning flare: "Today's decision can only cause one to
wonder which cases the court will overrule next." However the Court
describes what it's doing to Roe, in short order, states will have the
tools necessary to make abortion almost or entirely inaccessible for
tens of millions of Americans. Eventually, the Court will have to face
Roe head on, and it's overwhelmingly likely that it will overrule Roe if
Roberts is the median vote --- and a near certainty if a Republican
president can replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen
Breyer.]{.underline}**

**[After Texas enacted some parts of its law in 2013, the number of
facilities providing abortion care decreased by almost half.5 Research
shows that women now report multiple barriers to obtaining safe abortion
care, including increased travel time, longer waits for an appointment
and greater costs.6 Abortion restrictions put women's health, safety and
wellbeing at risk Delaying or effectively blocking abortion care puts
women's health at risk. When a woman has no option but to obtain an
abortion later in pregnancy, major complications are more likely and
costs are higher.1 Additionally, research shows that carrying an
unwanted pregnancy to term is more dangerous to a woman's health than
abortion.7 Research also shows that abortion does not negatively impact
a woman's well-being. Contrary to some claims, abortion does not place
women at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, low
self-esteem or anxiety, nor does it increase drug, tobacco or alcohol
use.8-13 Over 95% of women report that abortion was the right decision
for them.14 One year later, women who obtained abortion care were more
likely to have a positive outlook on life than women denied this care.15
Abortion restrictions may put a woman's physical and emotional safety at
risk. Limited abortion access may result in more women being unable to
terminate unwanted pregnancies, keeping them in contact with violent
partners. This puts both women and their children at increased risk of
violence.16 Unnecessary abortion restrictions place a burden on women
and result in unequal access. A study in Louisiana found the state's
admitting privileges law would result in widespread clinic closures,
more than tripling the average distance traveled for abortion
care---from 58 to 208 miles.17 The expense of abortion care is already
very high for some women; these types of restrictions may unfairly make
it accessible to only the wealthy.18 Limited access to abortion makes it
likely that self induction will become more common. Misoprostol is a
medically safe way to self-induce abortion, but it is not readily
available in the United States. Women are turning to less effective and
more dangerous methods---including taking herbs and inflicting abdominal
trauma.19 Conclusion Extensive medical, epidemiological, psychological
and sociological evidence proves that abortion is safe for women.
Research shows that current laws claiming to improve the safety of this
common medical procedure are more likely to harm women.]{.underline}**

**[In her response to President Trump\'s State of the Union address,
Stacey Abrams went through some of the top issues for the Democratic
Party. Health care. Climate change. Gun safety. Then she brought up a
topic Democrats are planning to spend a lot of time on over the next two
years: voting. \"Let\'s be clear. Voter suppression is real,\" Abrams
said. \"From making it harder to register and staying on the rolls, to
moving and closing polling places, to rejecting lawful ballots, we can
no longer ignore these threats to democracy.\" The past two federal
elections seem to have been a tipping point. The 2018 midterms featured
accusations of suppression in places where high-profile Democrats lost:
in Georgia with Abrams, and in Texas with Beto O\'Rourke. And in 2016,
Russian hackers attempted to break into state election systems
(succeeding in at least one state). President Trump also presents a
clear foil. He has continued to call for measures that would make voting
harder, like strict photo ID laws, without providing evidence for his
claims about widespread in-person voter fraud. \"I\'m running to fight
for an America where our democracy and its institutions are protected
against all enemies, foreign and domestic,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris,
D-Calif., at an event launching her presidential campaign last month.
\"We will secure our elections and our critical infrastructure to
protect our democracy.\" It remains unclear, however, whether any of
that energy will lead to concrete changes before a 2020 election that
cybersecurity experts are still worried about. House Democrats\' marquee
HR 1 bill has dozens of proposals they say would strengthen American
democracy, including requirements for states to use paper ballots and to
offer online voter registration, and it would make Election Day a
federal holiday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made
it clear, however, that the bill is going nowhere. \"Speaker Pelosi and
her colleagues are advertising it as a package of urgent measures to
save American democracy,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"What it
really seems to be is a package of urgent measures to rewrite the rules
of American politics for the exclusive benefit of the Democratic
Party.\" At a meeting with state election officials last weekend, Senate
staffers said lawmakers would reintroduce the bipartisan Secure
Elections Act in the next few weeks.]{.underline}**

Issue. Then Came the Gerrymandering Ruling."
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-gerrymandering-democrats.html)**

**[When the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Thursday that federal judges had
no power to stop partisan gerrymandering, it brought to a crushing end
decades-old questions about the court's willingness or ability to rein
in voting maps drawn to blatantly benefit one party. The ruling, after
years of escalating battles over voter identification laws, gerrymanders
and voter purges, left Democrats and voting rights advocates bitterly
disappointed. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has helped
lead the fight against Republican-drawn district maps, said in a
statement that the court's decision "tears at the fabric of our
democracy and puts the interests of the established few above the many."
He added, "History will not be kind in its assessment of the ways in
which this court has undermined voting rights and core democratic
principles in America." But rather than bringing any kind of finality,
the ruling will almost certainly increase the importance of voting
issues for the Democratic presidential candidates, many of whom have
already issued detailed proposals on voting laws, district lines,
gerrymandering and other issues surrounding American democracy. In
effect, the questions will move to state governments and courts, and to
Congress. \[What is gerrymandering, and why did the Supreme Court rule
on it?\] "All of the Democrats, I think, will feel obligated to be on
board with some kind of redistricting reform," said Barry C. Burden,
director of the Elections Research Center at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. "I think it guarantees that it's going to be a
prominent issue throughout this next election cycle." Democrats'
reaction was swift and nearly unanimous. Before a single word was spoken
on the debate stage Thursday night --- where gerrymandering was hardly
mentioned --- 18 of the 24 Democratic candidates had denounced the
ruling, describing it as a license for politicians and entrenched
interests to "rig the system." What the Supreme Court allowed was,
specifically, partisan gerrymandering: drawing district lines to give
one party an advantage. Gerrymandering based on protected classes, like
race, is illegal. But politicians who draw districts based on race are
not likely to admit it. This means it's up to judges to determine
whether a particular gerrymander was legally or illegally motivated, and
several candidates emphasized on Thursday that partisanship could now be
used as a pretense for racial discrimination. Republicans praised the
ruling just as decisively. The response to the ruling was divided,
almost without exception, along partisan lines. Austin Chambers,
president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which works to
elect Republicans to state legislatures, said in a statement that the
justices had "seen through the Democrats' latest desperate lawsuit and
confirmed that courts have no business deciding partisan political
disputes over redistricting." As Mr. Chambers's statement implied, the
ruling turned not on whether partisan gerrymandering was desirable but
whether it was an issue for federal courts to decide. And that was the
basis on which Republicans tended to praise it. "I think they ruled
exactly the way the Constitution says they're supposed to," said Larry
Shaheen, a Republican consultant and lawyer in North Carolina, where
Republican-drawn district maps were at issue in the case along with
Maryland's Democratic-drawn maps. "No answer is the right answer. There
is no answer that's the right answer for this, because this is a
situation that needs to be left to the voters." Several Democrats have
plans already. Michael Bennet has made voting rights a major theme of
his campaign. Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke and Bernie Sanders have all
released detailed plans. This week, Elizabeth Warren added her own. Cory
Booker and Seth Moulton, too, have called for a new Voting Rights Act
that would prohibit partisan gerrymandering. Mr. Bennet recently
introduced legislation in the Senate, the Fair Maps Act, that would do
the same. Ms. Warren wants to create a new federal agency called the
Secure Democracy Administration, replace old voting machines and ---
like several other candidates --- establish automatic voter
registration, same-day registration and early voting nationwide. Mr.
Buttigieg, Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Sanders support many of the same
policies, as well as more federal funding for elections. Mr. O'Rourke
has also called for federal legislation to hamstring state voter ID laws
and voter registration purges. But none have any real chance of passage
in a Republican-controlled Senate.]{.underline}**

Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) Context: At least ten black transgender women
have been reportedly killed this year, Vox reports. Booker appeared to
be responding to these statistics. The big picture: The Trump
administration has worked to undo a major chunk of LGBTQ protections
secured under President Obama --- with most of the effort directed
towards transgender rights. That includes: Rolling back an Obama-era
order allowing transgender people to openly serve in the U.S. military
Attempting to roll back protections for transgender people established
under the Affordable Care Act Telling the Supreme Court that federal law
doesn\'t protect transgender people from workplace discrimination
Removing Title IX protections for transgender youth Changing an
Obama-era policy allowing prisoners to be housed based on gender
identity. What else they\'re saying: At Wednesday\'s debate, former HUD
Secretary Julián Castro referenced transgender women while explaining
his stance on reproductive healthcare, saying trans women should have
\"the right to choose\" abortion access. Reality check: Transgender men
and non-binary people with a uterus can get pregnant and may choose to
obtain an abortion. Transgender women cannot get pregnant. Flashback:
Castro, Warren, and Biden made a point to include transgender people in
their reproductive health care spiels at a Planned Parenthood forum in

misogynistic place and that a candidate who doesn't get any white votes

CARTER Share quote & link Steven Reed, a candidate for mayor of
Montgomery, said that "looking for the safest bet is a recipe for
disappointment" in November 2020. "We need the best candidate with the
best ideas and with the best opportunity to win and then implement that
agenda," said Reed, a county probate judge who is neutral in Alabama's
March 3 primary. "I don't think playing it safe is the route Democrats
should take if they want to win, if they want to excite the base, if
they want to get out nontraditional voters and win over swing voters."
Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a left-leaning
political action committee, noted that Barack Obama initially faced deep
skepticism among African Americans, who strongly preferred Hillary
Clinton early in the 2008 contest. It was only after Obama beat Clinton
in Iowa and demonstrated his appeal to the state's white voters that
black supporters flocked to his candidacy, delivering him the Democratic
nomination. "People are nervous because the country is in such peril,"
Shropshire said. "People need to have some historical perspective."
Kamala Harris and Cory Booker embrace new era for black candidates » But
the stated willingness --- for now --- of many black voters to focus on
electability or settle for less than their ideal candidate is one reason
Biden has emerged as the early Democratic front-runner. It also points
up the challenges facing Harris and New Jersey's African American
senator, Cory Booker, who are banking on racial pride to help boost them
from the congested pack, and women like Massachusetts Sen. Warren, who
are counting on a measure of feminist solidarity. (On Friday, California
Sen. Harris paid her first 2020 campaign visit to Alabama, where she
criticized the state\'s stringent new anti-abortion law.) "My pragmatic
side says that the person that can win this election is someone more in
the middle, that's not going to come out for \[repealing\] the death
penalty and reparations," said Faya Touré, 74, a veteran civil rights
activist in Selma. She sat amid a museum-like collection of African art
in her law office, blocks from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where in 1965
blacks seeking the right to vote were clubbed and attacked with tear
gas. "I would love a candidate that would do that," Touré continued.
"But I don't think that candidate's going to win this election." Faya
Touré doubts a candidate who shares her views on abolishing the death
penalty and paying reparations for slavery could win the White House.
Faya Touré doubts a candidate who shares her views on abolishing the
death penalty and paying reparations for slavery could win the White
House. If Obama's history-making campaign was buoyed by hope and
aspiration, many black voters regard the 2020 election with feelings
more akin to resignation and risk aversion. Far from proving the
country's open-mindedness and racial progress, they said, the backlash
to the nation's first African American president only underscored its
deep and abiding racial divide. "What happened after we elected Obama?"
asked Touré. "Voter suppression laws. White supremacy. Hate crimes. The
tea party.... Without an Obama, there would never have been a Trump."
The litany of grievance among African Americans is deep and wide:
Trump's reference to black and brown "shithole countries," his
condemnation of black athletes protesting police abuse and racial
disparities, his equivocal response to the white supremacist march in
Charlottesville, Va. While black unemployment was 6.7% in April, the
lowest in decades, that has not translated into widespread African
American support for the president or his economic policies. A recent
survey conducted for BlackPAC found 90% of likely black voters believed
conditions had stagnated under Trump or gotten worse. A January Pew poll
gave him similarly poor marks. "The rich are getting richer, the poor
are getting poorer and the middle class is spiraling down, while all is
supposed to be right with the world," said Materia Gipson, 61, a retired
Birmingham schoolteacher who is shopping for a candidate even though she
looks favorably on Biden. Materia Gipson sees no improvement in the
economy under President Trump. The former senator from Delaware didn't
fare particularly well with African Americans in his two previous runs
for president. But now, at age 76, there is an old-shoe familiarity,
along with appreciation for Biden's unswerving loyalty as Obama's vice
president in the face of what many consider unfair and racially
motivated attacks. "The conversation in the barber shop and beauty
salons is that Biden was there for Obama, he had his back ... he's a
really close friend, so it makes them feel like they have a
relationship, even if they've never met him," said Anthony Daniels, who
leads Democrats in Alabama's House of Representatives. "A lot of times
in the African American community they don't trade old friends for new
friends." Parts of Biden's political past continue to rankle. More than
four decades ago, early in his Senate career, Biden was a vocal opponent
of busing aimed at school desegregation. As chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, he was widely criticized for his treatment of Anita Hill
during the 1991 confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas. Biden was also instrumental in passing a 1994 anti-crime bill
criticized for contributing to the mass incarceration of black
Americans. "Kids whose daddies suffered under Joe Biden aren't going to
forget," said Shante Wolfe-Sisson, a 25-year-old Birmingham political
activist, whose preference runs more toward the left-leaning Warren or
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Polls suggest that older African
Americans are more forgiving, supporting Biden to a greater extent than
young black voters. "We have to learn from things, and hopefully he
did," said Gipson, the retired Birmingham teacher, who brushed aside
controversies over Hill and Biden's tactile campaign style. "I want to
look at bigger issues than touching somebody or what happened to Anita
Hill. Some things you need to get past and look at the big picture."
Kenyan Carter, though, has a hard time getting past a lot of things he
doesn't like about Biden. **[[Kenyan Carter is no fan of Joe Biden. But
he\'ll vote for him if he\'s the Democratic nominee facing President
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He's out of touch, said the 21-year-old
University of South Alabama journalism student, as his mother, activist
Catrena Norris Carter, alternately shook her head and smiled
indulgently. He's too squishy when it comes to fighting climate change,
Kenyan Carter went on, and seems too beholden to corporate interests.
"Biden to me is how you get people like Trump," Carter said. "Biden is
how you get people disassociated from politics because you get people
like him in power." The younger Carter hasn't yet settled on a
candidate, but he volunteered last month at a Sanders rally in
Birmingham and loves "how scared \[Warren\] makes Wall Street people and
CEOs." That said, **[[Carter will vote for Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[--- grudgingly --- if he becomes the Democratic nominee.]{.mark}
[Anything, he said, to be rid of Trump.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The Third Way, a moderate Democratic group, is out with some
intriguing polling showing the preferences of 1,200 likely Democratic
primary voters. There's strong evidence that sticking to the center and
focusing on bread-and-butter issues just as Democrats did in 2018 will
pay dividends.]{.underline} Asked to name their top issues, voters
identified in order: Reducing the cost of health care (43 percent);
reducing taxes on the working and middle class (33 percent); addressing
climate change (30 percent); making the wealthy and corporations pay
more in taxes (27 percent); fixing our immigration system including
providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (27
percent); passing gun safety legislation (26 percent); passing a
single-payer, Medicare for All health plan (20 percent). Other issues
including free college and guaranteed jobs ranked much lower. Far and
away the two most important qualities (both at 43 percent) for a nominee
were standing up to President Trump when he threatens American values
and appealing to a broad range of [voters. In a series of questions
designed to contrast far-left and center-left views, the latter
prevailed by enormous margins: Works across party lines to bring the
country together and get things done, even if it means not getting
everything they want (83 percent) vs. Will be uncompromising in their
policy stances, standing firm even if it means policies may not be
passed (11 percent)]{.underline} Will focus on expanding opportunity to
more people and places (59 percent) vs. Will focus on reducing income
inequality (33 percent) [Moves further to the left to generate
enthusiasm and increase participation among progressives and liberals
(22 percent) vs. Appeals to a broad range of voters, including people
who may have voted for Trump in 2016 (70 percent)]{.underline} Has the
best chance to beat Donald Trump (65 percent) vs. Most closely matches
my policy preferences (28 percent) [Would you rather see a Democratic
candidate for president who says we should mend, but not end capitalism
(55 percent) vs. one who calls himself a Democratic Socialist (23
percent)]{.underline} Would you rather see someone who offers ideas that
shift the national debate but may take many years to accomplish (14
percent) vs. one who offers ideas that address urgent problems affecting
people today (79 percent) A candidate who wants to put a limit on
out-of-pocket costs and insure everyone (44 percent) vs. A candidate who
wants to pass a single-payer, Medicare for All government-run plan (32
percent) Abolishing ICE (26 percent) vs. not abolishing (50 percent)
Putting many of these together, the pollsters asked if voters wanted A)
A candidate who favored single-payer government-run health-care plan for
all Americans, sometimes called Medicare for All, a guaranteed
government job for all Americans, free college for all Americans OR B) A
candidate who supports creating 1 million new apprenticeship positions,
making sure every American who works has a private retirement account on
top of Social Security, and building on Obamacare to limit out-of-pocket
health care costs and insure everyone. Candidate A got 32 percent,
Candidate B 49 percent. [Many more Democrats said they wanted their
party to be more moderate (45 percent) than to be more progressive (21
percent).]{.underline} And these voters overwhelmingly thought a new
Amazon headquarters would have positive (60 percent) rather than a
negative (20 percent) impact on their community. (Jeffrey P. Bezos is
the owner of The Washington Post and founder and chief executive of
Amazon). It should not be surprising that former vice president Joe
Biden is the clear leader in the "best chance" to beat Trump, with Sens.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and former Texas
congressman Beto O'Rourke a distance back. What we don't know is whether
these results reflect name ID or ideological preference. Now, do not
confuse Democrats with Republicans. By wide margins Democratic primary
voters want to tax the rich more (83 percent, 50 percent very strongly).
They favor activist government in the tradition of past Democratic
presidents. [However, neither Sanders nor firebrands like Rep.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are representative of the primary
electorate, although you might not guess so based on the media coverage.
Candidates racing far to the left may want to rethink their approach.
The smarter move would seem to be to be progressive
"enough.\"]{.underline}** **The poll of 1,200 likely 2020 Democratic

#### With the history of voting as an ineffective practice there would be no reason for black people to vote. Voting only leads to redlining, and political subjectivity which reproduces the politics of despair.

#### **Warren 15** {Calvin L.; George Washington University; "Black Nihilism and the Politics of Hope"; CR: The New Centennial Review, Vol 15 Number 1, Michigan State University Press; Spring; accessed 8/18/15 @ 8:40PM}MHELLIE

To speak of [**the "Politics of Hope**" **is to denaturalize or
demystify a certain usage of hope**]{.underline}. Here I want to make a
**[distinction between "hope"]{.underline}** (the spiritual concept)
**[and "the politics of hope]{.underline}**" (political hope). The
relationship between the spiritual concept of hope and its use as a
political instrument is the focus of the black nihilist critique.2
Following Kant and other postmetaphysical philosophers, the critical
field questions (and in some circles completely denounces) a [certain
spiritual predisposition to the world---that "unknowable" noumenon that
limits Reason but provides the condition of possibility for its
organization of the world of perception, phenomenon.]{.underline} The
problem with the critical questioning of the spiritual is that it often
appropriates spiritual concepts and then, insidiously, translates them
[into the "scientific" or the knowable,]{.underline} [as a way to both
capitalize on the mystic power of the spiritual and to preserve the
spiritual under the guise of "enlightened understanding." We find this
deceptive translation and capitalization of spiritual substance within
the sphere of the Political---that organization of social existence
through political institutions, mandates, logics, and
grammars]{.underline}---as a way to govern and discipline beings. If we
think of hope as a spiritual concept---a concept that always escapes
confinement within scientific discourse---then we can suggest that
**[hope constitutes a "spiritual currency" that we are given as an
inheritance to invest in various aspects of existence]{.underline}**.
The issue, however, is that [**there is often a compulsory investment of
this spiritual substance in the Political**. **This is the forced
destination of hope**---**it must end up in the Political and cannot
exist outside of it**]{.underline} (or any existence of hope "outside"
the political subverts, compromises, and destroys hope itself. Like
placing a fish out of water. It is as if hope only has intelligibility
and efficacy within and through the Political). Put differently, the
**[politics of hope posits that one must have a politics to have
hope]{.underline}**; politics is the natural habitat of hope itself.
**[[To reject hope in a nihilistic way]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then,
**[[is really to reject the politics of hope, or certain circumscribed
and compulsory forms of expressing, practicing, and conceiving of
hope]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the essay "A Fidelity to Politics: Shame
and the African American Vote in the 2004 Election," Grant Farred (2006)
exposes a kernel of irrationality at the center of African American
political participation. Traditionally, political participation is
motivated by self-interested expectancy; this political calculus assumes
that political participation, particularly voting, is an investment with
an assurance of a return or political dividend. **[The structure of the
Political]{.underline}**---the [**circular movement between
self-interest, action, and reward**--- **is**]{.underline} sustained
through what Farred calls the "**[electoral unconscious." It
"historicizes the subject in relation to the political in that it
determines the horizon of what is possible it maps,]{.underline}**
through its delimitation or its (relative) lack of limits, what the
constituency and its members imagine they can, or, would like to expect
from the political" (217). In this way, the electoral unconscious, as
the realm of political fantasy, mirrors the Lacanian notion of fantasy;
it maps the coordinates of the political subject and teaches it how
exactly to desire the Political. For Farred, there is a peculiar logic
("another scene") operating as the motivation for African American
participation in the Political. Unlike the traditional political
calculus, where action and reward determine civic engagement, African
American participation does not follow this rational calculus---because
if it did, [**[there]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}**]{.mark}
actually **[[be no rational reason for African Americans to vote, given
the historicity of voting as an ineffective practice in gaining tangible
"objects" for achieving redress, equality, and political
subjectivity.]{.mark} African Americans]{.underline}**, according to
Farred, **[have an "irrational fidelity" to a practice
that]{.underline}**, historically, **[has yielded no concrete
transformations of antiblackness]{.underline}**. This group is governed
not by the "electoral unconscious" but by the "historical conscious,"
which is the "intense \[and incessant\] understanding of how the
franchise has been achieved, of its precarious preciseness as well as
their (growing) contemporary liminality, their status as marginalized
political subjects" (217). African Americans are a faithful voting block
not because of voting's political efficaciousness but as a way to
contend with a painful (and shame-full) history of exclusion and
disenfranchisement. Political participation becomes an act of historical
commemoration and obligation; one votes because someone bled and died
for the opportunity to participate, and "duty" and "indebtedness"
motivate this partial political subject. Within this piece, we get a
sense that black fidelity to the Political is tantamount to the Lacanian
notion of drive---one perpetuates a system designed to
annihilate---participation, then, follows another logic. The act of
voting, according to Farred, is legitimate in and of itself; it is a
means as an end (or a means without an end, if we follow Agamben's logic
\[2000\]). The means, the praxis of voting, is all there is without an
end in sight. [**African American [political participation is an
interminable cycle of reproduction,]{.mark} a continuous practice of
reproducing the means of reproduction itself.** [**This irrational
fidelity** **to a means without an end gives rise to "the politics of
despair**]{.mark}]{.underline}
