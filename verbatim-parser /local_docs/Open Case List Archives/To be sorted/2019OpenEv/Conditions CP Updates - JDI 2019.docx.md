the State Dept Refuses To Trace Whether Israel Is Using U.S. Military
Aid Illegally

[Israel's army has long deployed U.S. weapons to kill Palestinian
civilians.]{.underline}

An In These Times survey of detailed reports published by the United
Nations, Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International reveals that, [since 2009, at least 272
Palestinians appear to have been killed by U.S.-made weapons used by
Israeli forces.]{.underline}

[Fourteen of these killings occurred during law enforcement situations
(outside of an active war zone), such as during
demonstrations]{.underline}. Some of these incidents have been captured
on video. In one video from 2016, for example, an Israeli soldier, armed
with a U.S.-made M4 assault rifle, executed an injured Palestinian who
was lying still on a Hebron street after he stabbed a soldier.

[The full death toll of Palestinians killed by U.S. weapons is likely
far higher, since many reports are not able to identify the weapon
used.]{.underline}

It's not supposed to be this way. [U.S. arms exports to Israel (and
other countries) are governed by laws placing restrictions on sales to
nations that abuse human rights. Campaigns to cut U.S. military aid to
Israel have latched onto a particular measure, known as the Leahy Law.
The law prohibits U.S. assistance or training from flowing to foreign
military units that have committed a gross violation of human rights,
unless the foreign government has held that unit
accountable]{.underline}.

But interviews with human rights advocates, congressional aides and
former and current U.S. officials reveal that [enforcement of the Leahy
Law in Israel is lax, with no tracking of which army units receive U.S.
weapons.]{.underline}

[Human rights advocates say they have brought the State Department
evidence of specific crimes committed by soldiers who clearly used U.S.
weapons, only to have that evidence brushed off. A current U.S.
official]{.underline}, who asked for anonymity because they are not
authorized to speak to the press and could be fired as a result[, told
In These Times that they are not aware of any time when an Israeli unit
was cut off from U.S. assistance under the Leahy Law.]{.underline}

This [lack of enforcement allows Israel to get away with extrajudicial
executions of Palestinians, human rights advocates say.]{.underline}

Maria [LaHood, deputy legal director at the Center for Constitutional
Rights, says the United States' "unparalleled support for Israel" gives
it leverage to end these extrajudicial killings if it chooses. "Our
government does not lack the legal tools to put an end to Israel's human
rights violations," she says. "It lacks the political
will."]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Leahy's Law

#### Israel commits gross violations of human rights -- aid should be halted and they must be held accountable

**Shihadah 18**

(Kathryn Shihadah, Kathryn Shihadah is a staff writer for If Americans
Knew, If Americans Knew: Leahy Law would cut aid to Israel, but no one
wants to enforce it,
https://israelpalestinenews.org/leahy-law-would-cut-aid-to-israel-but-no-one-wants-to-enforce-it/,
4/19/18 \[NS\])

[The Leahy Laws were designed to uphold human rights in countries that
receive United States aid. These laws enable the US to withhold military
assistance from units and individuals in foreign security forces if they
have committed a gross violation of human rights (GVHR).]{.underline}
The laws -- one for the State Department and a similar one for the
Department of Defense -- are implemented through a vetting process based
on annual Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights, reports
from reliable NGOs, and other sources[. According to principal sponsor
Senator Leahy (D-VT), the legislation "makes it clear that when credible
evidence of human rights violations exists, US aid must
stop."]{.underline} GVHRs (Gross Violations of Human Rights) that can
trigger Leahy include [extrajudicial killing torture or cruel, inhuman,
or degrading treatment or punishment prolonged detention without charges
and trial causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction and
clandestine detention of those persons other flagrant denial of the
right to life, liberty, or the security of person politically motivated
rape]{.underline} Since its founding in 1948, Israel has received nearly
\$125 billion in aid from the US; the current rate amounts to over \$10
million a day. Is anyone keeping an eye on the recipient of 50% of our
total foreign military aid? The answer is a resounding Yes. An observer
from the Temporary International Presence in Hebron videotapes clashes
between Palestinians and Israeli troops November 7, 2000 in the
marketplace in the West Bank town of Hebron. Dozens of NGOs monitor and
report on Israel's actions; our State Department has generated a Country
Report on Human Rights every year since 1976. [If Israel is regularly
committing GVHRs, it is easily verifiable.]{.underline} \[See below for
additional U.S. laws that Israel violates\] The Great March of Freedom
The border between occupied Gaza and Israel is the site of a 6-week mass
protest which started on March 30th and is planned to last till May
15th, 2018. The event, called the Great March of Freedom, recalls
several important events in Palestinian history. March 30th is Land Day,
when Palestinians commemorate that moment in 1976 in which Israel
institutionalized the theft of Palestinian land, the day that Israeli
forces killed 6 peaceful protesters. May 15th is Independence Day in
Israel, but for Palestinians it is Nakba Day, commemorating the
"catastrophe" in which Israel took over 78% of their land in 1948 and
sent 800,000 Palestinians into exile. Within months, the United Nations
passed a resolution guaranteeing them the right of return to their land
and homes. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza -- 70% of whom are
refugees from 1948 or their descendants -- have been gathering
nonviolently to protest the occupation and blockade of their land, and
to demand the right of return. [Israeli forces have responded to unarmed
Palestinians with snipers and live fire**, killing at least 32 and
injuring over 2,870**]{.underline} in the first 3 weeks of the Great
March. [Most of the world has condemned Israel's actions from the start,
as it did for many Israeli incursions into Palestinian territory which
resulted in massive casualties. In fact most of the world has criticized
Israel for consistently for years]{.underline}. Pro-Israel NGO UN Watch
has been tracking global censure of Israel in the United Nations since
1993 with the stated goal of "monitor\[ing\] the performance of the UN
by the yardstick of its own Charter" and the unspoken objective of
proving that the UN has an anti-Israel bias. The organization reports:
UN Human Rights Council: From its creation in June 2006 through June
2016, 68 out of 135 resolutions (over 50%) have been against Israel UN
Nations General Assembly: From 2012 through 2015, 83 out of 97
resolutions (86%) have been against Israel UNESCO: Each year, this body
adopts around 10 resolutions a year criticizing only Israel (UNESCO does
not criticize any other UN member state in a country-specific resolution
-- except Syria once in 2013) [Although Israel is a signatory of the
Geneva Conventions, it has also chosen to disregard parts of this
international treaty as well.]{.underline} In [spite of worldwide
outcry, and with the Leahy Laws on the books for years, American
military aid to Israel has increased year after year]{.underline}.
American politicians apparently don't find Israel's actions worthy of
reprimand. Human Rights [Israel regularly uses a broad definition of
"terrorist" to excuse human rights abuses against
Palestinians]{.underline}. When soldiers shot a boy in the face, they
explained that he was climbing the wall around their compound -- he
might have been a terrorist. When they detained a 3-year-old child who
was running toward them with a zucchini scraper -- they pointed out that
he might be booby-trapped. [When 2 million people are denied medicine
and food for 10 years, it is easily rationalized]{.underline}: they
support Hamas, which shoots rockets into Israel. In Defense Minister
Avigdor Lieberman's words, "There are no innocent people in the Gaza
Strip." [And now: killing and injuring unarmed, nonviolent protesters is
justifiable because Israel's border is sacred]{.underline} and must not
be approached, let alone compromised. "The border fence between Israel
and the Gaza Strip separates a sovereign state and a terrorist
organization." [Israel justifies the use of lethal force against
peaceful protesters -- and decades of other illegal or questionable
actions -- so effectively that American politicians remain unwavering in
their loyalty]{.underline}. American taxpayers need to judge the virtue
of the Israeli rationale on the basis of hard facts. Set Israel's
actions next to the Leahy list of gross violations of human rights, [and
it becomes clear that it time for the Leahy Laws to be enforced. It is
past time.]{.underline} [Extrajudicial killing violates international
law]{.underline} International law restricts the lethal use of firearms
to a last resort; however, Israeli officials have repeatedly contravened
this standard in public statements. After the first weekend of the Great
March, army spokespeople indicated that all of the Palestinians killed
had been taking violent action or tampering with the border fence, and
at least 10 of the victims were members of Hamas. They were all executed
without trial. On the second weekend of the March, Gazan journalist
Yasser Murtaja, who was lethally shot while wearing a clearly marked
"PRESS" vest, was rebuffed by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman as a
"Hamas terrorist[." No evidence was produced. The U.S. State Department
had vetted him and he was set to receive funds from USAID. Murtaja was
executed without trial.]{.underline} These were not aberrant killings by
rogue soldiers: [Israeli leaders regularly encourage extrajudicial
killing and excessive force.]{.underline} Transportation Minister
Yisrael Katz stated in 2016, that "we cannot let attackers remain alive,
risking the lives of Jews." In 2015, Jerusalem Police District Commander
Moshe Edri stated that "Everyone who stabs Jews or harms innocent people
-- should be killed." Also in 2015, Israeli Police Minister Gilad Erdan
declared that "if a terrorist has a knife or screwdriver in his hand,
you should shoot to kill him without thinking twice." He added, "every
attacker who sets out to inflict harm should know that he will likely
not survive the attack." And Avigdor Lieberman, who is now defense
minister, advocated in a 2015 Facebook post for a policy in which "no
attacker, male or female, should make it out of any attack alive."
Defense for Children International-Palestine reports that 2015 saw
Israeli forces execute at least 28 Palestinian children alone, thanks in
part to the environment created by its leaders and a broad shoot-to-kill
policy. Amnesty International has also been tracking Israel's
extrajudicial killings for years. The Leahy Laws remain untouched.
Torture Torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
is another Leahy trigger. In international law, torture is forbidden; in
Israeli law, a small window called "extraordinary circumstances" has
enabled authorities to make abundant use of the practice. Palestinians
have registered least 1,000 complaints of torture since 2000, but this
year -- 2018 -- is the first time one has led to a criminal
investigation. The rest were summarily dismissed. Abdel Nasser Farwana,
head of the Palestinian Detainees and Ex-Detainees Committee Studies and
Documentation Unit, reports that 71 Palestinian prisoners have died from
torture since 1967, and dozens of others have died shortly after
release. Farwana adds, "Israel...is the only country in the world that
legalizes torture in its jails and detention camps and protects its
perpetrators. Israel uses torture on institutional level against
Palestinian and Arab detainees." A report in Foreign Service Journal
reported that Israeli torture has also extended at times to American
citizens. [The Leahy Law should have kicked in years ago, cutting off
aid to Israel's prison establishment]{.underline}. Prolonged detention
without charges and trial Administrative detention is a process meant
only for rare cases: for a detainee who has not committed an offense, on
the grounds that s/he plans to break the law at some future time. The
detainee is not charged and does not stand trial. Like torture,
administrative detention is overused in Israel. In a recent report,
Addameer reveals that during the first 2 months of 2018, Israeli forces
had already detained 1319 Palestinians, including 274 children, 23
women, and 4 journalists. Since 2000, Israel has detained at least
12,000 children alone. Addameer crunched the numbers and found that
since 1967, more than 800,000 Palestinians have been detained. This
amounts to approximately 20% of the total Palestinian population in the
occupied Palestinian territories, and upwards of 40% of the total male
Palestinian population. Approximately 10,000 women have been detained
since 2000. While international law permits detention without trial
under extremely limited, emergency circumstances, critics argue that
Israel has exploited the measure, instituting it on a massive scale, and
denying detainees due process. Ultimately, about 95% of detainees are
released without charge or trial. B'tselem summarizes the practice: The
power to incarcerate people who have not been convicted or even charged
with anything for lengthy periods of time, based on secret "evidence"
that they cannot challenge, is an extreme power. Israel uses it
continuously and extensively, routinely holding hundreds of Palestinians
at any given moment...Israel also exploits this measure to detain
Palestinians for their political opinions and for engaging in
non-violent political activity. [How many more years does Israel need to
misappropriate administrative detention before the Leahy Law is
activated?]{.underline} Abduction and clandestine detention The Women's
Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling (WCLAC), a Palestinian NGO,
estimates that the Israeli military conducts nearly 1,400 night raids
per year (in addition to daytime operations) -- over 65,000 since 1967.
These raids have been heavily criticized by human rights organizations
as especially damaging to children. Usually conducted around 2 am, they
start with loud banging on the door or an explosion to blast the door
open. Homes are ransacked, family members threatened, and children often
see a parent abducted -- or are abducted themselves during these raids.
On one night in August 2017, 15 Palestinians were detained in a single
raid in East Jerusalem; 160 were arrested in 12 days in July 2017, 30 of
them minors. Israeli security forces arrest a Palestinian woman outside
Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the old city of Jerusalem, July 26, 2015.
(AFP Photo/Ahmad Gharbali) Politically motivated rape Actual rape has
been reported in Israeli prisons: in 2005, doctors verified the violent
abuse of a Lebanese prisoner by an Israeli interrogator; counselors have
witnessed confidential descriptions from Palestinian women of rape by
Israeli soldiers. Rasmea Odeh has publicly discussed horrific torture
and rape. While the subject of rape is socially taboo in Palestine and
statistics are impossible to gather, it is important to note that the
United Nations Istanbul Protocol states that "verbal sexual threats,
abuse and mocking are also part of sexual torture." In the Palestinian
culture, threats of a sexual nature are a very serious matter, and are
globally they are considered to be a form of torture. According to a
2017 report from Addameer, the practices of sexual harassment, threats
of rape (directed at themselves and family members), sexually degrading
insults, and strip and body searching of female prisoners are "common
and systematic." Male prisoners have been somewhat more willing to speak
up on the subject. Israeli clinical psychologist Daniel J.N. Weishut
published a report in 2015 which reveals that "[Israeli authorities are
systemically involved with torture and ill-treatment of a sexual
nature]{.underline}." He also notes that while dozens of cases have come
up, no convictions have been returned; in all but one case, the
complaints were rejected by the authorities. [In 2010, a study by
Defense for Children International-Palestine led to the conclusion that
"sexual harassment and sexual abuse" have been used across the board in
the interrogation of child prisoners]{.underline}. Other flagrant denial
of the right to life, liberty, or the security of person Statistics on
punitive demolitions of Palestinian homes are easy to find; as are
reports on the demolitions of entire villages, destruction of crops,
collective punishment, and unnecessary delays at checkpoints even for
medical emergencies. The list is long. This is in addition to the
ongoing theft of land and resources, the ongoing blockade of Gaza and
occupation of both Gaza and the West Bank, and other human rights
abuses. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks before a joint
session of Congress, March 3, 2015. Photo: Heather Reed / flickr
Accountability [Implementing the Leahy Law, the U.S. government vets
foreign security forces to ensure that aid recipients have not committed
gross human rights abuses, and engages with governments to promote
accountability and measures to prevent future abuses. The purpose of the
Leahy Law is to hold states accountable for their actions. **Israel
considers itself immune from accountability**, all the while collecting
over \$10 million a day in military aid from the United States. The
Jewish State makes little attempt to hide its human rights
abuses.]{.underline} Even before the Great March of Return began,
Israeli rhetoric and actions pointed to a massacre. Prime Minister
Netanyahu employed at least 100 snipers, with orders to shoot anyone
trying to breach the border fence. Senior IDF officers were quoted as
saying that they were perfectly willing to produce a high body count: it
was a "price \[Israel\] would be willing to pay to prevent a breach" of
the border fence. After the first weekend of the Gaza Great March of
Return, condemnation came from (almost) all sides and calls for
investigation from both the UN secretary-general and the EU chief of
foreign policy. Israel's Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman would have
none of it: "Israeli soldiers did what was necessary. I think all our
soldiers deserve a medal." He added, "As for a commission of inquiry --
there won't be one." In fact, quite the opposite was true. Major General
Yoav Mordechai, Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories,
called on the World Health Organization (WHO) to restrain Gazans who
planned to burn tires during the second weekend of protest. Mordechai
insisted that it was "irresponsible behavior" that would cause
"unprecedented air pollution. This is part of an ongoing pattern of
blatant refusal of accountability. In 2016, after being denied entrance
to the occupied Palestinian territories for 18 months, UN rapporteur for
human rights Makarim Wibisono gave up and resigned his position.
Israel's foreign ministry spokesman explained the refusal: "Israeli
human rights are violated too, every day, by Palestinians, and until
this ends the council will not be taken seriously as a body that
respects human rights." [In 2016, 10 Congress people -- one of which was
Senator Leahy -- sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, urging
him to investigate extrajudicial killings and other possible GVHRs in
Israel, and recommending application of the Leahy Law.]{.underline} When
Netanyahu got wind of the letter, his response was swift and decisive:
The IDF and Israeli police do not engage in executions. Israel's
soldiers and police officers defend themselves and innocent civilians
with the highest moral standards against bloodthirsty terrorists who
come to murder them. The Prime Minister was apparently comfortable
making this statement, in spite of the fact that a week earlier, Israeli
soldier Elor Azaria had been caught on video shooting a Palestinian man
in the head at zero range, as the man lay wounded and unarmed on the
ground. (Netanyahu later called for pardon for Azaria, stating that
there had already been enough pain "first and foremost for Elor and his
family, IDF soldiers, and many citizens and parents of our soldiers,
myself included.") The viral video notwithstanding, Netanyahu also
called Secretary Kerry and insisted that he go on record declaring that
Israel is not guilty of extrajudicial assassinations. All of this was in
the context of Netanyahu's panhandling to increase military aid from the
United States to \$4.5 billion a year. In 2011, then Israeli Defense
Minister Ehud Barak literally got away with murder when the Leahy Law
came under discussion. Barak explained to Senator Leahy, "the difference
between Israel and terror groups or other countries in the Middle East
is that we give an accounting and there is monitoring." He also reminded
the senator that Palestinians who feel they have been wronged are
welcome to approach the High Court of Justice. According to B'tselem,
this judicial body routinely refuses to grant any semblance of justice
to Palestinians. [The vast majority of US politicians are enablers of
Israel in its crimes.]{.underline} In 2015, Israel launched an attack on
Gaza, "Operation Protective Edge," in which over 2,000 Palestinians died
and 10,000 were injured (71 Israelis were killed and 1,300 were
injured). Rather than censuring Netanyahu for this ferocious attack,
President Obama agreed to sell Israel \$1.9 billion in arms -- this in
addition to the extra munitions Israel helped itself to when running low
on mortar rounds and grenades just 2 weeks into that incursion. A
Pentagon spokesman commented on Palestinian casualties: "[The high
civilian death toll makes clear that Israel can and must do more to meet
its own high standards for protecting civilians from being
killed."]{.underline} The spokesman was quick to state America's eternal
support for "Israel's right to defend itself." While turning a blind eye
to its own human rights abuses, Israel takes up the gauntlet against
Palestinians when it comes to any resistance, even when it is
nonviolent. The Gaza Great March of Return is regularly recast as a
"violent movement" or a "cover for terrorism"; the BDS movement is "an
existential threat to the existence of the state." Meanwhile, up on the
Hill The Leahy Laws allow for waivers: if a country fails the vetting
process, State Department may call for an exception if the foreign
government "has taken all necessary corrective steps," or in the event
of "humanitarian or national security emergencies." DOD can also waive
the prohibition on funding in "extraordinary circumstances"; in such
cases, the Secretary of Defense is required by law to report to Congress
the nature of the GVHR as well as the "circumstances that necessitate
the waiver." [But with all the human rights violations going on in
Israel-Palestine even today, the Leahy law sits on the
shelf.]{.underline} Our Congress people (with a few notable exceptions)
drink the Koolaid, take the campaign donations from AIPAC and other
lobbies,, and sign the checks. If they have read the annual Department
of State Country Reports on Human Rights, or the multitude of human
rights reports from nongovernmental organizations, there has been no
impact. To understand why, read They Dare to Speak Out or The Israel
Lobby, (shorter version here). On the contrary, Congress has pushed
through the Taylor Force Act, which is harmful to Palestinians; both
houses are currently entertaining anti-BDS laws --the House version
contains strong wording that opposes a United Nations Human Rights
Council resolution. When the TV cameras are rolling, or the lobbyists
are outside the door (read: all the time), it would appear that our
Congressional representatives do not really believe in human rights
after all -- at least when those humans are Palestinian.

### Solvency - Generic

#### US can and should condition successfully

Forward: It's Time to End America's Blank Check Military Aid to Israel
<https://forward.com/opinion/424591/its-time-to-end-americas-blank-check-military-aid-to-israel/>
5/20/19 \[aw\]

The United States should not condition off-shore procurement on the
creation of a Palestinian state since creating one is not solely within
Israel's power. But [America can use off-shore procurement as leverage
to keep Israel from foreclosing a Palestinian state. The US can insist
that Israel not annex any part of the West Bank.]{.underline}
(Palestinian leaders have in the past suggested that Israel could annex
certain settlements as part of a two-state deal, but only in return for
land inside Israel proper. If Israel annexes settlements unilaterally
and without compensation, the basis for that trade disappears).

[The US can also insist that Israel stop settlement growth, which eats
away at the territory on which Palestinians would establish their state
(and which often involves the theft of land that individual Palestinians
own).]{.underline} [In 2017, according to Israel's Central Bureau of
Statistics, the settler population grew at close to double the rate of
the Israeli population as a whole. That's partly because the Israeli
government essentially pays Jews to move into the West Bank by
allocating far more government money to settlements than to cities and
towns inside Israel proper.]{.underline}

Finally, [while the United States cannot demand that Israelis and
Palestinians reach a two-state deal, it can demand that the Israeli
government accept the basic outlines of one, as detailed in the Clinton
parameters in 2000 and the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, as Mahmoud
Abbas has done, and negotiate on that basis.]{.underline} Israel can
refuse. But then America can refuse to stop allowing Israel to spend
American money on Israeli arms.

Like the first, [this second form of conditionality would elicit howls
from the Israeli and American Jewish political establishments, which
would accuse the US of undermining Israeli security. But it's worth
remembering that, overwhelmingly, Israel's top security officials
consider the two-state solution safer than permanent
occupation]{.underline}. In 2015, one former head of the Mossad,
Israel's external security agency, Meir Dagan, warned that Netanyahu's
policies toward the Palestinians were "leading to either a binational
state or an apartheid state." In 2017, another former Mossad head, Tamir
Pardo, called the death of the two-state solution an "existential
threat" to Israel. Such views are widespread. In 2016, Major General
Gadi Shamni, former head of Israel's Central Command, which encompasses
the West Bank, noted that, "The overwhelming majority of the senior
ranks of the defense establishment think we are moving in very
problematic directions in regard to the Palestinians. For every 50
people who think as I do, you'll find \[only\] one or two who espouse a
different view." That same year, a Likud member of the Knesset quipped
that "there is something that happens" to the people who run Israel's
security agencies that "makes them left-wing."

This may sound strange to Americans. How could Israelis, who prize
security, elect leaders who are entrenching an occupation that so many
Israeli security professionals consider dangerous? But it's not that
strange: Ideologues overrule security professionals in our political
system too. The Pentagon considers climate change a grave threat to
national security; Donald Trump considers it a Chinese hoax. The police
condemn laws that make it easier to own a gun. Police-loving Republicans
pass them anyway.

By conditioning off-shore procurement, [the United States can prod and
empower those in Israel's security establishment who fear permanent
occupation to more forcefully oppose it. And America can weaken
Netanyahu by showing ordinary Israelis that his policies undermine
Israel's most important relationship.]{.underline} As B'Tselem's Hagai
El-Ad has argued, "Perpetuating the occupation and paying no price for
it -- having it both ways -- is Netanyahu's single goal. Breaking...that
mold is the biggest hope we have of finally ending the occupation." With
this shift in policy, Democrats can keep this hope alive.

### Leverage

#### Arms sales are a key point of US leverage over Israel

<https://ips-dc.org/us_arms_transfers_and_security_assistance_to_israel/>

U.S. press coverage of Israeli attacks on the Palestinian Authority and
Palestinian towns on the West Bank often treat the U.S. government as
either an innocent bystander or an honest broker in the current
conflict, often without giving a full sense of the importance of [the
U.S. role as a supplier of arms, aid, and military technology to
Israel]{.underline}. [In its role as Israel's primary arms supplier, the
United States could exert significant potential leverage over Israeli
behavior in the conflict, if it would choose to do so.]{.underline}

Military and Economic Aid

[Since 1976, Israel has been the largest annual recipient of U.S.
foreign assistance.]{.underline} According to a November 2001
Congressional Research Service report, Israel: U.S. Foreign Assistance,
U.S. aid to Israel in the last half century has totaled a whopping
\$81.3 billion.

Today, Israel remains the top recipient of U.S. military and economic
assistance. The most commonly cited figure is \$3 billion a year, with
about \$1.8 billion a year in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grants
from the Department of Defense and an additional \$1.2 billion a year in
Economic Support Funds (ESF) from the Department of State. In the past
decade FMF grants to Israel have totaled \$18.2 billion. In fact, 17% of
all U.S. foreign aid is earmarked for Israel.

For 2003, the Bush administration is proposing that Israel receive
\$2.76 billion in foreign aid, with \$2.1 billion in FMF and \$600
million in ESF. An additional \$28 million will go to Israel for the
purchase U.S. manufactured counter terrorism equipment.

Weapons Sales and Grants

[Israel is one of the United States' largest arms importers. In the past
decade, the United States has sold Israel \$7.2 billion in weaponry and
military equipment, \$762 million through Direct Commercial Sales (DCS),
more than \$6.5 billion through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
program.]{.underline}

In fact, [Israel is so devoted to U.S. military hardware that it has the
world's largest fleet of F-16s outside the U.S]{.underline}., currently
possessing more than 200 jets. Another 102 F-16s are on order from
Lockheed Martin.

[The United States has also underwritten Israel's domestic armaments
industry]{.underline}, by giving:

\$1.3 billion to develop the Lavi aircraft (cancelled)

\$625 million to develop and deploy the Arrow anti-missile missile (an
ongoing project)

\$200 million to develop the Merkava tank (operative); the latest
version, the Merkava 4, uses a German V-12 diesel engine produced under
license in the U.S. by General Dynamics

\$130 million to develop the high-energy laser anti-missile system
(ongoing).

While overall aid to Israel is slated to decrease over the next five
years, military aid will increase significantly. One of President
Clinton's last acts was to sign an agreement with Israel, phasing out
the ESF by 2008. At the same time, FMF funds to Israel will increase
\$60 million each year, reaching \$2.4 billion by 2008.

Rodman\'s study of U.S. arms transfers to Israel provides important
insight into this critical and oft-misunderstood element of the
strategic relationship. Relying on extensive U.S. archival research, the
book details the evolution of this relationship from Israel\'s early
reliance on Western European equipment through the start of U.S. arms
sales during the Johnson era to the end of the Reagan administration.

Rodman\'s thesis is that [arms sales have provided Washington with
critical leverage over Israel, enabling the United States to \"wring
concessions out of Israel in order to advance American national
interests,\" particularly during Middle East wars.]{.underline} For
Israel\'s part, according to Rodman, [weapons purchases from the United
States constitute an acceptable sacrifice of autonomy for
security]{.underline}. The slender volume is a quick and absorbing read
and is full of well-footnoted examples illustrating the complicated
dynamics of U.S. and Israeli decision-making related to weapons sales.

[The argument is convincing. Rodman points out that U.S. efforts to
influence other Israeli policies via this lever, such as its pursuit of
a nuclear weapons program, have proved decidedly less effective except
during Middle East wars, when, as Rodman argues, U.S. influence on
Israeli policy has been dramatic.]{.underline} [In 1967, pressure from
Washington forced Israeli restraint in the face of Egyptian
provocations, such as the closure of the Straits of Tiran. When the
United States recognized the futility of diplomacy, Rodman says,
Washington gave the Jewish state a tacit \"green light\" to embark on
war. The same held true,]{.underline} Rodman points out, [during the
1969-70 War of Attrition when Israel was compelled to stop its bombing
raids against Egypt after Washington threatened to withhold the military
aid and diplomatic support necessary for the raids to
continue.]{.underline}

In perhaps the most striking example[, in 1973 U.S. pressure appears to
have dissuaded the government of Israel from taking preemptive military
action against Syria and Egypt.]{.underline} \"Caught between the Israel
Defense Forces General Staff and the Nixon administration,\" Rodman
says, \"the Meir government chose to follow the position of Israel\'s
patron rather than the advice of its own military experts.\" After the
outbreak of hostilities, the Meir government accepted the Nixon
administration\'s cease-fire proposal because, Rodman writes, Israel had
no alternative but to \"trade the postwar concessions desired by the
United States for continued American \[military\] support.\"

As Rodman deftly points out[, Israel\'s conduct during the 1967-1973
period is \"not comprehensible unless it is examined in the context of
the American-Israeli patron-client relationship.\" Arms Transfers to
Israel provides a comprehensive picture of the origins and development
of the U.S.-Israeli military assistance relationship]{.underline}. In
doing so, although not intentionally, [Rodman\'s study goes a long way
toward dispelling the now fashionable myth that the strategic
relationship with Israel is driven primarily by domestic U.S.
politics.]{.underline}

My friend Andrew Rubin is an amputee. He's lost his right hand, lower
arm, right foot, and lower leg. He used to be an avid runner and
cyclist. He can't do much of that anymore, although his walking is
getting much better. Soon he might be able to run with his artificial
leg. Andrew is incredibly lucky. The medical catastrophe that left his
hand and foot so terribly damaged didn't kill him. But when his limbs
never healed even after a decade, he decided to undergo the amputations.
It was his choice, and it was made much easier because he knew what lay
ahead: the most advanced artificial limbs ever imagined. The kids call
him Bionic Man now. Andrew is lucky for another reason: He doesn't live
in Gaza. According to the United Nations, 1,700 young Gazans are facing
amputation, mainly of their legs, in the next two years. [They're among
the 7,000 unarmed Palestinians in Gaza shot by Israeli snipers over the
last year. Since last spring, thousands of Palestinians in
Israeli-occupied Gaza have poured out of their teeming refugee camps and
houses every Friday to join nonviolent protests, demanding an end to the
siege that's destroying their lives, and the right to return to the
homes Israel displaced them from. Even though they were nonviolent, they
were met by Israeli snipers from the beginning. Children, journalists,
and medics were targeted too. International law prohibits using live
fire against unarmed civilians unless the police or soldiers are in
imminent danger of death]{.underline}. That's not the case in Gaza. A UN
investigation of 189 killings during the first nine months of the
protests found that Israeli forces may have committed war crimes. [More
than 220 Palestinians have been killed so far. Stunningly, more than
29,000 have been wounded]{.underline} --- including those 7,000 by live
fire. So far, 120 have had to endure amputations --- including 20
children. Anyplace else, their limbs might've been saved. But Gaza has
been under Israeli military siege for more than 10 years. Hospitals are
massively under-equipped, many of them seriously damaged by Israeli
bombing. The delicate surgery needed to save shattered bones is
virtually impossible there, and the surgeons have no access to the most
up-to-date methods. Andrew had a choice about his amputations. Gazans
don't. The UN needs \$20 million to fill the immediate health funding
gap in Gaza. Otherwise, those 1,700 young Gazans face the catastrophic
loss of arms and legs, or risk dying of infection. They'll have
virtually no access to the advanced artificial hands, legs, and feet
that my friend Andrew uses. [Unfortunately, U.S. taxpayers are funding
this madness. Every year, we send \$3.8 billion directly to the Israeli
military --- no strings attached --- and American companies make the
tear gas and other weapons that Israel deploys against demonstrators.
Washington makes sure that no Israeli officials, political or military,
are ever held accountable at the United Nations for potential war
crimes. Crueler still, the Trump administration has cut off funding for
the very UN refugee agency that staffs health clinics in Gaza, even as
it funds the Israeli military that's filling them with gunshot victims.
The protests, overwhelmingly nonviolent, continue --- and the killing
has continued too, week after week. Meanwhile, there are so many
disabled kids in Gaza now that the beleaguered territory is setting up
special sports leagues for them. Israel needs to call off its snipers,
lift the siege of Gaza, and stop violating the human and political
rights of Palestinians. And until they do, American taxpayers need to
close their checkbook.]{.underline}

The videos that have streamed out of the Gaza Strip over the last two
weeks are disturbing, digital testaments to extreme force and terror. In
one widely circulated video taken on March 30, on the first day of what
has been dubbed the "Great Return March," 19-year-old Abdul Fattah
al-Nabi can be seen running with a tire, his back turned to the Israeli
snipers who have perched on hills overlooking Gaza. Then a shot rings
out and al-Nabi falls to the ground, becoming one of 17 people killed
that day by Israeli snipers who gunned down Palestinians as they
protested Israel's blockade of the enclave and demanded their rights as
refugees. In another clip, taken on April 6, Palestinian journalist
Yasser Murtaja is seen using a video camera to film Palestinian
demonstrators as smoke from burning tires envelops the area he is in. In
the next scene, Murtaja, who was wearing a vest marked with the words
"PRESS," is being carried by colleagues while he bleeds from an Israeli
gunshot wound. He later died. As the first of these images began to
circulate, the Israeli human-rights group B'Tselem launched a media
campaign with a simple message aimed at those tasked with responding to
Gaza's ongoing protest encampment. The organization took out ads in
Israeli newspapers with the words "[Sorry commander, I cannot
shoot"---an attempt to encourage snipers to "refuse to open fire on
unarmed demonstrators," as the group put it in a statement.]{.underline}
Thus far, however, B'Tselem's campaign hasn't worked. [Israeli snipers
have continued to shoot down unarmed Palestinians protesting near the
fence that cages in Gaza, a practice human-rights groups say is **a
crime under international law**.]{.underline} And as the Great Return
protest heads into the third of its planned six weeks, rights advocates
fear more deaths and more bloodshed at the hands of the Israeli
military. Already, [some **1300** Palestinians have been shot and
wounded, and more than **30** killed]{.underline}. But there's another
strategy for stemming the bloodshed, one that does not rely on the
conscience of soldiers---and it starts in the United States.
[Palestinian-rights groups here have begun urging Congress to demand an
investigation into alleged Israeli violations of US laws governing arms
exports, and they are calling on the State Department to enforce those
laws and cut off the flow of US weapons to Israel.]{.underline} These
efforts parallel calls by the Palestinian Boycott National Committee to
implement a global arms embargo against Israel, and a call by British
opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn for a review of UK arms sales to Israel,
but they keep a tight focus on Israel's most munificent ally. The United
States gives Israel over \$3 billion in annual military aid and, under
the terms of US-Israeli agreements, 75 percent of that aid must be spent
on US-made weapons. [At the same time, laws governing the sale of
US-made weapons to foreign countries require that these countries do not
misuse this weaponry on civilians.]{.underline} [Human-rights groups say
strict enforcement of these laws would send a statement that the
US-Israel alliance is predicated on respect of Palestinian human rights.
They also believe that strict enforcement of these laws could deter
future Israeli human-rights violations.]{.underline} "[**The United
States could send a very strong message** to the Israelis about the
unacceptability of these human-rights abuses by simply making it clear
that there's no blank check when it comes to military support if they
engage in behavior like this,"]{.underline} said Yousef Munayyer,
executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights. The US
Campaign is among the chief groups calling for accountability and has
been encouraging activists to contact members of Congress and call for
"an investigation to hold Israel accountable for violating" laws that
prohibit US-manufactured arms from being used to violate human rights.
Other groups demanding an investigation include the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee as well as prominent human-rights
organizations like Amnesty International USA, whose Middle East and
North Africa advocacy director, Raed Jarrar, explained to The Nation:
"[The fact that live ammunition has been used against unarmed
Palestinian protesters might not only be in violation of **international
law**, it might also violate US law: US military aid cannot be used by
recipient forces to **violate human rights**."]{.underline} Amnesty and
the US Campaign have focused their calls around two laws in particular:
the Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits US assistance to countries
that consistently violate human rights, and the Leahy Law, a provision
of the Foreign Assistance Act that prohibits the United States from
sending arms to individual units of foreign security forces that commit
gross human-rights violations. The Leahy Law is narrower, but could
ultimately prove more effective, some advocates have suggested, since it
may be easier to cut off aid to singular units that misuse US weaponry
than to a whole army. It also helps that Leahy himself has said, in a
statement issued by his office to another publication, that he wants to
know whether his law applies to the Israeli military units who killed
protesters in Gaza. [While it is difficult without investigation to
determine what role, if any, US aid and weapons played in the recent
killings at the Gaza border, experts who monitor US assistance to Israel
told me, for a story published previously in The Intercept, that US aid
"of one type or another" is assumed to benefit virtually all Israeli
military units]{.underline}. At a minimum, images released by the Israel
Defense Forces show some of the rifles that soldiers on the Gaza border
are equipped with, and at least two seem to have a US provenance.
According to Sarit Michaeli, who tracks Israeli weapons as the
international advocacy officer for B'Tselem, one photo shows an Israeli
soldier surveying Gaza while holding a Remington M24 sniper rifle, a gun
made in the United States by the New York--based company Remington Arms.
In another photo, a soldier holds what looks like an SR-25 semiautomatic
sniper, a gun made by the Florida-based Knight's Armament Company. The
Nation asked the Israeli army about whether it was using US-manufactured
weapons like the Remington or SR-25. An army spokesperson did not
respond to those questions, and only said: "The IDF uses means such as
warnings, riot dispersal means, and, as a last resort firing live rounds
in a precise, measured manner. The IDF is committed to preventing
infiltration into Israeli territory and threats against its troops and
Israeli citizens." [In theory, a finding by the State Department that
the Israeli army extrajudicially killed Palestinians in violation of
international law---as human-rights group allege---could **lead the
United States to cut off the flow of arms** to Israel.]{.underline} The
problem is that theory and practice rarely, if ever, meet when it comes
to the application of laws governing the sale of US-made weapons. There
is too much pressure from the defense industry and other interest
groups, and too little political will, to enforce these laws---on Israel
or on any other allied country the United States supplies with weaponry,
like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both of whom also use US weapons to fire
indiscriminately on civilians. "Recipients of US weapons understand that
they're very unlikely to be held accountable for \[a use of\] US
equipment \[that results\] in civilian casualties," said Brittany
Benowitz, an expert on arms-exports laws who worked as a defense adviser
to former senator Russ Feingold. "[This is creating a perception around
the world that the US is indifferent to human suffering."]{.underline}
There have been occasional exceptions, moments when legislators and even
presidents have made moves, however small, to stanch the flow of arms to
flagrant perpetrators. President Barack Obama, for instance, temporarily
halted the flow of Hellfire missiles to Israel during the country's
deadly assault on Gaza in 2014. (No other US-made weapons were stopped,
however.) The Obama administration also criticized Israel over the
Israeli army's killing of civilians during that assault. [But such
interventions are rare, and, in the case of Israel, have grown even less
likely under President Donald Trump,]{.underline} who has fully aligned
US policy with the wishes of Israel's far-right government and promised
not to publicly air disagreements with Israel. Indeed, the Trump
administration has said nothing about Israel's use of deadly force
against unarmed civilians. Instead, Jason Greenblatt, the White House
envoy in charge of Israel/Palestine, criticized the Palestinian
protesters. As for Congress, only a handful of members have criticized
Israel's actions. The State Department did not respond to requests for
comment from The Nation on whether it was concerned about Israel firing
on unarmed civilians in Gaza, in possible violation of US law. "That
sends a message to the Israelis that the United States is fully behind
the use of lethal force on protesters. That is dangerous," said
Munayyer, the head of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights. "That the
American administration is shielding an Israeli military engaged in
those kinds of brutally repressive acts is a new low." [Still, Munayyer
told The Nation it remained important **to press the United States to
enforce its arms-export laws as they apply to Israel.** "**This is an
opportunity** for people to communicate with their representatives and
demand action on this front, because it is a question of whether or not
US law has been violated," he said. "**It's an opportunity for
accountability."**]{.underline}

Last week, I addressed a United Nations Security Council meeting on
"Israeli Settlements." [Because I knew that other speakers, experts, and
diplomats would address the illegality of Israeli settlements, the
economic and human rights impact on the Palestinian people, and the
stated design of the entire settlement enterprise to eliminate the
possibility of a viable and contiguous Palestinian state, I focused my
remarks on my government's role in enabling Israel's settlements and its
complicity in Israel's violations of international law. This may seem
like harsh language, but when nothing is done to stop an activity that
violates international law, contributes to human rights abuses, and
presents a clear danger to peace -- then I don't know any other way to
describe American actions. During the past 50 years, there has been a
steady erosion in U.S. policy toward Israeli behavior in Palestinian
lands.]{.underline} Successive American administrations' attitudes
toward Israeli settlements have gone from passive acquiescence to
outright acceptance. Even when some presidents expressed opposition to
Israeli settlements, they took no concrete action to stop them. The net
result has been that the settlement population in the occupied
territories grew from 50,000 during the Carter administration to 620,000
Israeli settlers today. [The growth of settlements and settlers has been
as steady as the erosion of the official U.S. policy on this critical
question.]{.underline} In 1976, the Ford administration was firm in its
support of the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Conventions, which
governs the behavior of an occupying power, to Palestine. President
Jimmy Carter was equally firm on this matter. He even sought a formal
legal opinion from the State Department legal advisor who determined
that settlements were, in fact, a violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention. U.S. adherence international law regarding settlements ended
with President Ronald Reagan. Reagan was neither a student of law nor
policy and when tackling complex matters in interviews, sometimes made
awkward pronouncements based on his vague recollection of policy talking
points. One particularly sloppy example occurred during his first week
in office. When asked about Israel's planned expansion of settlements,
he said "As to the West Bank, I believe the settlements there...they're
not illegal. Not under the UN resolution that leaves the West Bank open
to all people -- Arab and Israeli alike." Though sloppy, this statement
became U.S. policy. During the rest of his time in office, Reagan
meandered between contradicting Carter's position on the illegality of
settlements and saying that settlements were eroding "Arab confidence in
Israel's willingness to enter into a peace agreement." In the end,
Reagan had done real damage to U.S. policy. After him, no U.S. president
referred to settlements as illegal. Reagan's successor, George H.W. Bush
was firmly opposed to Israeli settlements, even withholding, as a
penalty, congressionally-approved loan guarantees from Israel. Still,
Bush never called settlements illegal, instead terming them "obstacles
to peace." President Clinton, who inherited the Oslo Accords, continued
a similar approach to settlements. He never claimed settlements were
illegal and instead argued that continued construction was in violation
of the "Oslo process," which prohibited the parties from undertaking
"unilateral actions" that could predetermine final negotiations. While
expressing concern with settlement expansion, the George W. Bush
administration often took positions which enabled their growth. For
example, he acceded to Israel's effort to distinguish between "legal"
settlements and "illegal" outposts, insisting that the latter be removed
(they were not), while only paying scant attention to the former (many
of which Israel proceeded to encapsulate behind a 420 mile wall --
redrawing its borders with the West Bank). And despite endorsing the
"Road Map" -- which called on Israel to dismantle all settlement
"outposts" erected after March 2001 and freeze all settlement activity
-- Bush sent a letter to Prime Minister Sharon in April 2004 which
stated that, "in light of new realities on the ground, including already
existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect"
these settlements will be removed after final status negotiations. In
short, what was once illegal became accepted as a "new reality."
President Barack Obama made repeated efforts to end settlement
expansion. In his 2009 Cairo speech, Obama said, "the United States does
not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. This
construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to
achieve peace...it is time for these settlements to stop." When
challenged by the Israelis on the need to allow "natural growth" and
their claim that the Bush administration had given them permission to
build within the "blocs" that were assumed Israel would annex -- the
Obama administration initially denied the validity of the Bush "promise"
and Secretary Clinton forcefully stated that President Obama "wants to
see a stop to settlements -- not some settlements, not outposts, not
'natural growth' exceptions...That is our position. That is what we have
communicated very clearly[." Despite this rhetoric, little changed and
eventually Obama officials also began speaking of existing settlements
as "realities" that would eventually be annexed by Israel with
Palestinians being compensated with unspecified "land
swaps."]{.underline} It was President Donald Trump who delivered the
final blow to the U.S. position on settlements. Under his leadership,
settlements are not only legal, they aren't even "obstacles to peace."
When Israel announces new construction, there's nary a peep from the
State Department. And while we haven't seen "the ultimate deal," from
what we know, most likely this administration will bless Israel's
retention of all settlements it has constructed. What's clear is that
the United States bears responsibility for Israel's continued flouting
of international law. Despite past empty protests: we have continued to
provide massive amounts of aid and loan guarantees; we have blocked all
efforts to censure Israeli behavior; and, Congress and state
legislatures are in the process of criminalizing the right of Americans
to use boycotts to oppose settlements. [There is no other way to
describe this behavior other than to say that we have become complicit
in Israel's international law violations. The international community
needs to develop a new strategy to deal with this critical
matter]{.underline}. Passing another UN General Assembly resolution that
protests Israeli policies will accomplish nothing, neither will more
speeches reaffirming the importance and applicability of international
law. The burden for changing Israeli behavior must not be left to the
weakest party -- the Palestinians -- because they are not only
confronting Israel. They are also confronting the United States, which
has given Israel the green light and the wherewithal to continue to act
with impunity. [At this point, an international strategy must be
developed to confront Israel and the backing it receives from the United
States. What is at stake is not only the human rights of a beleaguered
Palestinian nation, but the viability of international law and fabric of
civilized world order.]{.underline}

Tel Aviv - Human rights activists are stepping up efforts to expose
Israel\'s long and covert history of supplying weapons and military
training to regimes while they actively commit massacres, ethnic
cleansing and genocide.

**[The issue of Israel\'s trade with rogue regimes has been thrust into
the spotlight again after revelations that it is sending weapons to
Myanmar, in defiance of a US and European arms embargo.]{.underline}**

Formerly known as Burma, [Myanmar was condemned last month by the United
Nations for conducting what it called a \"textbook ethnic cleansing\" of
the Rohingya]{.underline}, a Muslim minority. [Hundreds of thousands of
Rohingya are reported to have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in recent
weeks, after evidence of the torching of entire villages, massacres and
systematic rapes.]{.underline}

[Israel has not divulged details of its ties to Myanmar\'s military
government, but public records show that it has sold the military there
armed patrol boats, guns and surveillance equipment. Myanmar\'s special
forces have also been trained by Israelis.]{.underline}

Human rights groups are set to stage a protest outside Israel\'s
parliament on October 30, calling for an immediate halt to the weapons
sales to Myanmar.

**[Israeli firms have also broken with the United States and Europe by
supplying weapons and surveillance equipment to militias in South
Sudan]{.underline}**, where a civil war has raged since late 2013. Some
300,000 Sudanese are believed to have been killed in the fighting.

Eitay Mack, a human rights lawyer, has submitted a spate of petitions to
the Israeli courts in an attempt to bring to light details of Israel\'s
trade with such regimes. He said the cases were designed to hasten war
crimes investigations of the officials and contractors involved.

\"[Many Western states sell arms, but what\'s unique about Israel is
that, wherever war crimes and crimes against humanity are being
committed, you find Israel is present,]{.underline}\" Mack told Al

\"The companies selling the weapons, and the officials who quietly
approve the trade, must be held accountable. Otherwise, why would this

[Representatives of Myanmar's military attended Israel's largest,
government-supported security and weapons conference in Tel
Aviv]{.underline} on Tuesday. The officials arrived at the Tel Aviv Expo
Center for the International Defense, HLS & Cyber Expo, known as ISDEF,
in full military gear. There they browsed through defense equipment and
technologies produced by Israeli and international companies, alongside
delegates of dozens more countries.

[Top Myanmar army officials traveled to Israel in September 2015 for a
"shopping spree" with Israeli weapons manufacturers.]{.underline} They
also met with President Reuven Rivlin, the IDF chief of staff, as well
as the head of the Defense Ministry's International Defense Cooperation
Directorate.

[Israel supposedly stopped selling advanced weaponry to Myanmar in 2017
following petitions filed by human rights activists]{.underline} and
attorney Eitay Mack to Israel's High Court of Justice. Based on court
hearings and statements made by Myanmar army officers, some of the arms
that Israel has supplied include rifles, gunboats, and military
training. [The court has kept its ruling secret, however, and Israel
does not allow any official publication of its arms trade with
Myanmar.]{.underline}

[According to the report produced by the UN's Fact-Finding Mission on
Myanmar, the military has committed massive violations against the
Rohingya people,]{.underline} a Muslim minority group in the country,
including gang rapes, forced disappearances, and the burning of hundreds
of villages. Hundreds of thousands more displaced Rohingya civilians
live in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. The report specifically
names six senior commanders as most responsible for the human rights
abuses, including the Tatmadaw Commander in Chief, Senior-General Min
Aung Hlaing, who previously met with the Israeli army's Chief of Staff
on a visit to Israel.

According to the United [Nations, the ongoing human rights atrocities
committed by Myanmar's military against the Rohingya people amount to
crimes against humanity and genocide. The European Union extended an
embargo on arm sales to Myanmar in April and UN officials have urged the
international community to cut off all support for the country's
military. Israel has a history of selling weapons to
dictatorships,]{.underline} among them the juntas in Argentina and
Bolivia, Rwanda in the years leading up to the genocide, among others.

Also at the expo were representatives from South Sudan, including
diplomat William Ador. Since 2013 the country has been torn by a civil
war that has left nearly 400,000 dead and forced millions from their
homes or to the brink of starvation. [The two sides signed a new peace
deal in September, although the fighting and human rights abuses
continue. **The U.S., EU, and UN Security Council have all imposed an
arms embargo on the country.**]{.underline}
