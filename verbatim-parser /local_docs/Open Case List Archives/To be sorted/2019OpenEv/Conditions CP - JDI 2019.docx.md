March 2001 \[aw\]

Given the overview and examples I have cited today, it is clear [that we
have a long, long way to go before U.S. ideals of democracy and human
rights become serious factors in our government's decisions on which
military forces to arm and train. But]{.underline} the fact that we are
having this hearing, and that the [Congress has shown bipartisan support
for the concept of conditioning U.S. arms transfers on standards of
human rights and democracy]{.underline}, suggests that this is no time
to give up hope.

[One small but important step that can and should be taken immediately
is for the State Department to abide by the spirit and letter of the
International Arms Sales Code of Conduct law by taking specific steps to
describe whether or not U.S. arms recipients covered by the human rights
report live up to the standards set out in that
legislation]{.underline}.

Apparently the department's position has been that since most of the
human rights indicators embodied in the code are discussed in the
report, they need take no additional steps. But as a person who has
spent most of my adult life working on issues related to arms transfers
and human rights, I can testify that this approach is woefully
inadequate.

[Absent information about the U.S. arms transfer and military training
relationship with a given country, AND an enumeration of the key
elements of the Code of Conduct with some discussion of whether a given
nation is meeting those standards, it is virtually impossible to
"connect the dots" to make an assessment of which nations]{.underline}
covered by the report [meet the code's human rights and democracy
criteria]{.underline}. **[What is needed to comply with the law is a
specific discussion of each country's adherence to the code criteria,
along with information on the status of U.S. arms transfer and training
programs targeted to that nation.]{.underline}** The discussion need not
be exhaustive, but it is well worth a paragraph or two of analysis for
each country. [The resulting product would be far more useful as a spur
to annual discussions about how far we have come as a nation in
harmonizing our arms export and military training decisions with our
commitments to democracy and human rights]{.underline}. Given that the
State Department has made great strides towards providing objective
assessments of the human rights records of allies and adversaries
alike[, this additional bit of analysis on adherence to the criteria set
out in the Code of Conduct would not be an onerous task involving
additional research.]{.underline} It **[would simply involve having the
experts who write up the reports draw out the comparisons between the
country's human rights performance and the standards set out in the
International Arms Sales Code of Conduct law.]{.underline}** For a
modest additional effort, [we could have an extremely useful tool for
stimulating official discussion and policy debate on the link between
U.S. arms transfers and human rights]{.underline}.

Recently, [many scholars have highlighted the ways in which domestic
institutions pacify interstate relations]{.underline}. This literature,
commonly known as the [Democratic Peace literature]{.underline}, [argues
that]{.underline} [[democracies tend not]{.mark} to
[fight]{.mark}]{.underline} (Maoz & Russett, 1993; Oneal et al., 1996;
Bueno de Mesquita et al., 1999; Russett & Oneal, 2001). As one scholar
puts it, 'the absence of war between democracies comes as close as
anything we have to an empirical law in international relations' (Levy,
1989). [[This findin]{.mark}g, [having **survived**]{.mark} [**multiple
operationalizations, empirical specifications, and econometric models**,
is now a **standard control variable**]{.mark} in the
literature.]{.underline}

How does democratic regime type operate to pacify international
relations? [One of the main mechanisms]{.underline} that [[scholars
point to]{.mark} when explaining the democratic peace focuses on the
role of **[audience costs]{.mark} in constraining leaders**]{.underline}
and helping them to signal their resolve (Fearon, 1994). Importantly,
this [audience cost mechanism relies on the assumption that there is
uncertainty over each leader's willingness to go to war]{.underline}.
Proponents of the audience cost theory suggest that [the greater ability
that a leader's relevant domestic audience has to punish leaders who
lose disputes or escalate crises, the **more one learns about the
leader's resolve**]{.underline} (Fearon, 1995). Thus, [the potential for
domestic audiences to **punish leaders** for losing disputes or
escalating crises]{.underline} [reveals information that helps states to
settle their disputes **without going to war.**]{.underline} Several
[[scholars have tested and **found evidence**]{.mark} for this audience
costs explanation (**Gelpi, 2001; Tomz, 2007**)]{.underline}.2

region are major arms purchasers, empowered by partnerships with outside

part due to external relationships, some Middle Eastern [countries have
developed and continue to develop military industrial bases that supply

POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS: AN INSTRUMENT OF LEVERAGE

[The radical concentration of the world's defense industrial sector
described above allows the United States a powerful role within the
larger international system]{.underline}. During the Cold War, US
influence was constrained by the bipolar structure of the system. Within
the Western alliance, major collaborative programs that helped European
arms industries recover from World War II were successfully completed.
The 'two-way street' policy of arms cooperation between Europe and the
US was introduced later in order to reduce duplication in defense
research and development. Its stated goals were not very different from
those of today: greater standardization and interoperability, the
improved defense posture of the NATO alliance, and savings in defense
spending. Over time, however, differences arose over the purpose and
extent of technology transfers. From the European perspective, access to
US technologies and markets was seen in terms of the economic benefits
that would accrue to Europe's national defense industries. But the
United States, focused on the Cold War, insisted upon strict technology
transfer restrictions to control the diffusion of American military
technology to its enemies90 -- policies that became a contentious issue
in US bilateral relations with its allies.

By the late 1980s, however, new opportunities emerged for the United
States to revise and reinforce its foreign policy strategies. Foreign
governments struggling with heightened economic and strategic
insecurities --even those governments once hostile to the United States
--were now more receptive and vulnerable to US initiatives. [The United
States now could wield its comparative military and industrial advantage
more freely as an instrument of persuasion. The sheer size and
sophistication of the US defense production sector provided US
policy-makers with a variety of policy options from which to choose.
Gradually, a broad and overlapping range of incentives, rewards, and
sanctions evolved that the US government now uses to encourage
cooperative behavior from other states]{.underline}.

Incentives and Rewards

Today, [the broad array of incentives and rewards the United States has
to offer for cooperation includes military credits]{.underline}, offset
arrangements, [technology transfers]{.underline}, loans, economic aid,
joint ventures, [different forms of military assistance]{.underline},
[and the removal of penalties -- whether they are arms
embargoes]{.underline}, technology transfer restrictions, onerous export
regulations, or high transaction costs. Given the potential rewards[,
access to the US defense industrial sector has become a strong incentive
for political cooperation in the current international
system]{.underline}.

As early as 1987, the idea of creating a category of 'major non-NATO
ally' (MNNA) had taken hold in US government circles. Conceived as an
incentive and reward for cooperation, [MNNA status afforded non-NATO
countries many of the collaborative and technology transfer advantages
provided to full NATO members. MNNA partners in the US-led war on
terrorism,]{.underline} for example, [receive anti-terrorism financial
assistance and the Department of State has introduced special procedures
to expedite military exports]{.underline} to US partners in Afghanistan
and Iraq. In addition, the Bush administration made it clear that the
\$87 billion in reconstruction work for Iraq would go only to those
countries with troops in Iraq.91

**[Avoiding prospective penalties also is frequently the incentive for
cooperation, moderation, or compromise.]{.underline}** [The US--EU
controversy over EU government subsidies for the Airbus-A350 is one
example]{.underline}. In May 2005, [the United States filed a suit in
the World Trade Organization, charging that risk-free EU loans to Airbus
for 'new start' aircraft violate global trade rules. The EU countersued
that Boeing receives similar loans.]{.underline} In response, the United
States maintains that Boeing's loans are commercial loans that must be
repaid and therefore fall within WTO rules. [To encourage the EU to end
these subsidies, the United States shaped a policy strategy that
included both incentives and disincentives]{.underline}. According to
Richard Aboulafia, an American aerospace analyst[, the incentive is
continued access to the US defense market at a time when European
companies increasingly 'tie their growth to U.S. revenues' (Sirak,
2005). The threat is the potential for the WTO to rule in favor of the
United States or issue findings that worsen transatlantic trade
relations]{.underline}.

Since the controversy over subsidies erupted, EADS in partnership with
Northrop Grumman won a DOD \$35 billion contract to supply and maintain
179 tanker planes over two decades. While the EU--US dispute remains
before the WTO and the USAF tanker competition has been reopened and is
still undecided, some [defense analysts predict that for EU
policy-makers, the prospect of losing future US defense revenues will,
in the long run, be the deciding factor on this issue]{.underline}.92

Threats and Sanctions

[US policy-makers also have invoked a host of embargoes, restrictions,
denials, threats, and penalties to encourage other states to comply on
various issues]{.underline}. In recent years, for example, the question
of military exports to China became a key irritant in US--Israeli and
US--European relations and a litmus test of US influence.

Israel and China

[Israel, which receives about \$3 billion annually in US foreign aid and
actively collaborates in US defense industrial projects, has followed a
strategy of close political/military alliance]{.underline} with the
United States. But Israeli--US [differences over Israel's exports to
China have periodically soured the relationship]{.underline}. In 2005,
[Israel's reported secret sales of upgrades for the Harpy radarkilling
drones to China elicited a strong response and severe
sanctions]{.underline} from the United States. [These included halting
Israeli--US collaborative programs (including the Joint Strike Fighter),
ending Israel's role in upgrades to the Joint Direct Attack Munitions
Initiative, banning Israeli contributions to the US Army's Future Combat
Systems, freezing exchanges of information on the development of an
attack drone, and stopping the sale of US night-vision equipment to
Israe]{.underline}l.93 Moreover, [US suppliers of materials and
components to Israel experienced inordinate delays in what were once
routine US State Department license approvals]{.underline}. Reportedly,
the standard review process that used to take at most two months began
dragging out to eight months or more[. The head of the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, which manages the Pentagon's foreign sales, declared
that the US government would not consider any new defense sales to
Israel until the dispute over Israel's sales to China was
resolved.]{.underline}94

**[In an effort to end the costly dispute, Israel initiated several
policy changes and agreed to others]{.underline}**. It prohibited local
firms from visiting, discussing or in any way generating new business
with China without written permission from the defense ministry. The
prohibition extends not only to defense sales but to dual-use items that
the United States might perceive as benefiting the Chinese military[.
Israel's Foreign Minister publicly apologized for having 'damaged U.S.
interests', and the Director-General of the Israeli Ministry of Defense
resigned under US pressure. Israel also agreed to restructure its
agencies regulating defense exports and, it is rumored, acceded to a US
demand to report not just exports to China but from Israel to other
countries as well.]{.underline} As one senior [Israeli defense source
observed, 'If the United States, which provides Israel with \$2 billion
in annual military aid, demands that we will not sell anything to China
-- then we won't. If the Americans decide we should not be selling arms
to other countries as well -- Israel will have no choice but to
comply]{.underline}.'95

Europe and China

[Exports to China have also disrupted US--European
relations]{.underline}. [In early 2005, the EU considered lifting its
16-year-old arms embargo on China,]{.underline} which had been imposed
in 1989 because of the Chinese government's violent suppression of the
Tiananmen Square protest. [The United States requested that the arms
embargo not be lifted and issued a series of public statements to
emphasize its request]{.underline}. In March 2005, [a Senate resolution
declared that lifting the embargo 'would potentially adversely affect
transatlantic defense cooperation, including future transfers of United
States military technology, services, and equipment to European Union
countries.]{.underline}' Some days later, [a senior US official warned,
'If the EU does lift its arms embargo against China, it is going to have
a significant negative impact on transatlantic defense
cooperation]{.underline}.'96

[The incentives for selling to China are very high for
Europe]{.underline}. It is China's ongoing military modernization
efforts and huge civilian market that beckon. According to one report,
by 2040, China's annual demand for military hardware will reach about
\$295 billion in current dollars. It estimates that the United States
will remain the largest defense market (\$101 trillion in 2040,
accounting for 36% of global demand), but China will be the fastest
growing single country in the world.97

[In spite of the great incentive to export military technology to China,
however, antagonizing the United States may be seen as too great a
risk.]{.underline} According to defense analyst Loren Thompson, [most of
the European defense and aerospace companies that do business with the
Pentagon stand to lose more than they gain]{.underline} from selling to
China. 'America is where we're looking for growth', a BAE company
spokesman said. 'If that becomes mutually exclusive with doing business
in China, then we will go with the United States.'98 [In April 2005, the
European Parliament voted 431--85, with 31 abstentions, in favor of
urging the EU not to end the embargo. By April 2006, the vote rose to
618--16 in favor of not ending the embargo]{.underline}. To date the EU
has postponed a final decision.99 Dr [Kerry Brown, a British Asia expert
commented: 'The embargo was briefly lifted \[2005\] but because of huge
pressure from the US it was then re-imposed]{.underline}. From that
moment, the Chinese saw the EU as being in the pocket of the United
States, which has significantly more hard power than the EU. That really
told China a lot about what kind of Europe it was now dealing with.'100

The Presidential Memorandum regarding US CAT policy emphasizes two
distinct economic security goals. The first goal is to expand the US
economy. The second goal is a more fine-grained emphasis on improving
economic security. 10 [General US economic performance has security
implications because the economic size and wealth of the United States
ultimately funds the defense budget that converts economic power to
military power.]{.underline} **[However, any contribution of arms
transfers to the general economic health of the United States is
separate from its detailed security effects such as stimulating
innovation in defense systems or preserving defense industrial
capability to make specific weapon systems.]{.underline}** In some ways,
this difference is akin to the difference between macroeconomics and
microeconomics. The Presidential Memorandum directs that both kinds of
effects be considered in the arms transfer approval process.

It appears that this position of [U.S. dominance in the weapons trade is
likely to continue for some time to come]{.underline}: in 1999, the
State Department granted a record \$53.7 billion in arms export
licenses.\[2\] Although not all of these licenses will result in final
sales, they are [a disturbing indicator of a pro-export attitude that
has permeated Executive Branch policymaking on arms transfers throughout
the post-Cold War period]{.underline}.

As the leading arms supplier -- and as the world's oldest, most widely
respected democracy -- **[the United States has a special obligation to
set strict standards about the kinds of governments that receive U.S.
weaponry]{.underline}**. **[If we don't do it, no other
nation]{.underline}** will. As Jimmy Carter put it in 1976, "we cannot
have it both ways. [We can't be both the world's leading champion of
peace and the world's leading supplier of arms]{.underline}."\[3\]

I have been working on the issue of U.S. arms transfers since the late
1970s, when the Carter administration's policies of promoting human
rights and arms transfer restraint were beginning to give way to
allegedly more "realistic," hardline policies. Under the guise of
strengthening longstanding allies like the Shah of Iran and winning over
former adversaries like the People's Republic of China, the Carter
administration walked away from its commitment to reduce the United
States role as the world's leading arms merchant.\[4\] More than twenty
years later, I believe more strongly than ever that when it comes to
arming human rights abusers, the self-appointed "realists" are the ones
who are living in a dream world, while the advocates of restricting arms
exports to repressive regimes are the ones who are grounded in reality.

From Iran to Indonesia, and from Central America to the Congo, [our
nation's role as the world's leading arms merchant has done far more
harm than good. Using arms sales as a way to win friends and intimidate
adversaries has not only fostered serious human rights abuses in the
recipient nations; it has also undermined U.S. interests by spreading
instability and fueling conflict]{.underline}.\[5\]

[It's time to make human rights the primary consideration in U.S. arms
sales decision-making]{.underline}, not just one factor among many. We
need to move beyond the point where, on issues of national security
concern, human rights considerations are routinely cast aside in favor
of more pressing, "pragmatic" concerns. At the dawn of a new millennium,
in the first few months of a new administration and a new Congress, it
[is time to take a serious look at the impact of U.S. arms sales on
human rights with an eye towards changing our arms sales policies for
the better]{.underline}. It is my hope that today's hearings will be an
important step in that process.

#### Human rights key To Survival Copelon 99

(Rhonda, Professor, Law, CUNY, "The Indivisible Framework of
International Human Rights," NEW YORK CITY LAW REVIEW, 1998/1999, p.
71-72.)\
The indivisible human rights framework survived the Cold War despite
U.S. machinations to truncate it in the international arena. [The
framework is there to shatter the myth of the superiority]{.underline}
**\[\*72\]** [of the U.S. version of rights, to rebuild popular
expectations, and to help develop a culture and jurisprudence of
indivisible human rights]{.underline}**.** Indeed, in the face of
systemic inequality and crushing poverty, violence by official and
private actors, globalization of the market economy, and military and
environmental depredation, the human rights framework is gaining new
force and new dimensions. It is being broadened today by the movements
of people in different parts of the world, particularly in the Southern
Hemisphere and significantly of women, who understand [the protection of
human rights as a matter of individual and collective human survival and
betterment]{.underline}**.** Also emerging is a notion of
third-generation rights, encompassing collective rights that cannot be
solved on a state-by-state basis and that call for new mechanisms of
accountability, particularly affecting Northern countries. The emerging
rights include human-centered sustainable development, environmental
protection, peace, and security. 38 **Given the poverty and inequality
in the United States as well as our role in the world,** [it is
imperative that we bring the human rights framework to bear on both
domestic and foreign policy.]{.underline}

#### Human rights abuses lead to genocide

**JBI 10**

(The Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights.
"Preventing Genocide and Mass Atrocities" June 2010,
http://www.jbi-humanrights.org/jacob-blaustein-institute/preventing-genocide-and-mass-atrocities.html)

The Jacob Blaustein Institute's Genocide Prevention Project is working
to clarify the extent of state obligations in terms of genocide
prevention. At the request of the Special Advisor on the Prevention of
Genocide, JBI has under taken an extensive legal review, including
consultations with a team of legal specialists and human rights experts,
of the many [indicators of genocide]{.underline} in order to identify
the corresponding legal norms that can be invoked to remind governments
of their obligations. The 'risk factors' [consist of a compilation of
human rights abuses]{.underline} which have been recorded in the lead up
to past genocides and their corresponding legal norms. The
[precursors]{.underline} can include a history of [mass
atrocities]{.underline} in a particular country; [targeted
violence]{.underline} against members of a particular group; the
[state-condoned use of]{.underline} dehumanizing, discriminatory [hate
speech]{.underline} against members of a particular group; employment
and education [practices that discriminate]{.underline} against specific
groups; [denial of citizenship]{.underline} to members of targeted
groups; among [other such practices.]{.underline} This list is not
exhaustive, and pre-genocidal situations will have significant
contextual differences that will require case-by-case analysis. The
international community acknowledged the importance of establishing
early warning mechanisms to effectively prevent the onset of genocide,
most recently in the World Summit Outcome Document of 2005. States must
be reminded that they have obligations to prevent genocide based on
internationally accepted norms with which they are expected to comply.
They must be provided with the information necessary to make them aware
of the precursors to genocide and of the preventive steps they must take
to halt potential genocidal acts. The importance and relevance of a
normative framework for the prevention of genocide will better equip the
Special Advisor to respond to situations that may appear pre-genocidal.
The 'risk factors' listed in the Compilation are derived from
international legal norms found in the major international and regional
human rights treaties and jurisprudence. [The risk factors]{.underline}
do not [refer to]{.underline} random acts but to [severe and systematic
abuses of human rights.]{.underline} Many of the rights associated with
the risk factors are non-derogable as set forth in Article 4 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Though
[all]{.underline} of the risk factors in the compilation [constitute
violations of human rights]{.underline} and humanitarian law, each one
in and of itself is a "necessary but not sufficient causal factor" of
genocide. However, [when one]{.underline} and/[or more risk factors
appears]{.underline} in combination with others and in certain
circumstances including deteriorating political, economic and legal
conditions in a society, [they]{.underline} may well [contribute to the
onset of genocide. The presence]{.underline} of one or more risk factors
therefore does not necessarily mean that genocide will take place, but
it should [serve as an early warning to a state]{.underline} that it
should take measures to mitigate the risk. The Compilation of Norms is
in its near-final stages of review. It will serve to clearly set out the
legal basis for genocide prevention within already existing norms of
international law, and facilitate with identifying specific situations
of possible concern.

## Saudi Arabia 

### 1NC 1: Saudi Arabia

#### Text: The United States federal government should end support for the Saudi-led coalition and condition further arms sales to Saudi Arabia on the ceasing of their offensive military operations in Yemen and aggressively pursuing a negotiated peace settlement.

in Yemen.

2/23/19 \[aw\]

With Congress finally poised to consider the merits of America's
military involvement in Yemen, the decision of its ostensible allies to
transfer American-made weapons to its enemies should be viewed as the
last straw. The Saudi-led and U.S.-backed military campaign in support
of beleaguered Yemeni president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi has failed to
materially improve the conditions on the ground and has instead
contributed to what the UN labeled the world's most dire humanitarian
crisis**[. America should end its support for the coalition and
condition further arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE on both
countries ceasing their offensive military operations in Yemen and
aggressively pursuing a negotiated peace settlement between the warring
parties.]{.underline}**

Saudi Arabia entered the Yemen conflict in March of 2015 driven by its
desire to roll-back the growing influence of the Houthis (a Zaydi Shia
rebel faction supported by the Iranians) and prevent Tehran from
establishing a foothold in Yemen. The United States, attempting to
solidify its relationship with the Saudis in preparation for its
then-pending nuclear deal with Iran, began offering intelligence
sharing, targeting assistance for munitions, and, until recently, midair
refueling for Saudi warplanes. America has also conducted its own air
strikes and special forces operations against terrorist groups operating
inside Yemen. Saudi Arabia initially labeled its intervention efforts as
"Operation Decisive Storm," betraying confidence in its ability to
quickly dispatch of anti-government forces.

Unfortunately, the Saudi coalition's entry into the conflict proved
anything but decisive. Between January 2016 and November 2018, the Armed
Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project recorded 60,223
conflict-related fatalities, a number over six times larger than the
United Nations' original estimate. The violence also sparked a
nation-wide famine. Save the Children estimates that eighty-five
thousand children have died of starvation, while the UN warns of a
nearly unfathomable fourteen million Yemenis who exist on the brink of
starvation.

The Saudi coalition, while far from the only cause of violence, has been
a leading driver of the mounting civilian casualties. The aforementioned
ACLED study found that Saudi Arabia and its allies were responsible for
4,614 civilian deaths since 2016 (over four times as many casualties as
the 1,027 attributed to the Houthis and their allies), while the Yemen
Data Project notes that a substantial number of Saudi air strikes are
directed at nonmilitary targets. The Saudi military is responsible for
egregious errors such as bombing a funeral that it mistook for a rebel
gathering, and its targeting of agricultural infrastructure and lengthy
blockade of Yemeni ports greatly contributed to the creeping famine.

Ironically, [Saudi Arabia's involvement in the conflict seems to be have
strengthened the positions of the forces it sought to
oppose]{.underline}. At an event hosted by the Center for the National
Interest last December, Daniel Byman of the Brookings Institute argued
that [while Iran offered limited support to the Houthis during the early
stages of the conflict, the ties between the two Shia forces have
deepened as a result of Saudi intervention, strengthening Iran's
position on the Arabian Peninsula]{.underline}. Furthermore, in addition
to benefiting from increased access to American-made weaponry, terror
groups like Al Qaeda have capitalized on the chaos brought about by the
near-collapse of the Yemeni state and solidified their foothold in the
war-torn country. [The longer the conflict rages and the more
American-made bombs are dropped on civilians, the easier it becomes for
groups like the Houthis and Al Qaeda to recruit new generations of
militants into their ranks. The Saudi campaign has become
self-defeating]{.underline}.

**[Ending American support for the coalition and threatening to suspend
arms sales to its leading members would force Saudi Arabia and the UAE
to end or dramatically reduce their military operations in
Yemen]{.underline}**. "[The Saudi military is heavily dependent on U.S.
weapons and support, and could not operate effectively without
them]{.underline}," according to a report from the Center for
International Policy. Additionally, [while the UAE's offensive is
largely ground-based and relies more on the daily cooperation of
mercenaries than it does the United States, America can still influence
Emirati policy due to the UAE's strong reliance on American arms
sales]{.underline}.

**[Saudi Arabia and the UAE depend broadly on American military support
to guarantee their regional security and would be far more likely to
begrudgingly comply with American demands than risk alienating their
most important ally.]{.underline}** If nothing else, [ending weapon
sales would drastically disrupt their ability to conduct military
operations in the short-term while putting at risk the supply of weapons
they need on to continue the war in the long-term]{.underline}.

Furthermore, while the United States has a vested interest in
eliminating Al Qaeda's foothold in Yemen, it can continue its solo
campaign against the terror group even while withdrawing support for the
fight against the Houthis. If nothing else, [a strong U.S. response to
the revelations of Saudi and Emirati mishandling of American arms
coupled with a threat to stop future arms sales would reduce the
likelihood that American weapons would be transferred to these militias
in the future, imperiling the survivability of these groups in the face
of America's counter-terror offensive.]{.underline}

[The United States must also demand greater Saudi and Emirati leadership
in the pursuit of peace in Yemen]{.underline}. Yemen's rival factions
made some progress in recent peace talks in Stockholm, but no long-term
peace can be attained without participation from the outside powers
responsible for turning an internal conflict into a regional proxy war.
[Any political settlement must include Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE,
and pushing the coalition to initiate this process and offer a mutual
cessation of violence could open the door for such
negotiations.]{.underline} Even if a comprehensive end to the fighting
remains unattainable now[, a real contract among these outside actors to
reduce their military involvement in Yemen, facilitate humanitarian aid
efforts, and agree in principal to accept a future power-sharing
agreement between the internal combatants would still markedly improve
the daily realities of millions in Yemen]{.underline}.

This strategy is certainly not without risk; [ending American
participation and undercutting Saudi and Emirati efforts in Yemen's
civil war could result in greater Iranian empowerment through the
success of the Houthis or could]{.underline}, as former Defense
Secretary James Mattis warned, [result in the loss of civilian life if
Saudi Arabia continues its bombing campaigns absent the support of
American intelligence or targeting assistance]{.underline}. **[However,
both of these scenarios are happening now even with America's
involvement]{.underline}**, and **[Saudi-led efforts to broker a
political settlement could only stand to improve the deteriorating
conditions on the ground.]{.underline}** American military support has
proven insufficient to prevent Iranian influence from spreading into
Yemen or spare civilians from the horrors of the conflict, and there is
no reason to suspect that continuing these failing policies will
eventually bring about a different end.

The revelation that American-made weapons are being transferred to the
very forces in Yemen that the United States actively opposes is
emblematic of the broad failings of the coalition's efforts in this war.
For far too long, America has allowed its allies to operate with
impunity at the expense of the Yemeni people and its own national
interest, and [the United States must leverage its influence over the
coalition leaders to change their behavior for the better]{.underline}.
America in no way benefits from the destruction of Yemen, the spread of
American weaponry to militants affiliated with Al Qaeda or Iran, or the
reputational damage caused by its association with this humanitarian
disaster[. America must act accordingly to reduce the violence in Yemen
and promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict, even if doing so
means standing up to its allies.]{.underline}

[Threatening support for Saudi Arabia's war machine can serve a variety
of purposes]{.underline}.

First, [such levers present a potentially significant stick and carrot
for achieving policy goals]{.underline} that are broader than the Yemen
war. As Senator Macro Rubio stated earlier this month on CNN's State of
the Union, ["Arm sales are important]{.underline}, not because of the
money, but [because it also provides leverage over their future
behavior]{.underline}....They will need our spare parts. They will need
our training. And those are things we can use to influence their
behavior."

Options 1-3 [can also help curtail Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's
misadventures, if not his leadership of the Saudi government
itself]{.underline}. Bruce [Riedel, who served as senior adviser on
South Asia and the Middle East to the last four presidents,
explained]{.underline} in a recent essay, "[Responsibility for the war
is on Mohammed bin Salman,]{.underline} who as defense minister has
driven Riyadh into this quagmire. [Shaking the arms relationship is by
far the most important way to clip his wings.]{.underline}" A former
Obama official said as well, "The message needs to be that the
relationship is being frozen unless MBS moves aside. What Yemen and the
Gulf crisis and Khashoggi affair have clarified is that MBS has allows
personal pique and vendettas to override any impulse to reform. He has
made the region an even more dangerous place, and, left to his own
devices, is very likely to drag us into regional conflict. So I would
pursue 4 and 2, with the former underscoring our message that MBS needs
to step aside, and the latter grounding their Air Force, to both add
internal pressure on MBS and to pressure the Saudis to negotiate a
resolution to Yemen."

[Options 1-3 can, indeed, serve purposes specific to the Yemen War,
including distancing the United States from support for Saudi crimes and
encouraging the Saudis and United Arab Emirates to **finally bring the
war to a close through political negotiations.**]{.underline}

In a New Yorker Radio Hour interview with David Remnick back in March,
Riedel explained, "The United States is not a direct party to the war,
but we are an enabler of the war. If the United States decided today
that it was going to cut off supplies, spare parts, munitions,
intelligence, and everything else to the Royal Saudi Airforce, it would
be grounded tomorrow."

[One former senior official suggested tying arm sales to different sets
of purposes]{.underline}, "I think [Congress should pause all FMS and
end other support to the Saudi campaign in Yemen]{.underline}.
**[Resumption of arms sales should be conditioned on Riyadh agreeing to
a fully transparent international investigation into the Khashoggi
incident, regular intelligence community assessments of Saudi efforts to
reduce civilian casualties in Yemen, and a report from the
administration outlining their strategy for addressing the humanitarian
crisis in Yemen and producing a peaceful settlement]{.underline}**."

The Trump administration seems determined to stick with the erratic
crown prince no matter what, arguing that oil and money are more
important than protecting U.S. values. But despite Trump's wishes, it's
clear that it will be much harder, if not impossible, for Saudi Arabia
to gain support for arms sales or any other kind of assistance that
requires approval from the U.S. Congress. Finally, the crown prince will
remain politically radioactive---there is little chance he could make a
high-profile trip to the United States to be feted by the likes of Oprah
and Mark Zuckerberg anytime soon. Yet **[in the long
term,]{.underline}** perhaps **[the only silver lining of this crisis is
it is forcing the United States to reassess the fundamental rationale of
the relationship with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** in a way it hasn't
since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, or, before that, the 1973
oil shock. **[A common refrain]{.underline}** in Congress **[has been
that there should be no more "business as usual]{.underline}**." So what
should the new business look like? **[It is tempting to file for a
divorce]{.underline}**, just as Trump has gone all in on a full embrace.
**[Yet that would be unwise. Instead, the United States must offer Saudi
Arabia's leaders a choice: They visibly shift to policies defined by
"three noes"---no further intervention in Yemen, no more fighting with
Qatar, and no more surprises---or face a significant downgrade of the
relationship. Trump has already decided.]{.underline}** Yet his
exclamation point-filled statement proclaiming the essentiality of the
relationship got it backward: **[The United States matters much more to
Saudi Arabia than Saudi Arabia does to the United States.]{.underline}**
The administration claims it needs Saudi Arabia in order to counter
Iran. But it is Saudi Arabia that needs the United States, not the other
way around. The United States is a global superpower that can cope with
a threat by a country halfway around the world with a GDP similar in
size to Maryland's. **[For Saudi Arabia, Iran is a country three times
its size right across the water with a long history of strategic
competition]{.underline}**. So, who needs whom more? Then there is the
economic relationship. There's no need to shelve American values and
bend to Saudi requests because of their oil reserves. They're not going
to stop selling oil if Washington drops its patronage of Riyadh. **[It's
in their interest to sell oil, and the United States is better insulated
from fluctuations in the energy markets than it has ever
been.]{.underline}** If the United States needed Saudi Arabia that
desperately, then Trump would certainly not be picking trade fights with
China and the European Union, whose impact on the U.S. economy dwarf
that of Saudi Arabia. Of course, Saudi money can be good for the U.S.
economy and helps the U.S. defense industry. But it is not uniquely
vital. One can only speculate why Trump sticks to his mistaken
assumptions---maybe it is his personal financial interests, or his
contrarian instincts, or the fact that most of his views on geopolitics
seem stuck in the 1970s and '80s, or simply because the House of Saud's
gilded, autocratic patriarchy feels very familiar to the House of Trump.
Whatever the reason, the green-light policy has proved to be a failure.
The United States has not ended up with a close partner in the Middle
East but with a rogue ally drawing America into unnecessary quagmires
and hurting its interests. The question is what to do about it. **[It
might feel good for the United States to turn its back on the Saudis,
but that won't enhance U.S. interests]{.underline}** or save lives.
**[The United States has leverage it must use, but that has to be
carefully estimated. A divorce will not cause the Saudis to walk away
from the war in Yemen]{.underline}** or make up with the Qataris. **[If
anything]{.underline}**, the end result will be **[the Saudis will be
less restrained, because they will no longer feel the need to acquiesce
to U.S. requests]{.underline}**. They will certainly feel the loss of
sophisticated American weaponry, but the Russians will step in and
supply them with less accurate weapons that will likely just kill more
in Yemen (for evidence of that, consider Syria). The United States will
no longer be complicit in problematic Saudi behavior, but that behavior
won't stop. Moreover, there is some truth to the argument that **[Saudi
cooperation on counterterrorism, countering Iran, managing oil prices,
and investing in the U.S. economy are important benefits,]{.underline}**
even if they do not matter as much as Trump thinks they do. Instead,
**[the United States has to offer the "three noes" deal]{.underline}**.
It starts with no surprises. The message should be clear: Washington
welcomes the fact that Saudi Arabia is willing to take on more
responsibility for its own security, but it needs to be consulted on big
strategic initiatives, especially those that implicate U.S. interests.
This would mean that, going forward, **[the]{.underline}** rash
**[decision-making of the past two years that has been so harmful to
both Saudi and U.S. interests would stop]{.underline}**.

ADJUSTING U.S. SALES

With U.S.-provided bombs used in many of the war's deadliest civilian
fatality incidents, [Congress has ample rationale to]{.underline} block,
delay, or [condition future arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
Depending on the results of this week's election, the Senate's
cross-party, forty-seven-seat opposition to such sales could become a
majority. Saudi intransigence on the Khashoggi case or Yemen peace talks
could also flip more senators into supporting a joint resolution against
new weapons packages. In [all likelihood, the president would veto any
such resolution unless Congress can show that it has carefully weighed
the costs---in terms of both neglecting the legitimate security needs of
a long-term partner and harming America's status as a security ally and
arms vendor.]{.underline}

To address these concerns, [the U.S. government should apply some
common-sense guidelines]{.underline}:

Think ahead and review the details of arms sales. Under the Obama
administration's watch, Saudi Arabia gained far greater military
capabilities and was empowered to act in pursuit of its own security.
The lack of a detailed, forward-looking, top-to-bottom review of U.S.
arms sales to Riyadh concealed this reality. Prior to considering new
sales, then, [Congress should insist that the State Department and
Pentagon provide an in-depth, holistic assessment of the kingdom's
military capabilities, security sector organization, future plans,
related purchase needs, and alternative suppliers, outlining the
implications that these findings hold for U.S. security]{.underline}.
Arms sales should be driven by a clear-eyed, long-term assessment of
U.S. strategic interests, not by simple economic opportunism or the
self-defined priorities of Saudi leaders.

Do not deny systems that are mostly defensive in nature. Some Saudi
capabilities represent welcome burden-sharing with U.S. forces in
defending the Persian Gulf region and containing Iran. Washington's
desire to hold Saudi leaders accountable for problematic actions is
understandable, but it should not be used to craft policies that reward
Tehran. The United States has a strong strategic interest in continuing
to provide naval systems, missile defenses (including THAAD), and
support for border defense and force protection (e.g., counter-mine and
counter-indirect fire systems). These systems represent 54 percent (or
\$26.5 billion) of the \$48.81 billion in Saudi arms sales proposed by
the Trump administration to date, and a sizable prize for the U.S.
economy.

[Condition and slow the provision of mostly offensive
system]{.underline}s. As described above, the kingdom could use certain
systems to take the war deeper into Yemen, including M1A2S tanks,
self-propelled artillery, and PGMs. [Delaying or conditioning their
delivery is therefore justifiable, perhaps with a proviso that they not
be deployed in Yemen unless the Houthis prove unwilling to engage in
peace talks. Washington could also tie sales to a halt in high-risk
urban strikes]{.underline}, as Secretary Pompeo suggested on October 30.

#### Condition Saudi Arabia arms sales on ending fighting in Qatar and continued cooperation

**Chollet and Goldenberg 18**

Part of **[this deal must also include Saudi shifts on two issues: no
more fighting with Qatar and no escalation of the war in
Yemen]{.underline}**. On Qatar, **[the Saudis should be pressed to walk
back the unrealistic "13 demands" they]{.underline}**, the United Arab
Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain **[have put to Qatar]{.underline}** to a
much more manageable set of requests. This is what the United States has
tried to do in its mediation efforts over the past year, but now **[it
must be made absolutely clear to the Saudis that the United States
expects more from them]{.underline}** if the relationship is to remain
unaffected**[. On Yemen, Washington should demand Saudi leaders urgently
work toward a political solution]{.underline}**. This seemed to be where
Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
were heading before Trump pulled the rug out from under them. Now that
the U.S. Senate has voted to take a step closer to cut off support for
the Saudi campaign---something the Democratic-controlled House will take
up next year---**[the administration must]{.underline}** use this to
**[press Riyadh to agree to an immediate cease-fire]{.underline}** and
ensuring humanitarian access to the port of Hodeidah, through which most
of Yemen's imports flow. **[This could come with a carrot: The Saudis
should review with the U.S. Defense Department in detail their battle
plans, doctrine, and strategy, allowing American military officers to
have a seat at the table with them and taking advice on fundamentally
shifting the approach to one more in line with U.S. values. This would
also make the Saudi fight more effective. In exchange]{.underline}** for
a willingness by the Saudis to shift their approach, **[the United
States would commit to maintaining military support]{.underline}**.
Here's where leverage comes in. **[The United States must also make
clear what happens if Saudi Arabia does not accept this
offer]{.underline}**. This is not simply about arms sales, which the
Saudis care about but not enough to change their behavior, and the U.S.
defense industry can live without (although it would understandably
prefer not to make this choice**[). If Saudi Arabia is going to
be]{.underline}** an erratic, **[unpredictable]{.underline}** partner,
**[the United States doesn't want to be]{.underline}** as closely
**[tied to them. This would mean]{.underline}** scaling back goals
regarding Saudi Arabia. It would mean **[less military
cooperation]{.underline}** and more modest economic relations. It would
mean fewer higher-level visits to kowtow to them. It would also mean
less strategic ambition. For years the United States has worked to
promote stronger regional cooperation with Riyadh at the center---it was
a worthy goal, and both of us were part of these efforts during the
Obama administration. Yet without a change in behavior, this has to be
set aside while continuing to invest in partners like the UAE, Qatar,
and Israel. In this sense, the U.S. approach toward Saudi Arabia would
be akin to the relationships with Egypt, Pakistan, and even
Turkey---important security relationships, but deeply troubled ones.
Trump is unlikely to take this opportunity. But what members of Congress
of both parties---and 2020 presidential aspirants---must do is make
clear that Trump's green-light policy will not be around forever, and
paint a picture of what the new "business as usual" will be. **[It
should be the Saudis]{.underline}**, not Americans,
**[who]{.underline}** will have to **[choose]{.underline}**. The choice
is simple: Work with the United States in genuine responsible
partnership, and together, American and Saudi interests can prosper. Or
continue their current approach---in which case, the United States will
be fine without them.

#### Arms sales are key leverage -- potential for suspension incentivizes behavior changes

**Riedel 18**

Bruce Riedel (Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for 21st Century
Security and Intelligence, Center for Middle East Policy Director - The
Intelligence Project) Brookings: After Khashoggi, US arms sales to the
Saudis are essential leverage
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/10/after-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-to-the-saudis-are-essential-leverage/>
10/10/18 \[aw\]

Eighteen months ago, Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and said he had
concluded \$110 billion dollars in arms sales with the kingdom. It was
fake news then and it's still fake news today. The Saudis have not
concluded a single major arms deal with Washington on Trump's watch.
Nonetheless, [the U.S. arms relationship with the kingdom is the most
important leverage Washington has]{.underline} as it contemplates
reacting to the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

FOLLOW THE MONEY

In June 2017, after the president's visit to Riyadh---his first official
foreign travel---we published a Brookings blog post detailing that his
claims to have sold \$110 billion in weapons were spurious. Other media
outlets subsequently came to the same conclusion. When Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammad bin Salman visited the White House this year, the
president indirectly confirmed that non-deal by chiding the prince for
spending only "peanuts" on arms from America.

[The Saudis have continued to buy spare parts, munitions, and technical
support for the enormous amount of American equipment they have bought
from previous administrations. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) is
entirely dependent on American and British support for its air
fleet]{.underline} of F15 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and Tornado
aircraft. [If either Washington or London halts the flow of logistics,
the RSAF will be grounded]{.underline}. [The Saudi army and the Saudi
Arabian National Guard are similarly dependent on
foreigners]{.underline} (the Saudi Arabian National Guard is heavily
dependent on Canada). The same is also true for the Saudis allies like
Bahrain.

Under President Obama, Saudi Arabia spent well over \$110 billion in
U.S. weapons, including for aircraft, helicopters, and air defense
missiles. These deals were the largest in American history. Saudi
commentators routinely decried Obama for failing to protect Saudi
interests, but the kingdom loved his arms deals.

But [the kingdom has not bought any new arms platform during the Trump
administration]{.underline}. Only one has even been seriously discussed:
A \$15 billion deal for THAAD, terminal high altitude area defense
missiles, has gotten the most attention and preliminary approval from
Congress, but the Saudis let pass a September deadline for the deal with
Lockheed Martin[. The Saudis certainly need more air defenses with the
pro-Iran Zaydi Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen firing ballistic missiles
at Saudi cities.]{.underline}

[The three and a half year-old Saudi war in Yemen is hugely expensive.
There are no public figures from the Saudi government about the war's
costs, but a conservative estimate would be at least \$50 billion per
year. Maintenance costs for aircraft and warships go up dramatically
when they are constantly in combat operations]{.underline}. The Royal
Saudi Navy has been blockading Yemen for over 40 months. The RSAF has
conducted thousands of air strikes. The war is draining the kingdom's
coffers. And [responsibility for the war is on Mohammed bin Salman, who
as defense minister has driven Riyadh into this quagmire. Shaking the
arms relationship is by far the most important way to clip his
wings]{.underline}.

AVENGING KHASHOGGI

[Congress now has the power to make a serious decision, halting arms
sales and the logistics train]{.underline} for the kingdom in the wake
of the reported murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi
Consulate in Istanbul Turkey last week. The outrageous attack on Jamal
deserves serious reaction, and given Trump's dereliction of duty on the
matter, it is up to Congress to act. [The president may try to override
a Senate arms stand-down but it would be a painful setback for the
prince.]{.underline}

Jamal's last opinion piece before his death was about the war in Yemen.
He called for an immediate Saudi ceasefire and blamed the war on
Mohammed bin Salman. At stake, Jamal argued, is Saudi "dignity" and its
role as a leader in the Islamic world. It has rightly been seen as an
ineffectual bully. Saudi Arabia's war is alienating people around the
world. Across the Muslim world, the Saudi brand has been damaged.
Khashoggi compared Mohammed bin Salman to Syrian President Bashar Assad
as a war criminal. His death only further darkens Mohammed bin Salman's
standing. Much of the world is likely to treat him and his henchmen as
pariahs.

The prince's goal in Istanbul was to intimidate any opposition or
criticism no matter how peaceful. The more blatant and gruesome the
intimidation, the more likely it will chill dissent. But it will also
polarize the country and encourage the deep conspiracies that could
violently and suddenly change the kingdom in very unexpected ways. These
are very dangerous waters for the House of Saud.

**[Because arms transfers (and denials) are powerful signals, they can

[mounted](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/03/24/sale-66-fighter-jets-approved-taiwan-delivery-scheduled-2021.html)
that Trump had given "tacit approval" to a deal for F-16
jets]{.underline}**, China's [protests
increased](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/04/01/taiwan-just-became-a-huge-variable-in-china-trade-war/#5c8e12e59480).
The United States has not sold advanced fighter jets to Taiwan since
1992, partially out of fear of angering China, which views Taiwan as a
renegade province. Even if the deal for F-16s is formally approved,
Taiwan is unlikely to see the jets [until at least
2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/trump-aides-said-to-back-selling-f-16-fighter-planes-to-taiwan),
and the balance of power between China and Taiwan would not change. As
one researcher

the sale would be a "huge shock" for Beijing, "But it would be more of a
political shock than a military shock. It would be, 'Oh, the U.S.
doesn't care how we feel.' It would be more of a symbolic or emotional
issue." Yet **[China's immediate, negative reaction to even the
announcement of a potential deal shows how powerful arms transfer
signals can be]{.underline}**. If this same logic is applied to an arms
embargo against Saudi Arabia, **[an arms embargo would signal that Saudi
Arabia does not have the support of the United States. This signal
would]{.underline}** be an important first step in changing **[Saudi
behavior because it would override other statements and actions the
United States has sent that indicate support]{.underline}**. And Trump

Saudis
<https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/arms-deals-give-america-leverage-not-the-saudis/>
10/18/18 \[aw\]

[Of all the talking points]{.underline} justifying American inaction in
response to the indescribably brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi[, perhaps
the worst is the idea that the Saudis somehow have leverage over America
because of their large-scale arms deals.]{.underline}

[The truth is exactly the reverse]{.underline}.

[The Saudi military is highly dependent on advanced American
weaponry.]{.underline} American F-15s comprise close to half the Saudi
fighter force, and the Saudi variant of the F-15E Strike Eagle
represents a substantial portion of the air force's striking power. On
land, the Saudi army is dependent almost exclusively on American M1
Abrams tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. [They can't just
waltz over to a different country and transform their armed forces ---
not without suffering enormous setbacks in readiness and effectiveness
during a years-long transition. A fundamental reality of arms deals is
that a major arms purchase essentially locks the purchasing nation in a
dependent posture for training, spare parts, and technical
upgrades.]{.underline}

Indeed, one of the reasons for engaging in an arms transaction --- aside
from the economic benefit --- is that [the transaction gives America
enormous power over the national defense of the purchasing nation. You
buy our weapons, and we gain power over you. Well, we gain potential
power. The question is whether we have the will to exercise
that]{.underline} power.

Moreover[, Trump's claim that the Saudis could simply go to China or
Russia betrays an odd ignorance about Chinese and Russian arms. Many of
their most advanced weapons aren't quite ready for prime
time]{.underline}. If the Saudis are terrified of Iran, purchasing worse
weapons that would require new training cycles, new spare parts, and new
technical relationships is a terrible option. It's a recipe for a
serious military setback.

For example --- as Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin observes --- the
State Department just approved the sale of Terminal High Altitude Air
Defense missile-defense system to the Saudis. The Saudis are rightfully
concerned about Iranian missile attack. Is it the position of the Trump
administration that the Saudis have leverage over us if they cancel that
deal and seek an inferior missile-defense system from a competing
country? As Rogin says, Trump's thinking is "totally and completely
backwards."

Buying a weapons platform is not like choosing between a Honda Accord
and a Toyota Camry --- where if one dealer ticks you off, you can just
walk across the street and immediately get a substantially similar
product. Trump is displaying his ignorance here, and his surrogates on
television (many of whom know better) are exploiting understandable
civic ignorance to push the administration's line. We can't expect
Americans to know exactly how arms deals work or how F-15s are serviced
and upgraded. But we should expect the president to understand these
realities.

For all the president's bluster, he's demonstrating a surprising
timidity in the face of an undeniable provocation from one of our more
mendacious "allies." [We hold the cards in this alliance, and it's time
--- for once --- to stand up to a repressive and brutal
regime]{.underline}, even if we do have a common Iranian foe. The
world's strongest nation, with the world's largest economy, needs Saudi
Arabia far less than they need us. [End support for the brutal Saudi
bombing campaign in Yemen]{.underline}. **[Impose conditions on
continued American military cooperation with Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**. It's time for the junior partner in this alliance
to finally learn its place.

### Solvency: Yemen

#### Congress can and should condition arms sales on Saudi cooperation -- solves human rights and Yemen

\[aw\]

[Congress is vital]{.underline} here. [The legislative branch has been
slow to try and rein in the excesses of the Trump administration's
foreign policy. Congress has the tools and authority capable of
correcting the U.S. approach toward Riyadh]{.underline}. Much of the
legislative debate thus far has been focused on the war in Yemen, which
has had horrific humanitarian consequences. However[, framing the
challenge solely as a war powers issue is not the right approach. No
matter how bad the Saudi strategy in Yemen is, Iranian expansionism in
the country through Tehran's proxies, the Houthis, is a threat to
America's interests]{.underline}. We cannot wash our hands of Yemen and
assume that disengagement will result in a better outcome.

[Instead, members of Congress concerned about the Trump
administration\'s approach to Riyadh should tackle the fundamental
underpinnings of its strategy. Human rights do matter to U.S. national
security]{.underline}. If the Saudi crown prince wants to reform the
kingdom, we should demand he does so honestly, not superficially, and
with verifiable results. [Human rights need to be at the center of U.S.
engagement with Riyadh just as administration officials claim it is at
the center of our concerns with the Iranian regime.]{.underline}

[Sanctions should be extended]{.underline} well beyond those involved in
the Khashoggi murder [to include those involved in the ongoing detention
and torture of political dissidents and prisoners like Samar and Raif
Badawi. U.S. officials should downgrade contacts with their counterparts
until these activists are released]{.underline}, just as the
administration did to successfully secure the release of detained
American pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey.

[U.S. military assistance should also come with conditions, based on
Saudi behavior]{.underline}. Trump likes to question the utility of
American foreign assistance and talk about countries having to earn that
assistance. Why should America's Arab partners be treated any
differently? Members of Congress often instinctively attempt
all-or-nothing solutions, attempting to end all U.S. assistance or
deciding they don't have any leverage, so why bother trying?
[Congressional foreign-policy power is most persuasive when it boxes in
the executive branch by setting commonsense boundaries for U.S.
policy.]{.underline}

[The essential tool to do that is through funding. Congress can pass
legislation placing conditions on future arms sales and other military
assistance. It should state what the United States expects from the
Saudi contributions to the partnership and what actions it considers
inconsistent with a cooperative relationship. If the president or his
successors are unable to certify these requirements are being met, U.S.
assistance would be halted]{.underline}. [Such a move would likely
garner significant bipartisan support]{.underline}.

Finally, the United States should be careful about emboldening a
reckless Saudi crown prince who has shown a blatant disregard for
international norms. One key Saudi ask is for U.S. nuclear technology
for a supposedly civilian nuclear program. Discussions regarding
granting the kingdom such technology should halt unless Riyadh shows the
grown-ups are once again in charge.

[Key to this approach is a reassertion of leverage in the U.S.-Saudi
relationship.]{.underline} The administration has overstated the
economic benefits of the partnership for the United States. Just as the
Trump administration has shrewdly played hardball with other U.S.
partners, [it should demand more of the Saudis and other Gulf partners
and not give away the store for nothing in return]{.underline}. The
Saudis, Egyptians, and others always threaten to look elsewhere for
strategic support. Such threats became a frequent refrain from Egyptian
defense officials to those in Congress trying to reform the
U.S.-Egyptian security partnership. [For all the high-profile trips to
Moscow, few end in significant deals. Buying American maintains an
allure that Moscow or China cannot compete against.]{.underline}

[Another critical component of that leverage is willingness to put boots
on the ground rather than just money. Trump has highlighted the need to
hold U.S. allies more accountable for what they contribute to the
alliance]{.underline}. Why are America's Gulf allies exempt from this
demand? More than one thousand soldiers from America's NATO allies have
died fighting America's war in Afghanistan. How many Saudis, Egyptians,
or Emiratis have been killed fighting side by side with American forces
since the attacks of 9/11? Why should the Saudis be treated any
differently than the Germans or the French at this point? Why should
American taxpayers continue to have to pay the strategic bill for Saudi
incompetence and recklessness?

[Such an approach does not commit the United States to endless war in
the Middle East. Instead, it offers some hard-headed realism about what
is required to protect U.S. interests]{.underline} in a region where
America has sacrificed thousands of lives and trillions of dollars over
the last 17 years. [We must demand more of Riyadh, both in its domestic
and foreign policy. The fate of Samar Badawi and other Saudi activists
like her must be central to U.S. policy toward the kingdom]{.underline}
going forward. [It would put the relationship in a stronger position in
the coming decades and help avoid the blowback the United States is now
facing because of its unconditional support for a crown
prince]{.underline} who has gone from being the face of modernity to one
of medievalism and, in the process, empowering America's enemies.

Lobelog: It's Time To Stop Arms Sales To Saudi Arabia
<https://lobelog.com/its-time-to-stop-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/>
5/15/19 \[aw\]

[The Senate's failure to override President Trump's veto of its effort
to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is not the
end of the story. A way can and must be found to stop U.S. assistance in
refueling, targeting, and other activities that bolster the Saudi/United
Arab Emirats (UAE) war effort]{.underline}, which has killed tens of
thousands of civilians and left millions of Yemenis at risk of famine
and fatal, war-induced diseases.

For starters, [Congress should work to close off the other main avenue
of U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition---the sale of bombs, combat
aircraft, armored vehicles, attack helicopters, and other equipment to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the two primary perpetrators of the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen. A]{.underline}ccording to statistics from
the Security Assistance Monitor, the United States has offered over \$68
billion in weaponry to those two nations since the start of the current
Yemen conflict in March 2015. As Bruce Riedel of the Brookings
Institution has noted, [these U.S.-supplied systems are the backbone of
the Saudi military, and without those weapons and related maintenance
and support they could not sustain their intervention in
Yemen]{.underline}.

[The Trump administration, the U.S. arms industry, and the Saudi and UAE
lobbies have made numerous arguments in favor of keeping U.S. weapons
flowing to its Gulf allies, but none of them holds up]{.underline} to
scrutiny.

With respect to the sales of precision-guided bombs---whose use has been
documented in the widespread killings of civilians---the argument of
choice has been that even more civilians would die in Saudi/UAE air
strikes if the coalition were limited to "dumb" bombs that could not be
targeted as accurately. This assertion is premised on the idea that
Saudi Arabia and the UAE are making good faith efforts to avoid hitting
civilians. The sheer volume of strikes on targets like hospitals, a
school bus, funerals, factories, water treatment plants, and other
civilian infrastructure puts the lie to this argument. Air strikes on
civilians are not "mistakes." They are part and parcel of the Saudi/UAE
strategy to bomb Yemenis into submission and end the war on terms
favorable to their coalition.

Another popular argument for continuing arms sales to Saudi Arabia and
the UAE is "if we don't do it, somebody else will." But the United
States and its European allies supply the Saudi air force and the
majority of the arsenals of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Saudi and
UAE militaries could not turn on a dime and seek Russian or Chinese
systems to substitute for any cutoff of U.S. weaponry and support. It
would take a decade or more for these nations to end their dependence on
U.S. arms. A few deals with Moscow or Beijing would have limited impact
on Saudi and UAE military capabilities, if Russia and China were even
willing to supply arms to two nations that are responsible for the
world's worst humanitarian catastrophe, with the international
opprobrium that would accompany any decision to do so.

President Trump's favorite argument for keeping the weapons trade going
is jobs, jobs, jobs. His claims of U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms sales
and related deals have fluctuated widely, from 40,000 to as many as one
million. But an analysis of actual deals concluded over the past two
years suggests a figure that is a fraction of the president's claims.
And many of these jobs will be created in Saudi Arabia as part of that
nation's goal of having 50 percent of the value of its arms purchases
produced in the kingdom by 2030.

Last but not least is the claim that stopping arms sales to the
Saudi/UAE coalition will aid Iran. But the Houthi-led opposition is by
no means a proxy for Tehran. They have longstanding grievances that have
nothing to do with Iran's limited military support and would be fighting
no matter what posture Iran takes towards the conflict. If anything, the
brutal Saudi/UAE intervention is driving the Houthi coalition closer to
Tehran. The best way to undercut Iranian influence in Yemen is to
support UN efforts to end the war.

[There are several congressional initiatives to cut off U.S. arms to the
Saudi/UAE coalition]{.underline}, including a bipartisan bill
co-sponsored by Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Todd Young (R-IN),
Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jack
Reed (D-RI), and Chris Murphy (D-CT). That measure would, among other
things, [stop sales of precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE for two years and condition other sales of offensive weapons on an
end to the targeting of civilians and assurances that Saudi Arabia and
the UAE will support the free passage of humanitarian ai]{.underline}d.
And a bill sponsored by Rep Jim McGovern (D-MA) would immediately end
all U.S. arms sales and military aid to Saudi Arabia[. It's time for
Congress to move on this and other initiatives that would once and for
all end U.S. support for the slaughter in Yemen.]{.underline}

The Saudis, however, are dependent on expensive U.S. weapons platforms,
and it will be difficult for them to begin buying weapons from Russia or
China. Their weapons systems and aircraft squadrons are all American,
and require almost constant American repairs. As a hardball tactic,
**[Congress could]{.underline}** try to **[pass laws that would

of three holiest mosques in the Islamic faith have made them important

great financiers of American foreign-policy adventurism, like funding
the mujahideen in Afghanistan in the '80s. The role of Saudi windfall
oil profits and petrodollar "recycling," which was so important to both
U.S. banks and Third World oil-consuming countries in the 1980s and
1990s, is also long past. **[The human-rights agenda,]{.underline}** so
often **[touted as part of U.S. policy, has never held Saudi to much of

support for the 2011 Arab uprisings frightened the sclerotic Saudi
leadership. Washington had sold out Mubarak, its partner of 30 years.

Despite the powerful symbolism of China and Russia standing by MBS in
hard times, [there are limits as to how far Riyadh will be able or
willing to pivot eastward.]{.underline} [Rather than a total strategic
reorientation, overtures eastward will focus on common economic and
political interests]{.underline} in the changing Middle East, [while
pointedly warning Washington against punishing the kingdom
further]{.underline}.

**[Saudi reliance on the US is most profound in the area of security,
and US bases in the region remain vital for Riyadh's
defence.]{.underline}** The Saudi military's lacklustre performance in
Yemen and **[the regularity that Yemen's Houthi rebels fire missiles
towards Riyadh highlight the kingdom's security deficits.]{.underline}**

[Russia and China are unlikely to take over the mantle anytime soon.
Both countries retain close military ties with arch-rival Iran, making
them awkward security partners for Riyadh]{.underline}. This is
especially true for Russia, which has cooperated extensively with Tehran
in Syria. China has no desire to take on the region's complex security
and political challenges and is much more comfortable remaining
relatively neutral. Indeed, China's key aims in the region --- securing
a reliable supply of oil and getting countries onboard its global
infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) --- seem to
demand neutrality.

In the realm of arms, [it will also be difficult for Riyadh to replace
its Western suppliers. Long-term reliance on Western weapons exports
means that any new Chinese and Russian purchases will not easily
integrate]{.underline} with pre-existing systems.

[The Trump administration is unlikely to end its support for Saudi
regional efforts or radically change its approach. But it could consider
using its influence to encourage the Saudi leadership to moderate its
assertive and damaging policies]{.underline} abroad. [Rather than
providing its assistance freely to Saudi Arabia, Washington could
utilize it to extract concessions from the Saudi leadership to alter its
behavior]{.underline}. [Making U.S. support conditional to initiatives
tied to Prince Mohammed\'s success provides Washington with a degree of
sway over the brash monarch]{.underline}, who increasingly needs to
produce a "win" in light of the reputational harm the Khashoggi affair
has done to the kingdom, his legacy and perhaps even his hold on power.

[This approach is not without risk---the Saudi government could, for
example, reduce intelligence sharing, or switch off the proverbial oil
tap]{.underline}, like the OPEC states did in 1973. But 2018 is not
1973, and [the United States is no longer as reliant on Saudi
oil.]{.underline} More so, the Saudi government\'s assertive actions
also pose operational and reputational risks to important U.S.
interests, as the Khashoggi affair demonstrated, and [therefore the
benefits of this approach are likely to outweigh any costs Riyadh may
seek to impose.]{.underline}

[On the surface, making U.S. support provisory may appear to be an
unpalatable approach, one that legitimizes the crown prince. But wielded
correctly, the White House can use this leverage to recalibrate the
U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline}. [Blanket support need not be
granted in a way that emboldens Saudi behavior]{.underline}, leading to
actions that are damaging to U.S. interests. [Instead, the
administration could consider also making conditional its support for
the Saudi government\'s priority programs with the goal of altering and
shaping its behavior. This includes making the Saudis take
responsibility for Khashoggi\'s brutal death, putting an end to
indiscriminate targeting practices in Yemen, altering the government\'s
harsh response to opposition inside and outside of the Kingdom, and
ending the rift with Qatar]{.underline}.

Naysayers of such an approach might claim that it only deepens the
transactionalism on which the U.S.-Saudi relationship is presently
based. But it is worth recognizing that the partnership was founded on
an explicit alignment of interests, not values. By acknowledging this,
the United States would be better positioned to adopt an approach that
best serves its own interests. [At this point, the Saudi government
needs U.S. support more than the White House needs Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}.

<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/05/the-united-states-should-use-its-leverage-over-saudi-arabia/>
11/5/18 \[aw\]

The global response to the journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing, which
has Riyadh on the defensive in the face of international outcry, has
opened [a window of opportunity to exert leverage over Saudi
policy]{.underline}. Last week, [the United States began pressuring the
kingdom over its role in the war in Yemen.]{.underline}

[Washington should use this moment to exert pressure on Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman to extend his economic reform agenda to the Saudi
domestic political and civil rights sphere]{.underline} as well.

Khashoggi's slaying inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month
has garnered two types of responses from U.S. officials and much of the
media: up-to-the-minute comments on the investigation and the Saudi
response or the contextualization (read: minimization) of his killing
within the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The former
approach falls short of addressing the kingdom's broader crackdown on
journalists and activists, which Khashoggi wrote about and for which he
wound up giving his life. The latter fails to recognize that the
silencing of dissent undermines Saudi Arabia's economy, stability,
reputational goals, and the human rights of its citizens. U.S. President
Donald Trump's comments after Khashoggi's death about the importance of
the U.S.-Saudi economic and security partnership reflect his disregard
or ignorance of the linkage between the political climate and Mohammed
bin Salman's economic goals.

Take, for example, how business leaders responded to the Khashoggi's
murder. Forty of the 150 or so participants scheduled to attend the
kingdom's Future Investment Initiative business conference---the
so-called Davos in the Desert---in late October pulled out over the
Khashoggi case. While international businesses will never completely
shun Saudi Arabia's economic offerings, they are responsive to certain
high-profile human rights abuses at the hands of the Saudi regime. A
similar decision was taken by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which
announced its decision to end its \$5 million project with the crown
prince's personal charity because of Khashoggi's death. This response
will only grow, following the public nature of Khashoggi's death and
Saudi Arabia's mishandling of the investigation.

[Saudi Arabia's silencing of those who want to bring reform and change
to the country also undermines the country's security and
stability]{.underline}. Khashoggi wrote that Saudis "suffer from
poverty, mismanagement and poor education" and argued that the creation
of an independent international forum "isolated from the influence of
nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary
people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural
problems their societies face." [Left unaddressed, these problems will
lead to widespread unrest, as seen throughout the region.]{.underline}
An illiberal approach to governance while seeking economic growth and
openness is a recipe for disaster.

Whatever remains of Saudi Arabia's reputation as a modernizing and
reformist country is at risk as crackdowns and arrests continue.
Khashoggi captured this concern in a piece he wrote a year ago,
highlighting the arrests of 72 intellectuals and asking whether Saudi
Arabia can "really present a compelling image of a modern society,
complete with robots, foreigners and tourists when Saudis ... are
silenced." The gap between the country's projected image and the reality
of its political climate will continue to grow over time and ultimately
undermine whatever reforms Mohammed bin Salman envisions.

Khashoggi's killing and the jailings he wrote about were not isolated
events. The prominent Saudi journalist Marwan al-Mureisi was arrested in
June while visiting his 5-year-old son in the hospital and has not been
heard from since. The respected Saudi columnist Saleh al-Shehi was
sentenced to five years in prison by a special criminalized court for
insulting the royal court. Last year, the Committee to Protect
Journalists highlighted Saudi Arabia among countries of significant
concern. (Turkey, Egypt, and China topped the list.) Mohammed bin Salman
has also cracked down on political rivals, including a purge of hundreds
of businessmen in 2017 at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, which he
attributed to anti-corruption efforts. Freedom House consistently ranks
Saudi Arabia among the "not free" countries, joining only 12 other
nations and entities in earning the lowest overall rankings for both
political and civil rights. It earned the lowest score (0 out of 4) in
freedom of the media, religion, and assembly.

[Trump; his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner; and U.S.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have established strong and trusting
relations with the crown prince and are well positioned to articulate
both a commitment to the U.S.-Saudi relationship and the importance of
reform and to make the case that the country's stability and reform
goals are not mutually exclusive with political change]{.underline}. [A
wide array of reforms are needed]{.underline}, including but not limited
to [more freedom of expression, the release of political prisoners,
termination of state control of all media outlets, an end to prosecution
of journalists who speak out against the royal family, a repeal of the
male guardianship laws, and citizen engagement in independent
association]{.underline}s. The United States can no longer praise
Mohammed bin Salman as a reformer---he is actively pursuing a
nonreformist agenda on political rights and free expression.

It goes without saying that [Trump would not pursue this conversation
based on a human rights argument.]{.underline} Human rights have not
been a priority for his administration. [But he is a pragmatist who
wants to protect U.S. security and economic interests and has shown his
support for Saudi Arabia. Here is a clear case in which human rights
protections and the expansion of freedom of expression can support U.S.
security and economic interests.]{.underline}

Likewise, [the crown prince will need to see why political reforms are
tied to the issues he genuinely cares about. Given his desire to build
his reputation as a regional and global leader pursuing significant
economic innovation and reform, he should be concerned that the grim
political rights situation is undermining his goals]{.underline}.

In the coming weeks, as more details about Khashoggi's killing emerge,
Mohammed bin Salman will have to recover from the significant
reputational blow that he and his country have taken. He will likely do
so by showing strength. This could take many forms. [It is in the
interest of the United States to make the case that he can achieve
strength through real political reform, as opposed to crackdown.
"]{.underline}Encouraging public debate and discussion by relaxing his
grip on the country's media, as well as releasing those jailed for
expressing their views, would prove that he is indeed a true reformer,"
Khashoggi wrote.

#### Leveraging arms sales perceived as hard line position on human rights

If Saudi Arabia is responsible for the disappearance of Washington Post
columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes the U.S.
must act fast to punish its Middle East ally.

The senator was responding to President [Trump\'s]{.underline} comment
Thursday that he is [not considering halting the sale of arms to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} in light of the disappearance of Khashoggi, who is
feared dead.

\"They\'re going to buy them in the future. When you want to influence
Saudi behavior on another topic, you\'re not going to have anything to
threaten them with or hold over their heads. [It isn\'t about the
money,\" Rubio said]{.underline}. \"I don\'t know \[if\] the president
had just been briefed, that\'s how he used to express it, but bottom
line is, the money [--- there\'s not enough money to the world to buy
back our credibility on human rights. If we do not move forward and take
swift action on this, if --- in fact, if and when --- it\'s proven to be
true.\"]{.underline}

"What good does it do us?" Trump told reporters in response to questions
about whether his administration would consider stopping arm sales to
Saudi Arabia.

"We don't like it, and we don't like it even a little bit," Trump said.
"But as to whether or not we should stop \$110 billion from being spent
in this country, knowing the have four or five alternatives, two of them
being very good alternatives, that would not be acceptable to me."

Rubio said he would have phrased the president\'s statement differently
and does not believe the president\'s overall argument.

\"I would have phrased that differently, not about the money.
\[There\'s\] plenty of other countries that want to buy arms. I would
phrase it very differently. Important thing is that when you sell arms,
it\'s true that they can buy from China, Russia or anybody else. [When
you sell arms to Saudi Arabia, it gives you leverage over them because
they need replacement parts, they need the training \... you can\'t
sanction a country by cutting them off if you never provide it in the
first place. It is true that arms sales gives us
leverage]{.underline},\" Rubio said.

\"Never accept this from anyone in the world. Undermines our credibility
and our moral authority around the planet to go after regimes like
Putin\'s or Venezuela or others. [As far as the options are concerned,
people talk about the arm sales, our relationship with Saudi Arabia
extends well beyond arm sales as well]{.underline},\" Rubio said. \"And
I would say it\'s, [unfortunately, because Saudi Arabia is an important
part of our Middle Eastern strategy, they are a key leverage and hedge
point against the influence. That cannot supersede our commitment to
human rights.\"]{.underline}

[The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be greater diplomatic
flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. [Critics might argue]{.underline}
that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, [forgoing arms sales will
eliminate a potential source of leverage]{.underline}. We argue that,
[on the contrary, the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will
outweigh the potential leverage or other benefits from arms
sales]{.underline}. Most importantly[, by refraining from arming nations
engaged in conflict, the United States will have the diplomatic
flexibility to engage with all parties as an honest broker]{.underline}.
The [inherent difficulty of negotiating while arming one side is obvious
today with respect to North and South Korea]{.underline}. After decades
of U.S. support for South Korea, North Korea clearly does not trust the
United States. [Similarly, U.S. attempts to help negotiate a peace deal
between the Israelis and Palestinians have long been complicated by
American support for Israel]{.underline}. To stop arming one side of a
contentious relationship is not to suggest that the United States does
not have a preferred outcome in such cases. Rather, [by staying out of
the military domain the United States can more readily encourage
dialogue and diplomacy]{.underline}.

[Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest.]{.underline} [In the
case of Taiwan, for example]{.underline}, [though]{.underline} it is
clear that [Taiwan needs to purchase weapons]{.underline} from other
countries to provide for its defense, [those weapons do not have to be
made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would
help defuse U.S.-China tensions.]{.underline} Even if Taiwan's defenses
remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in which
American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's
behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in
general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific region. Most
important[, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of
the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan
and China.]{.underline}

Policy Analysis (2011) 7, 275--294 \[aw\]

We test seven hypotheses associated with three different theoretical
models and find mixed results. [There is little evidence in favor of the
Arms for Influence model: there is an inverse relationship between
absolute levels of US military aid and recipient state cooperation, and
there is no relationship at all between recipient state dependence on US
aid and recipient state behavior.]{.underline} Thus, while the Lonely
Superpower hypothesis was on the right track by predicting an unorthodox
relationship between aid and cooperation, it did not perform as well as
some of the Reverse Leverage hypotheses when it came to explaining
exactly what form such unorthodoxy would take.

In several ways, [the Reverse Leverage model was quite
accurate]{.underline}: (i) [states receiving military aid from the
United States exhibit lower levels of cooperation than states that do
not receive military aid]{.underline}, (ii) in the population of all
states, [higher levels of military aid appear to produce more defiant
behavior, and]{.underline} (iii) [the United States does not punish
defiance with reductions in aid or reward greater cooperation with
increases in military aid]{.underline}. Together, these results suggest
that [US military assistance is allocated for reasons that are largely
independent of overall recipient state behavior toward the United
States]{.underline}. The Reverse Leverage model contends that
**[military aid is delivered to states that the United States depends on
for security reasons]{.underline}**. **[Realizing their leverage over
Washington, states that receive high amounts of aid are actually more
able to engage in uncooperative behavior than are states that the United
States does not depend so heavily upo]{.underline}**n. We attempted to
test for the effects of an aid recipient's ''security value'' directly
by comparing US allies to nonallies. Consistent with the Reverse
Leverage model, we find that [states with a defensive alliance with the
United States are more likely to receive US military aid but less likely
to respond to aid by increasing their cooperation with American
preferences.]{.underline}

[The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms sales
specifically is quite mixed]{.underline}. [U.S. arms sales may have
improved Israeli security over the years]{.underline}, for example[, but
American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a durable peace
settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact]{.underline}.
[Nor have arms sales provided the United States with enough leverage
over the years to prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey,
Indonesia, and Morocco from invading their neighbors. Nor have arms
sales helped restrain the human rights abuses]{.underline} of clients
like Chile or Libya, or various Middle Eastern client states. [Although
the United States has used the promise of arms sales or the threat of
denying arms successfully from time to time, the failures outnumber the
victories.]{.underline} [The most rigorous study conducted to tease out
the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are
successful]{.underline} is a 1994 study by John Sislin.67 Collating 191
attempts between 1950 and 1992, Sislin [codes]{.underline} 80 of those
attempts ([42 percent) successful]{.underline}. Sislin's analysis is
incomplete, however, since he looks only at the immediate benefits of
arms sales [and does not consider the long-term
consequences.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [a close look at the supposedly successful attempts reveals
that many of them are cases in which the United States is in fact simply
buying something rather than actually "influencing"]{.underline} another
nation. Thirty of the [cases Sislin coded as successful were instances
of the United States using arms to buy access to military
bases]{.underline} (20 cases) or to [raw materials]{.underline} (5

Providing Weaponry to Governments Suspected of Human Rights Violations

[Many Members of Congress take an interest in trying to ensure respect
for human rights around the world, especially in countries that maintain
close relations with the United States and over which the United States
arguably has a degree of influence through its provision of arms or
other services for purposes of building partner capacity]{.underline}
(BPC). 119 [However, this]{.underline} interest has also been observed
to [create tension between a desire to support the rule of law and
personal freedoms in various countries and the security implications of
potentially harming cooperation with partner government]{.underline}s.
At a March 2017 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, [CENTCOM
Commander General Joseph L. Votel said]{.underline},

\[[i\]n recent years we have seen an increase in restrictions placed on
assistance provided to partner nations, limiting their ability to
acquire U.S. equipment based on human rights]{.underline} and/or
political oppression of minority groups. While these are significant
challenges that must be addressed, [the use of FMF and FMS \[Foreign
Military Sales\] as a mechanism to achieve changes in behavior has
questionable effectiveness and can have unintended consequences\.... We
should avoid using the programs as a lever of influence or denial to our
own detriment]{.underline}.120

This tension, typically framed as one between values and security, or as
one between different types of security, often plays out in the Middle
East, and [arms sales are a critical part of the equation]{.underline}.

#### No global modeling ---laundry list...death penalty, torture, due process all alt causes

**Jarolímek-Proner and Searle 07** \[Frank, Executive Director at the

[**http://www.cceia.org/resources/ethics_online/0012.html**](http://www.un.org/democracyfund/XStaffRolandRich.htm)\]

[The issue of capital punishment remains a source of friction between
the United States and the international community]{.underline}. At the
opening of the 62nd UN General Assembly session this September, the
European Union, in continuing its campaign for the promotion and
entrenchment of human rights, will once more introduce a resolution
calling for a global moratorium on executions. Despite the expected
backing of a majority in the General Assembly and 58 percent of
Americans believing a moratorium is necessary while the capital process
is thoroughly
reviewed,[1](http://thejakartaglobe.com/world/to-game-theorists-kim-jong-il-a-model-of-rational-irrationality/338059)
few will dispute Nobel Peace Prize recipient [Jody
Williams](http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/numbers/20/1129.html), a supporter
of the resolution, in her assessment, \"It is quite unlikely that a UN
approved moratorium will influence the U.S. on the death penalty.\"

Yet, the United States has always been explicitly committed to
promulgating international human rights. Indeed, the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard_College), signed in 1948, is
largely the result of successful diplomatic endeavors to export American
constitutional values to the rest of the world. More recently, an
Executive Order signed by President Bill Clinton on the 50th anniversary
of the UN\'s Declaration on Human Rights in 1998 stated that:

It shall also be the policy and practice of the Government of the United
States to promote respect for international human rights, both in our
relationships with all other countries and by working with and
strengthening the various international mechanisms for the promotion of
human rights, including . . . those of the United Nations . .
.[3](http://www.cceia.org/resources/ethics_online/0012.html)

The United States has signed numerous treaties that codify and protect
human rights held as universal and inalienable. The furthest reaching of
these, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR),[4](http://www.reuters.com/places/japan) was signed by 148
countries and described by the U.S. State Department as \"the most
complete and authoritative articulation of international human rights
law that has emerged in the years following World War
II.\"[5](http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf) [The United
States has consistently ratified such treaties with specific
reservations regarding provisions that could affect its policies on
capital punishment, or not ratified them at
all.[6](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0451625463/theatlanticmonthA/)
This has produced a divergence between international human rights norms
and those of the United States, and as a result, triggered accusations
of human rights
violations]{.underline}.[7](http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/04/kelly.htm)

As a result, many argue that [the United States is eroding its moral
authority, gradually becoming an anti-model rather than a role
model]{.underline} at a time of mounting need for international
cooperation and coordination to maintain peace and security. [This is
becoming clear as global and internal concerns emerge over policies on
human right issues such as torture, due process, extraordinary
rendition, and lethal injection.]{.underline}

### AT Net Benefit: Democracy

#### No impact to democracy 

**Mousseau 18** -- Professor @ UCF, PhD PoliSci @ Binghamton \[Michael,
*Conflict Management and Peace Science*, "Grasping the scientific
evidence: The contractualist peace supersedes the democratic peace",
*Vol 35(2) 175-192,* SagePub, accessed 8/21/18\]

No one has challenged the multiple reports that contractualist economy
is the strongest nontrivial predictor of peace both within (Mousseau,
2012b) and between nations (Mousseau, 2013; see also Nieman, 2015). The
only matter in controversy is whether democracy has any impact on peace
after consideration of contractualist economy. [I]{.underline}
[investigated all five reasons offered in the literature]{.underline}
(excluding already-refuted arguments) [to think democracy causes
peace]{.underline}, **[and found no support for any of
them]{.underline}**. [The correlation of **democracy with peace is
zero**]{.underline} regardless of how contractualist economy or
interstate conflict is measured; the disaggregation of the data yields
no support for a causal interaction of democracy with contractualist
economy, and the state of knowledge offers no evidence of causation from
democracy to contractualist economy and peace.

[While some correlation of democracy with peace appears in
analyses]{.underline} of all disputes (at the 0.10 level), [this appears
to be a **statistical artifact**, since democracy is **near zero** in
analyses of wars, fatal-only disputes]{.underline} (Mousseau, 2009,
2012a, 2013 and above), [and militarized crises]{.underline} (Mousseau
et al., 2013a, b). Analyses of all-disputes are less accurate than those
of fataldisputes and crises because they are more likely to include
events that are not state-to-state confrontations, and more likely to
under-report events occurring in clientelist dyads. We saw that
clientelist democracies tend to be geographically dispersed, and this
may account for the non-fatal peace, which does not exist in bordering
dyads where everyone has an equal chance to fight. The non-fatal
correlation of democracy with peace is also marginal, as we saw in Table
4 that it includes only 27% of dyads and only 50% of joint-democratic
dyads.

This study largely investigated unsupported assertions of fact and
showed them to lack support: neither DOR nor Ray (2013) properly
supported their claims that multiple imputation, the treatment of
ongoing dispute years, an interaction, the adoption of an alternative
measure for contractualist economy, or reverse causality actually
restore the evidence for the democratic peace. In this way this study
merely corroborated what was already the state of knowledge, and it
would be a mistake to think there are continuing factual differences in
this controversy. I cannot promise that the analyses herein are error
free, and I fully expect defenders of the democratic peace to carefully
scrutinize them for errors, but no claim of error should be perceived as
resurrecting the correlation of democracy with peace unless it is also
shown to change results.

Nor has anyone disputed the overturning of the democratic peace as
reported in two studies (Mousseau, 2009, 2012a). While DOR (205) assert
that the analyses in Mousseau (2009) are based on a misinterpreted
interaction term, there is no such interaction term in Mousseau (2009).
[The only evidence-based defense of the democratic peace that exists
today comes from DOR's 120 regressions, **101 of which are invalid**. Of
the 19 valid ones, **only 15 are of fatal disputes** that count, and
every one of these 15 regressions is mired by one of two questionable
practices: five include control for the DemocracyH term that is said to
**artificially inflate** the democracy coefficient; 10 are irrelevant
because they include the **inconsequential interaction term**
additionally calculated at the misleading 75th percentile of
contractualist economy]{.underline}. **[If there is a correlation of
democracy with peace, why cannot this be shown in a clear-cut
regression?]{.underline}**

Causality, not statistics, lies at the core of this controversy, and
causality cannot be directly seen: it can only be theorized and
corroborated. Yet defenders of the democratic peace have not addressed
any of the extensive corroborations of economic norms theory accrued in
studies of civil conflict and insurgency (Mousseau, 2012b), terrorism
(Meierrieks, 2012; Boehmer and Daube, 2013; Krieger and Meierrieks,
2015), democratization (Aytacx et al., 2016), and human rights (Mousseau
and Mousseau, 2008). The weight of evidence for economic norms theory
overwhelms any theory of democracy causing peace (Ungerer, 2012), yet
defenders of the proposition have sought only to report some
statistically significant correlation of democracy with peace, as if
correlation equals causation (Dafoe, 2011; Dafoe and Russett, 2013; DOR;
Ray, 2013; Russett, 2010).

Nor is there any scientific basis for concluding that this controversy
is ultimately unresolvable because the factors are closely related, as
is frequently asserted without support (e.g. DOR: 203). The relevant
factors are not closely related: contractualist economy is only
moderately correlated with trade interdependence (0.31), income
(0.71/0.56), and democracy (0.47) (Mousseau, 2013: 191--193). That
contractualist nations are almost always democratic does not mean that
democratic nations are almost always contractualist, and the majority
57% of democracies had clientelist economies from 1950 to 2010. The
notion that democracy, market development, and trade are synonymous is
rooted in ignorance, and ignorance cannot justify discarding, after the
fact, our carefully constructed measures and datasets.13

The implications of this study are far from trivial: [the democratic
peace]{.underline}, defined as democracy causing peace, [lacks the
evidentiary core on which it is based]{.underline}; [the observation of
democratic peace is best explained by contract norms.]{.underline} **[If
our field is to abide by scientific rules of evidence]{.underline}**,
then our [scholars **must stop** describing democracy as a ''known''
cause, or correlate, of peace, and we must stop tossing in a variable
for democracy, willy-nilly, in quantitative analyses of international
conflict]{.underline}. The variable to replace it is contractualist
economy, which not only subsumes democracy but is now the most powerful
non-trivial factor in the study of international conflict, whose impact
is more than 10 times that which we once thought democracy had.

No historical study is immune to criticism, but the progress of
knowledge will not be furthered with another (third) round of ardently
asserted claims of error that are not shown to change results. [I
understand the prior view of democratic peace is **known and
intuitive**]{.underline} and the contractualist peace is less so, and
unsupported assertions are enough for many to believe in already-known
claims. However, [the purpose of science is to promote rather than
stifle innovation]{.underline}, and to differentiate good ideas from bad
ones. Better yet are new ideas that can help make the world a better
place, and economic norms theory is clear on that: if the wealthy
market-oriented nations wish to advance democracy and peace around the
world, the way to do that is to promote economic opportunity.

his father (King Salman) embarked on building this facility very early
after he took charge of the Defense Ministry," he told CNBC in an email
Wednesday. "[It]{.underline} [underscores a willingness to ignore
Washington's interests and policies from the beginning of his rise to

Could Washington be underestimating Saudi capabilities? The AEI's Rubin

Satellite imagery reportedly revealing [a ballistic missile facility
deep in the Saudi desert spotlights Riyadh's increased investment in its
independent warfighting capabilities,]{.underline} U.S. defense experts
say.

[This, they believe, indicates a growing desire by the longtime ally to
be able to take offensive measures without the approval of]{.underline}
its main weapons sponsors in [Washington]{.underline}.

"There's an arms race underway," Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon
official and Arab affairs expert at the American Enterprise Institute,
told CNBC. "[Whiplash policy changes in Washington have had their impact
on Riyadh: Saudi authorities are no longer going to be constrained by
White House whispers. The Saudis are demonstrating that they can take
matters into their own hands]{.underline}."

[Images]{.underline} analyzed by missile defense experts at the
Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California,
and first reported by The Washington Post, [appear to show the testing
and possible manufacturing of ballistic missiles. These can carry
nuclear warheads to targets thousands of miles from their launch
point]{.underline}. International powers have sanctioned Iran for its
own frequent testing of the weapons.

As America's top weapons buyer and foremost security partner in the Arab
world, o[ne might question why Riyadh would need to invest in its own
ballistic missile facility. It already has a fleet of top-of-the-line
F-15 fighter jets, Tornados and Typhoons]{.underline}, giving it an
airpower advantage over regional arch-rival Iran, the majority of whose
air force hasn't been updated since the 1970s.

[The catch is that Saudi Arabia's air force still needs maintenance and
logistics support from the jets' countries of origin --- the U.S. and
the U.K. --- and that support could be terminated]{.underline} if the
aircraft is used in an unapproved manner. [Homegrown missiles,
meanwhile, have no such limit. Furthermore, missiles don't need pilots
who require training]{.underline} and risk being shot down and captured
by the enemy.

[Saudi Arabia has put the U.S. on a shortlist with China, Russia and
others to bid for nuclear power projects]{.underline} in the country.
Washington sees Saudi Arabia as a big customer of American nuclear
expertise and hardware, [but lawmakers from both U.S. political parties
are demanding a deal be based on tough controls.]{.underline}

[Section 123]{.underline} of the United States Atomic Energy Act of
1954, titled "Cooperation With Other Nations," [sets an agreement for
cooperation as a prerequisite for nuclear deals between the U.S. and any
other nation]{.underline}. Under a "123 measure," [any U.S. nuclear deal
with Saudi Arabia would prohibit routes toward the making of nuclear
weapons by banning enrichment of uranium or the reprocessing of
plutonium.]{.underline}

Speaking to CNBC's Hadley Gamble at the Munich Security Conference on
Saturday, the [U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary]{.underline} Dan
[Brouillette, said such an agreement was imperative to any nuclear deal
with Riyadh.]{.underline}

"We won't allow them to bypass 123 if they want to have civilian nuclear
power that includes U.S. nuclear technologies."

The senior energy official said as countries pursued more
environmentally friendly and emissions-free technologies, nuclear had to
be a part of the conversation. And while countries should pursue nuclear
energy technologies they must do so under a U.S. regime that prevents
the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

"As you know this technology has a dual use and in the wrong hands it
becomes a dangerous, dangerous world," said Brouillette.

[The Saudis have so far refused to rule out their right to enrich
uranium for nuclear weapons, pointing to neighboring Iran's ability to
do so]{.underline} under the 2015 nuclear agreement that world powers
struck with Tehran.

In an interview in March on CBS's "60 Minutes" [Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman said the country wasn't interested in developing
weapons but would develop nuclear capability should Iran ever develop a
working nuclear bomb.]{.underline}

On Sunday, [Saudi Arabian Prince Turki Al-Faisal responded directly to
Brouillette's words, saying the country had more options than just U.S.
technology.]{.underline}

"Well [the nuclear energy market is open. It is not just the United
States that is providing nuclear technology]{.underline}," he told
CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Munich.

"[We have France, we have Russia, we have China. We have our friends in
Pakistan and in other places as well, so if they want to remove
themselves from that market, well, that's up to them]{.underline}."

[A leak of classified documents]{.underline} from the French Directorate
of Military Intelligence [shows that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates are extremely dependent on U.S. and European weapons for their
war on Yemen]{.underline}. [The documents]{.underline}, released by
French investigative journalism organization Disclose and translated by
the Intercept, [reveal that the U.S.,]{.underline} France, and the U.K[.
assist coalition forces with targeting,]{.underline} making these
countries complicit in war crimes; that France is aware that their
weapons are routinely used in attacking civilians in Yemen; [and that
Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. are so dependent on NATO weaponry that it would
take decades to replace it with Chinese or Russian weapons and to
retrain soldiers with the new equipment]{.underline}.

[The documents illustrate how crucial U.S. and Western ally support is
to the war in Yemen]{.underline}, explained The Real News Network's Greg
Wilpert[. If Saudi Arabia were to stop buying arms from the U.S. and its
allies they could not easily substitute them with other weapons
purchases]{.underline}, which contradicts the argument made by the U.S.
and other governments that the war would continue regardless of their
involvement.

"[There is not a clear path for them to just switch over to Russian
manufactured weapons]{.underline}. It\'s kind of like switching from
Macintosh to Microsoft. [It\'s just not an easy transition. It takes a
lot of time,]{.underline}" Hassan [El-Tayyab, co-director of Just

majorities that want to end this war. And [now we have proof just how
urgent that is and how much we could impact the situation on the ground
for millions of Yemenis that are living on the brink of famine by
stopping these arms sales]{.underline}."

[One former senior official suggested tying arm sales to different sets
of purposes]{.underline}, "I think Congress should pause all FMS and end
other support to the Saudi campaign in Yemen. [Resumption of arms sales
should be conditioned on Riyadh agreeing]{.underline} to a fully
transparent international investigation into the Khashoggi incident,
regular intelligence community assessments of Saudi efforts to reduce
civilian casualties in Yemen, and a report from the administration
outlining their strategy for addressing the humanitarian crisis in Yemen
and producing a peaceful settlement."

[Another]{.underline} former senior official [supported a clean break
from U.S. support for the Yemen war rather than a piecemeal
approach]{.underline}. "On Yemen, [the best move would be to support the
Khanna-Murphy War Powers resolution. A clean end to US military support
for the Saudi-UAE war in Yemen is better than more targeted efforts to
police that support]{.underline} (like the bar on in-flight refueling).
[Suspending existing DCS licenses and placing limits on future foreign
military sales for things like air-to-ground strike capabilities would
be a natural supplement to this]{.underline} approach," the former
official said.

Jeffrey [Prescott, who served as Special Assistant to the President and
Senior Director for Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf States on the
National Security Council and now a strategic consultant to the Penn
Biden Center expressed a similar perspective]{.underline}, "My view is
that the callous murder of Mr. Khashoggi --- and the Trump
administration's clear impulse to sweep it under the rug ---
demonstrates how far the relationship with Saudi Arabia has gotten off
track, and the need for serious consequences. As a start, [we could use
this moment to extricate ourselves from military involvement in the
disastrous war in Yemen, a step that is long overdue. Ideally we would
simultaneously help push for a diplomatic resolution of the conflict --
necessary, not easy, and very unlikely]{.underline} given how little
effort the Trump administration has put into serious diplomacy. [But
washing our hands of involvement in the war, even in the absence of a US
diplomatic push, will still put pressure on UAE and Saudi to end the
conflict."]{.underline}

Rocks: THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR SAUDI ARABIA
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/>
4/16/19 \[aw\]

[Arms exports are best used for maintaining or strengthening
relationships while limiting adversary access to client states; a tool
of nuanced influence, not outright coercion]{.underline}. In fact,
**[threatening to withhold arms sales to coerce a state into changing
its behavior often has the opposite effect, leading clients to diversify
their arms sourcing instead of shifting course]{.underline}**.
Similarly, calls to restrict technology transfer and worries about
demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as "design technology
transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity" level of transfer. Both
are explained in more detail below, but for now it is worth noting that
design transfer, the level at which most of these offsets occur, does
not lead to the creation of an independent defense industry, but instead
provides the United States with a source of political power. The United
States should not fear technology transfer, but with the appropriate
end-user controls, encourage it. Additionally, while a large domestic
market provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing financial
gains for political influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially
when it comes to preserving complex production lines for future
flexibility. Finally, [the United States should not look to use an arms
embargo to coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but
simply because it is unlikely to work.]{.underline}

Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms

[Arms sales are useful tools for maintaining communication,
strengthening relationships, and keeping potential adversary states at
bay]{.underline}. Conversely, [as a blunt instrument of coercion (i.e.
if you do not do X, we will suspend Y), they are likely
losers]{.underline}. [Senior U.S. government officials involved in the
arms transfer process]{.underline} that I interviewed over the past year
during the course of my research [have echoed similar sentiments. This
is also borne out by previous research providing evidence that using
arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successfu]{.underline}l. Interestingly, [coercion attempts using arms
transfers are least likely to be successful when used as a punishment or
threat against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}
Instead[, punishments in the form of an embargo can often push a client
to diversify sourcing rather than to change behavior.]{.underline}

[Consider Indonesia and Egypt. In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian MiG-29M/M2s and more than two-dozen French
Rafales]{.underline}. [This represented a shocking turn of events after
more than three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter jets.
It was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo put in place in 2013,
after the Egyptian army's removal of then-President Mohamed
Morsi,]{.underline} who had won the presidency in a 2012 election. [The
embargo caused significant tension between the two states]{.underline}
driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a point of mortal peril"
while the United States was moralizing about democratic reforms.
Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo in 2015 with virtually
no change in Egyptian policies, no official U.S. "democracy
certification", and Egyptian military support for the Saudi-led war in
Yemen. **The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of coercive change was an
abject failure.**]{.underline}

[A similar story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A
long-time arms client of the United States with no history of Russian
imports, Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003]{.underline} to
purchase Russian Su-27/30s. While Indonesia was always far more
politically neutral than Egypt, [this remarkable turnaround in arms
sourcing diversification appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo
implemented in 1999 in response to Indonesia's apparent human rights
violations]{.underline} carrying out heavy-handed military actions in
East Timor[. Furious at U.S. meddling in something the government
considered a domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to Russia with the
specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\] arms sales
restrictions.]{.underline}" In other words, [Indonesia looked to
diversify, not capitulate. Indonesia continued sourcing Russian arms
even after the United States lifted the embargo in 2005]{.underline}.
Perhaps most remarkably, [even after the United States agreed to give
Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012, the archipelago state still agreed to
purchase 11 Russian Su-35s]{.underline}. **[The U.S. attempt at coercion
not only failed but continues to perpetuate negative strategic effects
today.]{.underline}**
