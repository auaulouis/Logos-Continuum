2019 "Trump's Veto on Yemen War Is a Sign That the Strongmen in the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia Are Winning"
https://theintercept.com/2019/04/18/trump-veto-yemen-saudi-arabia-mbs/

ON TUESDAY, Donald Trump invoked his veto power for only the second time
in his presidency. [Trump]{.underline}'s move [struck]{.underline} [down
a congressional resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in
Yemen]{.underline}. In doing so, [he stifled a moment of rare
bipartisanship]{.underline}, [flexing his own authoritarian]{.underline}
[tendencies]{.underline} **[to protect a fellow autocrat]{.underline}**,
the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is known by the initials
MBS.

By doing so, [Trump]{.underline} not only [**signaled his loyalty to a
prince**]{.underline} who has been widely implicated in the murder of
Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as the imprisonment
and torture of numerous human rights activists, but [he has also ensured
that the **U.S. would remain complicit**]{.underline} in the world's
worst humanitarian crisis. Far from an effort to protect the
Constitution, as Trump claimed, [the veto was rather the latest example
of the autocratic, tit-for-tat deal-making that has in recent years
increasingly dominated the geopolitics of the Middle East]{.underline}.

Trump made clear that his decision was intended to augment his executive
powers. In his statement, he called the bill --- which would have made
history as the first legislation under the 1973 War Powers Act to
receive bipartisan support --- a "dangerous attempt to weaken \[his\]
constitutional authorities." Trump said that scaling back U.S.
involvement in the deadly Yemen conflict would imperil "American
citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future."

[The bill]{.underline}, though, just like the president's objection to
it, [had]{.underline} [much more to do with Trump's
relentless]{.underline} and ill-advised [devotion to MBS]{.underline}.
The resolution first gained momentum in the aftermath of Khashoggi's
murder in October 2018, a crime that many --- including the U.S.
intelligence community --- have linked to the crown prince. MBS is also
responsible for leading the coalition of Persian Gulf states in its
four-year offensive in Yemen, which has left thousands of Yemeni
civilians dead and millions ravaged by famine and disease. In addition
to overseeing this disastrous war, MBS has also ordered numerous
crackdowns on his own civilians, including mass arrests and alleged
torture of nonviolent human rights advocates. By calling for an end to
U.S. support for the war, Congress took aim at Trump's obstinate and
increasingly untenable loyalty to MBS. Since Khashoggi's killing, even
staunch supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, such as Sen. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., have grown critical of Riyadh. In contrast, [**Trump has
persistently ignored the ongoing abuse of Saudi human rights activists
and downplayed the mounting catastrophe in Yemen, calling Saudi Arabia a
"truly spectacular ally**."]{.underline} IT WAS NO great surprise, then,
to see the president resort to veto power to protect MBS's disastrous
Yemen campaign. Beneath the shallow appeals to constitutionalism and
national security, Trump is acting in accordance with a now-familiar
pattern: gravitating toward fellow strongmen and personality-driven
deal-making. This entrepreneurial narcissism has fueled much of the
president's volatile foreign policy, from his on-again-off-again
"relationships" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
dictator Kim Jong-un to his rabid devotion to building a wall on the
Mexican border. This trend has dramatic implications in the Middle East.
Since the collapse of the Arab Spring and in the wake of years of
foreign intervention, hopes of democracy in the region have in large
part given way to a cast of authoritarian rulers. From MBS in Saudi
Arabia to Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey to the recently re-elected
Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, the region has grown increasingly
polarized under hawkish, right-wing leaders. Among this fray, **[Trump,
along with his his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, identified MBS
as an ideal partner]{.underline}. [The president and crown prince share
a]{.underline}**n alarmist **[message of Iran as a regional
menace]{.underline}** and both use this stance to justify destabilizing
policies, such as the dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal and the war
in Yemen. **[Trump has also lauded MBS and the Saudis for their alleged
work to curb extremism in the region]{.underline}**, despite reports
that Riyadh has cut deals with Al Qaeda fighters in Yemen. For his
ongoing support, which includes billions in arms sales, Trump has
expected cooperation from the Saudis on his own regional agenda,
including in his efforts to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict. Trump
and Kushner are preparing to push for this "deal of the century" in
coming months --- a negotiation that has far more to do with backroom
bargaining than any democratic or humanitarian concerns. The veto, for
all its cynical implications about the state of U.S. foreign policy,
should also concern Americans at home. Tuesday's announcement came
barely a month after Trump's first veto, which he used to enforce his
border statement of emergency over congressional opposition. So Trump
went to the outer limits of legality in pursuit of an irrational pet
project, the so-called border wall with Mexico, at great financial and
human cost. Such actions are only the logical extension of a presidency
that began with the morally indefensible and constitutionally untenable
"Muslim ban," issued by executive order in the first days of the
administration. The president has repeatedly availed himself of these
personalized, unilateral mechanisms of power. The effects of such a
pattern cannot be held at bay by the occasional congressional override
or dissident judge. Americans must recognize this dangerous erosion of
democratic principles and, fighting fatigue, continue to resist.

[Saudi Arabia is America's longest-standing ally in the Middle East,
even though the kingdom is not a partner made in heaven]{.underline} for
the United States. Its citizens, including Osama bin Laden, have been
involved in numerous terrorist attacks against the United States, most
consequentially on 9/11. Saudi Arabia is not a democracy. It fuels
Islamist extremism far beyond its borders through its exports of
ultraconservative Wahhabi religious doctrine. Its human rights practices
are often deplorable, and occasionally medieval. Its treatment of women
is unacceptable. It has used oil in the past as a weapon against U.S.
national interests. It bombs innocent civilians in Yemen. It
occasionally threatens to acquire nuclear weapons. It promises huge sums
of money to worthy regional actors, and then often fails to deliver. It
blockades Qatar. And now, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman apparently
ordered the execution in Istanbul of journalist and Washington Post
columnist Jamal Khashoggi.227 All this has produced a flood of U.S.
criticism of Saudi Arabia and calls to sanction Riyadh, end U.S.-Saudi
military cooperation in Yemen, cut off arms sales, and overall rupture
the intensity and substance of the bilateral relationship. As the
Washington Post editorial page put it, "Who Needs Saudi Arabia?"228

The president's answer is that **[the United States does]{.underline}**,
and he is right.229 The murder of Khashoggi, including its barbarous
method, was as abhorrent as it was stupid. But [bin Salman]{.underline}
[is the most powerful man in Saudi Arabia and its likely future
king]{.underline}. At this writing, [he]{.underline} is thirty-three
years old and [could easily rule the kingdom]{.underline} **[for the
next four decades]{.underline}** and beyond, well after Trump and many
of his current critics are dead. Thus [the United States will most
likely have to deal with him **for a long time**.]{.underline} [Making
an enemy of him now is not a good idea]{.underline}, [especially given
the many other challenges the United States faces in the
region.]{.underline}

Moreover, Mohammed [bin Salman]{.underline}, [though
authoritarian]{.underline}, [espouses a moderate and modern
message]{.underline} (in Saudi terms) [and is the leader **most likely
to keep extremist forces from gaining power and influence**]{.underline}
in the kingdom. [An unstable Saudi Arabia would be a preeminent source
of potential terrorists and radical ideology]{.underline}. Further,
[without Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, [the United States cannot have a
coherent and effective policy to counter Iran's hegemonic activities in
the Middle East.]{.underline} [No other Arab state could be the hub of
such an **indispensable U.S. effort.**]{.underline} And although the
United States has dramatically reduced its dependence on Saudi oil, [the
global economy and the economies]{.underline} [of U.S. treaty allies
depend on energy from the kingdom]{.underline}.230

In addition, [the]{.underline} U.S. [security relationship]{.underline}
with Saudi Arabia [goes well beyond arms sales: it]{.underline} also
[involves]{.underline} [intense intelligence community]{.underline}
[collaboration]{.underline} [and significant financing for
counterterrorist]{.underline} [campaigns]{.underline}.231 To add to the
list, Mohammed [bin Salman has]{.underline} a [different and more benign
view toward Israel than do many other Arab rulers]{.underline}, and as
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert observes, "[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} is the country that in the end [will
determine]{.underline} [the ability of the Arabs to reach a compromise
with Israel]{.underline}."232 Moreover, [without reliable U.S. military
protection]{.underline}, **[Riyadh might well seek to acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. Finally[, if the United States weakens its
partnership]{.underline} with Saudi Arabia, U.S. [adversaries China and
Russia **will fill the vacuum**,]{.underline} [including]{.underline}
[by providing the kingdom with nuclear]{.underline} [reactors **without
full-scope safeguards**]{.underline}---a line Riyadh should not cross.
[Saudi Arabia needs the United States at least as much as the United
States needs it.]{.underline} Washington should be stout in defending
its equities in dealing with Riyadh. But this [mutual dependence is an
enduring strength of the bilateral relationship]{.underline}. It should
not be damaged because of Saudi Arabia's sometimes problematic policies.

Trump Grade on Saudi Arabia Policy: B+

#### Nuclear war

**Ismail '15** (Muhammad Ismail, Ph.D. in Political Science @ Qurtuba
University, assistant professor @ Qurtuba University, teaches
master-level Political Science courses. "Iran's Nuclear Program:
Regional Implications and Possible Outcomes," 2015 in *Asian Politics &
Policy*, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aspp.12184/epdf)

While some observers talk about the inevitability of nuclear
proliferation in West Asia should Iran develops its own nuclear weapons,
others do not agree. Bahgat (2007b, pp. 66, 86, 118, 123--124, 213)
believes that a nuclear weapons option is highly unlikely for Saudi
Arabia, based on an understanding of its relationship with the United
States. This article contends, however, that [[it is **highly possible**
that]{.mark} [Saudi Arabia]{.mark} [may opt for nuclear weapons]{.mark}
technology of its own]{.underline}. According to leaked U.S. diplomatic
cables, King Abdullah had, on several occasions, advised the U.S.
government to carry out preemptive attacks on Iranian nuclear
facilities. These cables also describe how other Arab countries in West
Asia have secretly argued for forceful military action against Iran's
nuclear program. [Saudi Arabia's energy consumption has been rising, so
it recognizes the necessity of developing nuclear power to increase
reservoirs of energy. If the Saudi government develops nuclear plants to
generate electricity, then it could possibly go in the direction of
**producing nuclear weapons** should Iran declare itself a
NWS]{.underline}. [Although Saudi Arabia has signed the]{.underline}
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ([NPT]{.underline}),
Iran's nuclear program might make a Saudi nuclear program inevitable
(Black, 2013; Lake & Rogin, 2014). [[Saudi Arabia and Iran have been
**arch-enemies**]{.mark} since the 1979 Islamic Revolution]{.underline}.
[One reason is that they have longstanding religious
tensions]{.underline}. One represents the Sunni Wahabi sect of Islam and
the other Shiite sect of Islam. [This division brought religious
animosity into regional politics as well, because both nations harbor
hopes of exercising Islamic leadership]{.underline}. Moreover,
[[the]{.mark} Saudi and Iranian [governments are locked in a **violent**
and **frightening competition**]{.mark} over Lebanon's internal
politics]{.underline}. The Iranian government supports Hezbollah while
Saudi Arabia openly supports the Sunnis and Christians in Lebanon.
Following after the 2006 Lebanon-Israel War, the Saudi and Iranian
governments used their respective influence over the different Lebanese
political factions to find a political settlement (Wehrey et al., 2009).
Furthermore, [the two nations possess different views about the regional
security order]{.underline}, [with the [Saudis fearful that]{.mark} a
nuclear [Iran will become]{.mark} more [powerful and will
threaten]{.mark} [its]{.mark} immediate West Asian [neighbors by
**igniting Shiite beliefs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, thus, [perceives Iran's nuclear threat more acutely
than the rest of the West Asian states]{.underline}. Iran's nuclear
program could create tensions between these two major powers with
strategic and security repercussions beyond the immediate neighborhood
(Black, 2013; Lake & Rogin, 2014). Historical Background of Saudi
Arabia-Iran Rivalry Relations were not always difficult, however. Before
1979, diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia were normal and
cordial because the United States was a friend to both countries and did
not let them compete with one another (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). The basic
and most important objective of both countries then was to prevent the
spread of the Soviet Union's communist influence in West Asia (Delpech,
2006, p. 79). After 1979, relations soured because of the brand of Islam
and type of government introduced by Khomeini. The Iran-Iraq War
(1980--1988) further deteriorated the bilateral ties between them,
because the Saudi government openly helped Iraq against Iran. The
rivalry between the two countries for regional leadership became intense
in the 1980s and Iran has never forgiven Saudi Arabia for supporting
Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). The
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 again lessened the tension between
Iranian and Saudi governments but in the 1990s, Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani did not do enough to revive the cordial relations
between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Under the reformist Muhammad Khatami,
during the last years of 1990s and early 2000s, top-level bilateral
relations improved (Delpech, 2006, p. 79), leading the two nations to
sign an agreement on regional security in April 2001. Then, in February
2002, [Prince Abdullah openly repudiated reference to Iran as part of
the "Axis of Evil"]{.underline} (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). The Persian Gulf
States are nearer to Iran than other states and they have been thought
of as being more concerned about Iran's nuclear quest. [Soon after
establishing a new theocratic model of government in 1979]{.underline},
[the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini spoke openly against the
Arab governments, questioned the legitimacy of the ruling monarchical
families of the neighboring Persian Gulf States, and has continuously
called for replacing these monarchical regimes with Islamic type of
governments the way they had established in Iran. This attitude of the
Iranian ruling class toward helping non state actors to oust the Saudi
monarchy led to the deterioration of erstwhile cordial relations between
the Saudi and Iranian governments]{.underline}. McNaugher (1984) argues
that the Persian Gulf countries are not militarily strong enough to
defend their territorial integrity and sovereignty from external attack.
He further points out that these countries often look abroad for ways of
deterring threats and settling serious disputes among regional players
(p. 517). The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have mainly been
promoting regionalism rather than conflict resolution among their
members. [[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus, ostensibly [[has
only the following]{.mark} [options]{.mark} in response to Iran's
nuclear quest: (1) ignore Iran's nuclear quest; (2) increase its close
association with the United States or formally accept U.S. protection
against any external threat or attack; or (3) [develop its own nuclear
program to counter the Iranian threat]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nuri, 2006,
p. 22). [Due to the nature of distrust between Iran and Saudi Arabia,
the **first option is not viable**]{.underline}. [The second option is
also not viable after the Iran-U.S. rapprochement following the November
deal and because Saudi Arabia wants to decrease its dependency on United
States]{.underline}. [[The third option is the **most viable**]{.mark}
[but it is also the **most dangerous**]{.mark} one]{.underline}. In
fact, [the worst-case implication of Iran's nuclear program on the whole
West Asian region would be that some important states like Saudi Arabia
would opt to develop their own nuclear weapons program]{.underline}.
[Saudi Arabia is one of the most important, strongest, wealthiest, and
biggest states in West Asia and it has the capability to initiate its
own nuclear weapons program]{.underline}, to balance Iranian nuclear
power with the same nuclear-ready status. [[This would]{.mark} [risk
creating an **uncontrollable nuclear arms race**]{.mark} in West
Asia]{.underline}, [making it the most dangerous region in the world
because **[even a minor incident can create havoc]{.mark} in the
region**]{.underline}. No one can tell when the Saudi government might
change its mind and start to develop its own nuclear weapons (Bahgat,
2006, pp. 421--443; Russell, 2008, pp. 521--537), because Saudi Arabia
has a long-standing tradition of hostility toward Iran that goes deeper
than the issue of nuclear weapons (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). Contending
Positions Saudi Arabia's ruling class is worried about possible
preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear installations by the United States
or Israel or by both of them, because in retaliation, the Iranian forces
plus its mercenaries in the region might target U.S. strategic
installations and military bases in the region, especially in the
Persian Gulf States, including the U.S. Air Force base and headquarters
in Qatar (Hersch, 2006, p. 42). In August 2002, the Iranian opposition
group, Mujahedeen-e Khalq revealed that Iran's hidden nuclear activities
were causing discomfort among all its neighboring countries, including
Saudi Arabia. [Saudi Arabia views Iran's nuclear program as a
significant effort toward the domination of the West Asian
region]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}, thus, [took a clear and public
stand against Iran's nuclear quest]{.underline}. After all, Saudi Arabia
does not possess a nuclear weapons program and it has commitments as a
non-NWS under the nuclear NPT signed in 1988. The Saudi government also
signed the safeguards agreement in 2005 declaring that "the kingdom did
not (possess) facilities, nuclear reactors or fissile materials," stated
that the kingdom was "anxious to cooperate continually with the IAEA,"
and pledged to abide by the NPT (Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). Saudi
Arabia also supported the diplomatic talks between Iran and the
Europeans, as failure by the international community to stop Iran's
nuclear quest will certainly have direct repercussions for Saudi Arabia.
However, [Iran's mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle may give impetus to
the Saudi government to opt for nuclear technology. [If Saudi Arabia
opts for its own nuclear program]{.mark}, [its government might seek
help from **Pakistani nuclear research scientists**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Sokolski, 2006, p. 33), [as there is a longstanding close relationship
between the Saudi and Pakistani governments regarding nuclear
technology]{.underline}. It is believed that Saudi Arabia provided
significant funds to Pakistan's nuclear program from the outset, and it
is quite well known that relations between the Saudi and Pakistani
intelligence services have been close for a long time, with Saudi
officials having visited Pakistani military nuclear sites several times
(Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). There were rumors in December 2004 that
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan had signed an agreement by which Islamabad
promised to help the kingdom develop nuclear technology and acquire
missiles that could give it superiority in the regional balance of power
(Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). Iranian professor Abu Mohammed Asgharkani
has stated that Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon were stepped
up when the Iranian government learned of such an agreement between
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan (Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). However, no
confirmation has ever been given so far concerning such reports and the
Saudi government denied it had such plans. The Saudi government said,
"All radioactive products in Saudi Arabia are exclusively for the
purpose of medical and petroleum research" (Delpech, 2006, p. 81).
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi National Security Advisor, had
wanted his government to join the coalition to stop Iran's enrichment
program (Cooper & Rutenberg, 2007). But there were competing voices. In
2002, Prince Naef bin Ahmed Al-Saud, a colonel in the Saudi Arabian
Armed Forces decried that Israel had a total monopoly on nuclear weapons
in the West Asian region, noted that both the Pakistani and Indian
governments refused to obey the nuclear nonproliferation regimes, and
that both Iran and Iraq were trying to develop nuclear programs
(Al-Saud, 2011, pp. 124--130). Turki al-Faisal, who was then in-charge
of Saudi intelligence and became Saudi Arabia's ambassador to
Washington, said that the Arab states would start developing nuclear
programs if the attempt to stop Iran's nuclear quest does not succeed
(see Dagoni, 2012). He also conveyed in unofficial conversations with
important British and U.S. officials that his government was ready to
deal with the Iranian nuclear issue and will use all economic,
diplomatic, and security resources to deal with the Iranian government's
ambitions to achieve regional power status on achieving the status of a
NWS (Dagoni, 2012). Mitchell Reiss argued that the Saudi government
might follow Iran's nuclear quest in anticipation of the failure of
nuclear nonproliferation efforts in the region to stop Iran's nuclear
program (Reiss, 2004, pp. 3--4). Saudi nuclear abilities are not easy to
understand, and there are few indirect statements that tell us that the
Saudis tried to start and develop a nuclear program. The first secretary
of the Saudi Arabian mission to the United Nations (UN) claimed in the
early 1970s that the Saudi government had developed a nuclear program
for military purposes (Guzansky, 2012, p. 34). The prestigious
newspaper, the Guardian also exposed some official papers that showed
Saudis desperately seeking help and support from the US government on
nuclear technology and extended deterrence, as it was believed that a
party less directly involved in the regional politics can be trusted
(Huth, 1999, pp. 25--48; Morgan, 2003, p. 35).

### 2nc -- uq -- arms sales key

#### Saudi alliance strong now -- institutional support and shared interests overwhelm individual relations crises

**Hennigan 2018**

W.J. Hennigan covers the Pentagon and national security issues OCTOBER
18, 2018 "What Makes the U.S.-Saudi Relationship So Special? Weapons,
Oil and \'An Army of Lobbyists\'"
https://time.com/5428669/saudi-arabia-military-relationship/

It's a cold financial calculation: Saudi money for U.S.-made weaponry
results in American jobs.

This is President Donald Trump's rationale in dismissing calls in
Congress to halt future arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the
mysterious disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist and
American resident.

"I don't like the concept of stopping an investment of \$110 billion
into the United States," Trump said last week.

"All they're going to do is say, 'That's OK. We don't have to buy it
from Boeing. We don't have to buy it from Lockheed. We don't have to buy
it from Raytheon and all these great companies. We'll buy it from
Russia. We'll buy it from China," he said.

[The 75-year alliance]{.underline} [between the two nations has been
built on a simple arrangement]{.underline}: [American demand for Saudi
oil]{.underline} [and **Saudi demand** for **American
firepower**]{.underline}.

[It is a relationship]{.underline} **[that is not easily
unwound]{.underline}** [as a bipartisan group]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} U.S. [Senators]{.underline} [found out]{.underline}
earlier this year [when they moved to cut off military
assistance]{.underline} to the Saudis in their war against Houthi rebels
in Yemen. The United Nations has said that more half of the more than
10,000 people who have been killed in the three-year old war are
civilians, and the lives of millions are potentially at risk from
famine.

The U.S. government has provided intelligence, munitions and midair
refueling to Saudi warplanes since operations kicked off in 2015.
Attempts by American lawmakers to stop that aid have thus far failed.

[Saudi Arabia has spent at least \$5.8 million on lobbying Congress this
year]{.underline}, according to data compiled by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a government watchdog. [But recently filed
documents detailing expenses and reimbursements put the actual number
**closer to \$9 million**,]{.underline} said Lydia Dennett, investigator
with the Project on Government Oversight.

"[The Kingdom has a]{.underline} [veritable]{.underline} **[army of
lobbyists]{.underline}** [and PR firms]{.underline} [working to promote
their interests]{.underline} in a wide variety of ways," she said.

The Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative, a left-leaning think tank
in Washington, recently compiled records filed under Foreign Agents
Registration Act that show [in 2017 Saudi lobbyists contacted over 200
members of Congress, including every Senator.]{.underline} The data also
found the [Saudi agents contacted officials in the State
Department]{.underline}, [which oversees foreign military
sales]{.underline}, [nearly 100 times]{.underline}.

**[The Saudi-U.S. relationship is peerless when it comes to arms
sales]{.underline}**. [The kingdom buys more American weapons than any
other nation]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia [accounted for nearly one-fifth
of American of all weapons]{.underline} [exports]{.underline} [over the
past five years]{.underline}, according to a recent report by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

[The Pentagon has a team of U.S. service members]{.underline} based out
of the capital Riyadh [wholly dedicated the "management and
administration of Saudi Arabian Foreign Military Sales]{.underline}." It
serves as a direct pipeline to move weapons from U.S. arms manufacturers
into the arms of the Saudi military.

The U.S. military's Joint Advisory Division works alongside commanders
in each branch of the Saudi military to help fill their weapons needs.
Once the Saudis commit to what they want --- tanks, attack helicopters,
missiles, ships, laser-guided bombs --- the arms packages must be OK'd
by the U.S. Defense and State Departments, and approved by Congress.

The arrangement falls under the U.S. Military Training Mission to Saudi
Arabia, which is led by a two-star American general. The mission is
primarily designed to bolster Saudi Arabia against arch-rival Iran in
order to assert power and influence in the Middle East.

"[We have other]{.underline} very good [allies]{.underline} [in the
Middle East]{.underline}, [but if you look at Saudi Arabia:]{.underline}
[They're an ally and they're a tremendous purchaser of not only military
equipment, but other things]{.underline}," Trump said Wednesday in the
Oval Office.

It was the President's latest attempt to trumpet \$400 billion in
business deals that his administration signed in May 2017 during a
two-day visit to Saudi Arabia. The eye-popping figure includes \$110
billion in military sales, which analysts point out is misleading
because it represented letters of interest and not firmed-up contracts.

Saudi Arabia has thus far only committed to purchase \$14.5
billion-worth of equipment since the announcement was made 17 months
ago. The Administration says the Saudis are currently pursuing more than
\$114 billion in military hardware.

But even if the kingdom moves forward with the sales, the transactions
wouldn't be worth it, according to William D. Hartung, director of the
arms and security project at the Center for International Policy. "Jobs
are no excuse for arming a regime with Saudi Arabia's dismal human
rights record, whether it is its role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi
or its indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen," he said.

The [Khashoggi case has caused an escalating debate on Capitol
Hill]{.underline} [over the U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline}.
Lawmakers on both sides have called for a reappraisal if the kingdom is
found responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance or death.

James Carafano, a vice president at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, says [it's critical that Washington doesn't
rush policy changes]{.underline} [on such an enduring alliance until the
facts are clear]{.underline}. "This isn't an episode of 'Law & Order.'
This is a murder investigation and a murder investigation takes a lot of
time," he said.

[The Trump Administration has repeatedly called for
patience]{.underline}. On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told
reporters outside the White House that the U.S. will give Saudi Arabia a
"few more days" to "conduct a complete, thorough investigation."

"We're all going to get to see the response from Saudi Arabia to this,"
he said. "When we see that, we'll get a chance to determine---all of us
will get a chance to make a determination as to the credibility of the
work that went into that, whether it's truly accurate, fair, and
transparent in the very way they made a personal commitment to me, and
ultimately made a personal commitment to the president when they spoke
to him."

Before taking the short walk back into the White House, [he added that
Saudi Arabia was]{.underline} also "[an important strategic alliance of
the United States]{.underline}. **[We need to be mindful of that as
well."]{.underline}**

WASHINGTON and HALIFAX, Canada --- President Donald [Trump]{.underline}
[released a lengthy statement]{.underline} Tuesday **[justifying the
U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** by [focusing]{.underline}
[on domestic economic benefits]{.underline} [and the threat from
Iran]{.underline} --- and saying he does not know whether Saudi leaders
ordered a journalist's murder.

In the White House statement, Trump repeated disputed claims he won
\$110 billion in U.S.-Saudi arms deals as he signaled he will not move
to take stronger action against Saudi Arabia since the murder of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi and amid the civilian deaths from Saudi-led
airstrikes in Yemen's civil war.

Per Trump, his trip to Saudi Arabia last year landed the mega deal for
weapons as part of a Saudi agreement to spend \$450 billion in the U.S.
--- "a record amount of money" that "will create hundreds of thousands
of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for
the United States.\"

"Of the \$450 billion, \$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of
military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other
great U.S. defense contractors," the statement reads. "If we foolishly
cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous
beneficiaries --- and very happy to acquire all of this newfound
business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United
States!"

[Trump]{.underline}, in the statement, [pointed to Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman's]{.underline} [denials of involvement in
Khashoggi's murder]{.underline}.

"[King Salman and Crown Prince]{.underline} Mohammad bin
[Salman]{.underline} vigorously [deny any knowledge of the]{.underline}
planning or execution of the [murder]{.underline} [of]{.underline} Mr.
[Khashoggi]{.underline}. [Our intelligence agencies continue to assess
all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had
knowledge of this tragic event]{.underline} --- maybe he did and maybe
he didn't!" Trump's statement reads.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the order to kill
Khashoggi on Oct. 2 in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul came from the
highest level of the Saudi leadership. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi
Akar said Saturday that an 18-member "kill team" from Saudi Arabia
carried out the murder of Khashoggi and could have smuggled his body
parts out of the country thanks to their diplomatic status.

Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said Tuesday in an
Arabic-language newspaper interview that claims, including by the CIA,
that Salman gave the order to kill Khashoggi were false.

Though the Trump administration has imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis
accused of involvement in the killing and made a joint decision with
Riyadh to end U.S. refueling of Saudi aircraft involved in the Yemen
war, [Trump's letter signals he will seek to defy the growing call in
Congress to take further action in light of Khashoggi's
death]{.underline}, [like halting U.S. arms sales to the
kingdom.]{.underline}

Trump said in his statement that while he understands members of
Congress may "like to go in a different direction" he would only proceed
if ideas "are consistent with the absolute security and safety of
America."

"As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very
dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and
vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm," he said. "Very
simply it is called America First!"

In a statement Tuesday, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee decried Trump's "disturbing willingness to take the word of
Vladimir Putin or the Saudi Crown Prince over U.S. intelligence
professionals."

"This White House statement is a stunning window into President Trump's
autocratic tendencies, his limited grasp of world affairs, and his
weakness on the world stage. It is shocking to see President Trump
continue to act as an accomplice to a clear cover up by Saudi
leadership," said Sen. Jack Reed, of Rhode Island.

Reed is co-sponsoring bipartisan legislation to halt arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, mandate sanctions for Khashoggi's killers, and bar U.S.
refueling of Saudi-led coalition aircraft engaged in the Yemen civil
war, among other oversight measures related to the conflict there.

Another co-sponsor, Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed
Services Committee member Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H, offered her own rebuke
of Trump's letter.

"President Trump's habit of siding with murderous foreign dictators over
American intelligence professionals is a stain on our democracy that
undermines the American ideal," Shaheen said in a statement.
"Fortunately, the President is not the sole protector of that ideal.
Congress must now stand up with bipartisan resolve to condemn the brutal
slaying of Jamal Khashoggi and pass legislation to respond to this and
other Saudi crimes."

While it's unclear whether that bill will see a vote, Sen. Bernie
Sanders, I-Vt., said he expects his war powers resolution --- meant to
compel an end to U.S. involvement in the Yemen war --- to come to a vote
after Thanksgiving.

Economic benefits

A new report by the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based
think tank, argues that U.S. arms sales Trump touts in the letter amount
to \$14.5 billion and fewer than 20,000 U.S. jobs per year. The
president is getting it backwards, and the U.S. role as Saudi Arabia's
weapons supplier gives the U.S. strong leverage over Riyadh, according
to the report's author, William Hartung, director of the think tank's
Arms and Security Project.

"The Saudi military depends on U.S. arms, spare parts and maintenance to
carry out its brutal war in Yemen, and could not prosecute that war for
long without that support," Hartung said.

Two-thirds of the 365 combat-capable aircraft in the Saudi arsenal are
of American-origin, including 171 F-15 combat aircraft, a mainstay of
the Saudi air war in Yemen. The Saudi land forces and National Guard
possess more than 3,000 U.S.-supplied armored vehicles, and the Saudis
have tens of thousands of U.S.-supplied bombs and missiles.

That's why a competitor could not easily replace the U.S. in supplying
Riyadh, according to Hartung.

"It would take decades for the Kingdom to wean itself from dependence on
U.S. equipment, training and support, and new equipment might not be
easily interoperable with U.S.-supplied systems," Hartung said. "Saudi
Arabia could buy a Russian or Chinese system here or there to send a
political message, but they could not easily replace the role of sales
and support from the United States, along with the United Kingdom, as
the major bulwarks of its military capability."

Though Trump has claimed U.S.-Saudi arms deals account for 40,000 jobs,
Hartung reckons that because there are \$2.5 billion in annual arms
deliveries to Saudi Arabia, only 17,500 jobs would have been created in
any given year. Still, that's equal to less than three one-hundredths of
1 percent of the total U.S. labor force of more than 160 million people.

To boot, many of the jobs will be created in Saudi Arabia as part of its
new economic plan, which calls for 50 percent of the value of Saudi arms
purchases to be produced in the kingdom by 2030.

[A key part of Trump's rationale is that Iran was responsible for the
war in Yemen, attempting to destabilize Iraq, supporting Hezbollah and
propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad. Saudi Arabia would leave
Yemen if Iran does, he argued.]{.underline}

Since 2015, the Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been
fighting the Iran-backed Houthis, who took over Yemen's capital, Sanaa,
have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia and have targeted
vessels in the Red Sea.

"Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent
people throughout the Middle East," the letter reads. "Iran states
openly, and with great force, 'Death to America!' and 'Death to Israel!'
Iran is considered 'the world's leading sponsor of terror.' "

[The Pentagon's]{.underline} **[top uniformed officer]{.underline}**
[was asked at a public forum Saturday to provide a military
perspective]{.underline} on the impact of a freeze of U.S. arms sales to
Riyadh. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. [Joe Dunford said Saudi Arabia has
been and is now "an important partner for regional
security.\"]{.underline}

"[Their cooperation, interoperability and capability]{.underline}, if
you will, [would be a stabilizing force for the region, has been a
stabilizing force for the region,"]{.underline} Dunford said, [adding
that Saudi Arabia was one of America's partners in the Middle
East.]{.underline}

"Working forward," he said, "we will listen carefully to whatever the
policy is in light of recent events."

The House Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff,
D-Calif., on Tuesday fired back at Trump's statement, calling for an end
to support for Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, suspending arms sales
to the kingdom "and diminish\[ing\] our reliance on Riyadh regarding
other matters in the region."

Schiff, the panel's presumptive chairman when Democrats assume control
of the House, previously said the committee will conduct a "deep dive"
examination of Saudi Arabia's conduct in the wake of the Khashoggi
murder.

"It is true that our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
not just its Crown Prince, and that must factor into our response,"
Schiff said in a statement.

"But to suggest 'maybe he did and maybe he didn't' or that we are
incapable of finding out the truth, or that knowing the truth our
silence can be bought with arms sales, undermines respect for the Office
of the Presidency, the credibility of our intelligence community and
America's standing as a champion of human rights."

stability"
<https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/pompeo-us-saudi-partnership-key-to-regional-stability-1.1547367278366>

Dubai: [Washington's relationship with Saudi Arabia is "fundamental to
the stability and security of the region]{.underline}," US Secretary of
State Mike [Pompeo]{.underline} [said]{.underline} on Saturday.

"[**The relationship must go forward**. We have to have good relations
with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and this administration intends to do
so,"]{.underline} Pompeo said in an interview with Al Arabiya.

[Pompeo]{.underline} [will meet with]{.underline} [Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammad bin Salman]{.underline} on Sunday and plans to address many
regional issues.

When asked if it was a partnership or a friendship with Saudi Arabia,
Pompeo told Al Arabiya: \"Call it what you will. They\'ve been great
partners in the missions that we have asked them to assist us with.

Stability

He added: "[This relationship, this mutually beneficial relationship to
create stability in the Middle East --- and to assist the US in
executing things that keep the American people safe --- is very
important. And I\'m convinced the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a
great ally in doing so.\"]{.underline}

Pompeo arrived in Abu Dhabi over the weekend, one of the stops on his
nine-nation tour of Middle East, and his travels will continue on Sunday
with stops in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

He will wrap the tour up on Monday and Tuesday in Oman and Kuwait.

Pompeo\'s Middle east touris aimed at reassuring America\'s partners
that withdrawing troops from Syria does not mean Washington is
abandoning the region.

Pompeo has traveled to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates where he
called for increasing pressure on Iran and push for unity among Gulf
neighbours still embroiled in a festering dispute with Qatar.

**[Trump was right to veto the resolution]{.underline}**. As the
president mentioned in his statement, [American involvement]{.underline}
with the coalition [is limited to logistical support---which includes
identifying nonmilitary and civilian facilities for coalition aircraft
to avoid]{.underline}. Tragically, [this]{.underline} support [has not
avoided all civilian casualties]{.underline}, **[but it certainly has
reduced them]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [the Pentagon]{.underline}
[ended]{.underline} [its most direct military]{.underline}
[involvement]{.underline}---in-flight refueling of Saudi aircraft---last
year, in the aftermath of Khashoggi\'s murder. So [the
argument]{.underline} that [the United States is supporting a
belligerent]{.underline} [Saudi war machine is **not really
accurate**]{.underline}. Moreover, recall that [Saudi Arabia
launched]{.underline} [its military campaign]{.underline} [during the
Obama administration]{.underline}, at a time [when]{.underline}
[Riyadh]{.underline} **[felt it had to go rogue]{.underline}** [because
the]{.underline} **[United States was an unreliable ally]{.underline}**.
The fact is **[ending American support]{.underline}** for the coalition
**[will]{.underline}**, if anything, **[cause the Saudis to be more
reckless]{.underline}**, [not less]{.underline}. Journalists and
politicians fail to understand this basic point: [allies are more likely
to listen to Washington if they feel the United States supports
them]{.underline}, **[not if they feel abandoned and
pressured]{.underline}**. And [the United States has **more influence
when it is actively involved**]{.underline}, not sitting back and
watching events unfold from a distance.

The most disturbing part about [this congressional effort
is]{.underline} the obvious motivation [simply to punish Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, even **[at the expense of American
interests]{.underline}**. Like it or not, **[Saudi Arabia is an
essential American ally]{.underline}**. [Riyadh]{.underline} [is an
important partner in counterterrorism]{.underline}, and a huge purchaser
of American arms sales. [The Saudis also are a necessary staple of the
global oil market]{.underline}, which affects what Americans pay at the
pump regardless of how much oil the United States exports. [Not to
mention that the Houthis (and Iran) would love control of the Bab
el-Mandeb Strait]{.underline}, [one of the world\'s busiest oil
highways]{.underline}. The [Houthis have threatened to disrupt
international shipping]{.underline} in this waterway, [with weapons
supplied by Iran]{.underline}.

Moreover, [few developments would be more catastrophic]{.underline} for
the Middle East [than the collapse of the House of Saud]{.underline}.
[As chaotic as the Middle East is, the]{.underline} [Saudi government\'s
stability is one of the few threads keeping the region from reaching a
deeper circle of hell]{.underline}. [Allowing the Houthis to fire
missiles at Riyadh]{.underline} [and pose a **constant
threat**]{.underline} on Saudi Arabia\'s southern border [risks
destabilizing a key pillar of American interests]{.underline} in the
Middle East. Khashoggi\'s murder was heinous, and the administration\'s
moves to end the in-flight refueling and to impose sanctions on Saudi
officials were warranted. But it would be the height of folly to blow up
the alliance.

Members of [Congress]{.underline} [should]{.underline} absolutely want
to end the humanitarian suffering in Yemen. Indeed, [the United States
should continue to support the United Nations\' efforts to end the
conflict]{.underline}. But **[abandoning Saudi Arabia would only
perpetuate the violence]{.underline}**. [Too often lost in
discussions]{.underline} about Yemen [is]{.underline} [the fact
that]{.underline} **[the Houthis\'s brutal and incompetent
governance]{.underline}** [has worsened the humanitarian
disaster]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} have [failed to repair
sanitation services]{.underline}, [worsening]{.underline}
[Yemen\'s]{.underline} [cholera epidemic,]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
have [confiscated food and medical aid]{.underline} from civilians to
support their fighters. [The Houthis have also used child
soldiers]{.underline} to field more fighters. [The Saudis have certainly
waged a clumsy and incompetent war]{.underline}, but too many critics
are ~~blinded~~ by their hate of Riyadh to see the Houthis for the
monsters that they are. And that does not include their anti-American,
anti-Western, and anti-Semitic ideology, which is all too evident in
their slogan: \"Death to America, death to Israel, curse upon the Jews,
victory to Islam!\" Perhaps self-righteous journalists and politicians
can find some time to criticize the Houthis, not just the Saudis.

In sum, the United States cannot lose sight of the key strategic
objective in Yemen: to prevent the creation of a southern Hezbollah,
which would enhance Iran\'s nefarious influence in the Middle East and
only perpetuate violence and suffering. That means continuing American
support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen, as hard a pill as that may be to
swallow.

### 2nc - AT -- Extended Deterrence

Taking into consideration the potential for Egypt and Saudi Arabia to
proliferate, could the United States assure Cairo and Riyadh, dissuading
them from building their own nuclear weapons, by extending the U.S.
nuclear umbrella? [[Assurance gained through]{.underline}]{.mark} a
reasonably sound [[extended deterrence]{.mark} policy [relies on two
primary factors: capability and credibility. Although the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline} [a]{.mark}rguably [[possesses the physical
capability to deter the Iranian regime]{.underline}]{.mark} on behalf of
Gulf/Near Eastern states, [[whether it has sufficient political
credibility needed to assure its regional allies is not clear. Without
this credibility, states in the region may yet be tempted to acquire
their own nuclear guarantee]{.underline}]{.mark}.What does it mean to be
credible? Essentially, [[allies must be confident that the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would defend
them]{.underline}]{.mark} and their interests [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
the event of [[an act of aggression. This involves an unambiguous
obligation]{.mark},]{.underline} created through physical presence and
[[underpinned by political commitment]{.mark},]{.underline} to the
survival of these states and their regimes. Yet, as Cold War experience
taught, [[establishing credibility can be difficult.

Some have suggested that [[Saudi Arabia could]{.mark} clandestinely
**[purchase nuclear material]{.mark}**, **[nuclear technology]{.mark}**,
[or]{.mark} even **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}** [from Pakistan to ensure a
**quick breakout**]{.mark}]{.underline} if it faced an imminent threat
from Iran. [This may well be a possibility, but [would Saudi leaders
bet]{.mark} their national [security]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[Pakistan]{.mark}'s willingness [to accelerate its]{.mark} nuclear
[program?]{.mark}]{.underline} If Saudi Arabia and Iran entered a
serious confrontation, Tehran could well see such a move as one step
short of a declaration of war by Pakistan. Would Islamabad take that
risk?

[[Others]{.mark} might [argue that the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[could short-circuit]{.mark} an independent [Saudi nuclear

[its own nuclear umbrella]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[this]{.mark} policy [could]{.mark}
likewise [succeed **only**]{.mark} [if]{.mark} top [Saudi leaders
**believed**]{.mark} **that [the US commitment would be
reliable]{.mark}** in a crisis]{.underline}---and if they believed that
Iran's government thought so too. Given the rather mixed attitudes
toward Saudi Arabia in Congress and among the American public, the
debate inside the United States before and after an announcement like
this would likely do little to reassure Saudi officials.

### 2nc -- virtual prolif impact

Yet [the Saudis are]{.underline} often far more [subtle]{.underline} and
creative than others give them credit for. Even if Iran were to acquire
an actual weapon or a near-term breakout capability, the Saudis might
not simply take the obvious path forward and buy a nuclear weapon
itself. [There are many ways]{.underline} that [[the Saudis could take
actions that would create ambiguity and make Iran]{.mark} (and others)
[wonder whether the Saudis had acquired a nuclear capability]{.mark}
without declaring that the Kingdom had joined the nuclear club. [Riyadh
could build a nuclear plant]{.mark}]{.underline} of its own

uranium]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps even [[hiring]{.underline}]{.mark}
large numbers of [[Pakistanis]{.underline}]{.mark} and other foreigners
[[to do so very quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}, in almost exactly the same
manner that the Iranians have proceeded. A favorite Israeli scenario is
that [[one day, satellite imagery]{.mark} of Saudi Arabia suddenly
[reveals]{.mark} the presence of a half-dozen [nuclear-capable]{.mark}
Pakistani [F-16s]{.mark} at a Saudi air base. [Pakistan has long
contributed military support]{.mark}, equipment and even whole
formations to Saudi defense, [so this would not be anything
extraordinary]{.mark}. Everyone would wonder whether the F-16s had
brought nuclear weapons with them and the Saudis could studiously avoid
answering]{.underline} the question. [The Iranians, and the whole world,
would not know. There would be no proof]{.underline} that the Kingdom
had acquired a nuclear weapon and therefore no particular basis to
impose sanctions on Riyadh. [Yet [overnight, the Iranians would]{.mark}
have to [calculate]{.mark} that [the Kingdom]{.mark} had [acquired a
nuclear weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it would be very difficult for
anyone to punish the Saudis because there would be no evidence that they
had.

What, then, does this all mean for the non-proliferation regime? [[Iran

[[Nuclear hedging could prove an attractive option]{.mark} for states
seeking]{.underline} at least some of [the deterrent]{.underline} and
coercive [benefits that nuclear weapons can bring]{.underline}. Although
clearly not able to provide the same military, political or symbolic
power as the actual possession of nuclear weapons, hedging does have
some value in this regard. Indeed, the case of Saudi Arabia illustrates
that some countries may already be following a similar path to Iran.
[[In a regional context like the Middle East, the emergence of]{.mark}
two or more [nuclear hedgers could]{.mark} begin to [undermine the
credibility]{.mark} and legitimacy [of the NPT as a bulwark against
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}, not least because it could prove
difficult to contain 'hedgers' at low levels of latency. Moreover, [the
[strategic uncertainty that such hedging may engender could]{.mark}
potentially [provoke a **dangerous spiral** whereby states would]{.mark}

#### Causes pre-emptive strikes

Nuclear Weapons", NIDS Journal of Defense and Security, 13, Dec. 2012,
<http://www.nids.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2012/bulletin_e2012_3.pdf>)

As noted, a variety of approaches have been argued with regard to the
deterrence inherent in the¶ concept of virtual nuclear arsenals.
However, it should be noted once again that the concept's¶ "weaponless
deterrence" dimension has drawn fierce criticisms from supporters of
nuclear¶ deterrence and strategy scholars. In particular, the criticism,
which is along the same lines of the¶ criticism of minimum deterrence,46
i.e., that the concept of [virtual nuclear arsenals lacks
credibility]{.underline} about the use of nuclear weapons---a major
premise of the concept---[and cannot constitute an effective nuclear
deterrence]{.underline},47 must be considered. Kenneth
[[Waltz]{.underline}]{.mark} says he cannot support the¶ concept of
virtual nuclear arsenals. He [[reasons that virtual nuclear arsenals are
equivalent to deterrence without second strike capability]{.mark}, [and
notes the unstableness inherent in the system of virtual]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenals,]{.mark} i.e., the dangers of deterring by mutual monitoring
and competitive reconstruction of nuclear arsenals.]{.underline}48 Colin
Gray makes the case that it is difficult to conceive that¶ nuclear
deterrence would be realized, arguing that: the concept of virtual
nuclear arsenals will¶ likely lead to an end result that is
disproportionate to today's power distribution for the five nuclear¶
weapon states and other de-facto nuclear weapon states; the delayed
response that is a given¶ condition of the mechanism of reconstructing
nuclear arsenals will favor non-compliant states¶ both politically and
militarily; and no state would deem that a state is a "nuclear weapon
state"¶ because it retained nuclear weapons which are actually
non-operational.49 According to Michael¶ Wheeler, [[dismantled nuclear
arsenals are more vulnerable to attacks]{.mark} than nuclear arsenals
that are operationally deployed]{.underline}; hence, it is difficult to
deem them as an effective deterrent. Wheeler also¶ criticizes that
considering that even in today's world, the building and maintenance of
nuclear¶ arsenals requires specialized, large-scale infrastructure,
including means of delivery of nuclear¶ warheads, targeting systems,
reconnaissance systems, communications systems, procurement¶ systems,
and logistics support systems, the reconstruction of nuclear arsenals
under a virtual¶ nuclear arsenal regime is equivalent to developing
nuclear arsenals from scratch and will prove to¶ be futile.50 George
Perkovich and James Acton et al. contend that the [monitoring and
[inspection]{.mark} of dismantled nuclear arsenals [would
increase]{.mark} the [risks of inappropriate leakage of the storage
facilities' location, which would bring on a preemptive first
strike]{.mark} by the enemy [and]{.mark} accordingly [cause]{.mark} a
[destabilization of deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.51¶ As such, from
the perspective of the conventional theory of nuclear deterrence which
has¶ extended from the Cold War era, there is no way of getting around
saying that the concept of [[virtual nuclear arsenals is in an
extremely]{.underline}]{.mark} insufficient and [[unstable
situation]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand, however,¶ if the
concept of virtual nuclear arsenals is redefined as being in a
transition phase toward "a world¶ without nuclear weapons," perhaps it
would be possible to find subtle inter-linkages between the¶ theories of
deterrence and nuclear disarmament.

### 2nc prolif -- Global Prolif 

#### Saudi prolif spills over -- goes global

**Russell 5**

(Richard, Weapons Proliferation and War in the Greater Middle East:
Strategic Contest, p. 118)

The easing of a Saudi nuclear weapons program's opacity could occur
gradually over time -- after it is firmly established and protected from
potential preventive or preemptive strikes -- behind the scenes in
diplomatic exchanges and in subtle public references. The Saudis would
want to plant in the minds of potential rivals the suggestion that
Riyadh is not to be diplomatically and militarily intimidated or
coerced. Recent leaks to the media of unconfirmed reports of
Saudi-Pakistani nuclear cooperation, in fact, work toward this end. A
Saudi nuclear deterrent could more blatantly be revealed in the midst of
a future Gulf military crisis, perhaps one involving military posturing
by Iran against the Gulf states. Eithier way, public awareness of [[a
Saudi]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent will put t]{.mark}he West, and
particularly [the United States, in an awkward position. The United
States would lose]{.mark} some [prestige in light of a security partner
choosing a policy course in direct opposition to the American
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} to contain and stem the international
proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
Washington in the aftermath of revelations of a Saudi nuclear deterrent
would be under strong domestic and international pressure to take
measures to show its displeasure with Riyadh. The United States,
however, must avoid steps that would completely rupture American-Saudi
security ties: both Washington and Riyadh share the grand strategic
interest of seeing that no one power ever grows to dominate the Gulf.
[[The United States needs to recognize that Saudi Arabia will continue
to be a major player in]{.mark} the regional [competition for
power]{.mark}]{.underline} in the greater Middle East region. More
broadly, the recognition of [[a Saudi nuclear deterrent would be a major
blow against international proliferation regimes. The global community
would be forced to see that despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the best of
intentions and [[efforts, the "nuclear genie" will not be put back into
its bottle]{.underline}]{.mark} The West and the United States will have
to face the fact that weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
will be an ever-present reality of the post-11 September world.
[[Despite]{.mark} the [arguments]{.mark} from some quarters that the
proliferation of nuclear weapons will enhance international security
[by]{.mark} bolstering [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} and lessening
the chances for inter-state war, [[prudent statecraft would assume that
deterrence in practice is unlikely to be as effective as envisioned in
theory]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2nc relations - Laundry List

#### US-Saudi relations are key to stop terrorism, contain Iran, and maintain stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan

**LeVine '11** (Steve, author of The Oil and the Glory and a blogger on
energy issues at ForeignPolicy.com, Jan/Feb, Foreign Policy, "FRENEMIES
FOREVER" proquest)

Besides, Saudi Arabia isn\'t just a giant gas station with a flag.
[[Saudi help is now essential for numerous top-shelf U.S. priorities,
from containing Iran to countering terrorism to extricating U.S. troops
from Afghanistan and keeping Pakistan stable. Only Saudi Arabia, with
its carefully cultivated, behind-the-scenes links to countries and
leaders who do not trust Washington, can play this
role]{.underline}]{.mark}. In some ways, what we\'re seeing is just a
revival of old ties. For nearly five decades after President Franklin D.
Roosevelt met King Abdul Aziz aboard a U.S. destroyer in the Suez Canal
in 1945, the relationship pivoted on oil, but also on a mutual distrust
of the Soviet Union. When the Soviet empire broke up in 1991, that logic
fell apart too, and the alliance struggled for a new rationale, fitfully
working together to contain Iraq and Iran, the region\'s chief
troublemakers, but finding few other shared interests. Cooperation
against terrorism languished. Saudi royals funneled money to militants
in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and the former Yugoslavia. Across the
Muslim world and in mosques in Europe and the United States, Saudibacked
Wahhabi madrasas preached anti-American vitriol. U.S. officials
investigating the 1996 Khobar Towers attack, in which 19 Americans were
killed, complained of being stonewalled by their Saudi counterparts. And
we all know where Osama bin Laden grew up. September 11 marked a
breaking point. U.S. public opinion turned sharply against the kingdom
because of the large number of Saudi terrorists involved in the attack,
and members of President George W. Bush\'s administration bristled at
the lack of investigative cooperation from Riyadh. Meanwhile, the Saudis
tired of Washington taking them for granted as allies. The final straw
for Riyadh was fury at Bush\'s perceived coddling of Israel and inaction
in the face of Palestinian deaths. By the summer of 2002, a distinct
chill had set in. Then, in 2003 and 2004, the two countries were brought
together again after al Qaeda\'s Saudi branch launched a series of
attacks on oil installations, government facilities, and foreign
compounds in Riyadh and other cities - an audacious attempt to deepen
the split between the royal family and the United States. After a
bruising crackdown that included gun battles in the streets, Saudi
security forces eventually triumphed, and the remnants of the militants
fled south to Yemen. The Saudis poured money and security help into
Yemen, with which the kingdom shares a 930-mile border. So did the
United States. But Yemen struggled to deal with an influx of
battle-hardened radicals from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and elsewhere.
The wake-up call came in August 2009, when an al Qaeda suicide bomber
tried to kill the Saudi counterterrorism chief. Prince Mohammed bin
Nayef. Prince Nayef then had his agents infiltrate Yemeni tribes that
protect the militants, a turning point that helped uncover the details
of an October 2010 bomb plot, when al Qaeda\'s Yemen branch attempted to
send explosive packages through FedEx and ups to the United States.
Without Saudi Arabia\'s insistent calls to the cía, U.S. officials
concede, there is almost certainly no chance the bombs would have been
detected. Beyond al Qaeda, the United States and Saudi Arabia share a
host of common enemies, most notably the Saudis\' Persian Gulf rival
Iran. When the United States invaded Iraq and ousted Saddam Hussein in
2003, it also removed a Sunni shield against Iranian radicalism. U.S.
troops now fill that role, but ineffectively. Tehran has won much
influence within Iraq, and its sway over Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas
in Gaza is increasing. [Now, with U.S. forces gradually drawing down in
Iraq, Washington wants Saudi Arabia to carry a larger portion of the
burden. Riyadh appears more than happy to help America \"cut off the
head of the snake]{.underline},\" as the Saudi king was quoted saying in
a WikiLeaked cable. [In October, the State Department authorized the
largest arms sale in U.S. history]{.underline}, a \$60 billion Saudi
purchase of 154 new and upgraded F- 15 fighter jets, 190 helicopters,
advanced radar equipment, and satellite-guided bombs. [[Saudi diplomats
are]{.mark} also [playing an invaluable role in Afghanistan, Lebanon,
Pakistan, Palestine, and Syria, working to mediate between the various
warring factions and carrying private messages from Washington to U.S.
adversaries like Hamas and the Taliban]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Terrorism causes extinction 

**Toon et al 7** -- Owen B. Toon, chair of the Department of Atmospheric
and Oceanic Sciences at CU-Boulder, et al., April 19, 2007, "Atmospheric
effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts
and acts of individual nuclear terrorism," online:
<http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf>

To an increasing extent, people are congregating in the world's great
urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million
individuals. At the same time, advanced technology has designed nuclear
explosives of such small size they can be easily transported in a car,
small plane or boat to the heart of a city. We demonstrate here that
**[a single detonation in the 15 kiloton range can produce urban
fatalities approaching one million in some cases, and casualties
exceeding one million. Thousands of small weapons still exist in the
arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and there are at least six other
countries with substantial nuclear weapons inventories]{.underline}**.
In all, thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts of highly
enriched uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives. A conflict
between any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with yields of
15 kt has the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of the
Second World War. Moreover**[, even [a single]{.mark} surface [nuclear
explosion]{.mark}, or an air burst in rainy conditions, in a city center
is likely to cause the entire metropolitan area to be abandoned at least
for decades owing to infrastructure damage and radioactive
contamination]{.underline}**. As the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in
Louisiana suggests, **[the economic consequences of even a localized
nuclear catastrophe would most likely have severe national and
international economic consequences. Striking effects result even from
relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most
effective against city centers where business and social activity as
well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and terrorists would
be most likely to strike there.]{.underline}** Accordingly, **[an
organized attack on the U.S. [by]{.mark} a small nuclear state, or
[terrorists]{.mark} supported by such a state, [could generate
casualties comparable to those]{.mark} once predicted [for a full-scale
nuclear]{.mark} "counterforce" [exchange in a superpower
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Remarkably, **[the estimated quantities
of [smoke generated by attacks]{.mark} totaling about one megaton of
nuclear explosives [could lead to significant global climate
perturbations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Robock et al., 2007). While we did
not extend our casualty and damage predictions to include potential
medical, social or economic impacts following the initial explosions,
such analyses have been performed in the past for large-scale nuclear
war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson, 1985). Such a study should be
carried out as well for the present scenarios and physical outcomes.

The Saudis have already indicated privately---and WikiLeaks has done

his nuclear-proliferation ring was at its most active,
[[invite]{.mark}]{.underline} what Edelman guardedly calls

evidence" to suggest that an agreement of some sort might already exist
between the two countries. Where Edelman goes an important stage further

("Nuclear War: Consequences of Regional-Scale Nuclear Conflicts",
Science 2 March 2007, vol. 315 no. 5816, pp. 1224-1225)

Nuclear arsenals containing 50 or more weapons of low yield \[15
kilotons (kt), equivalent to the Hiroshima bomb\] are relatively easy to
build (1, 6). [[India and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, the smallest
nuclear powers, probably [h[ave such arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline},
although no nuclear state has ever disclosed its inventory of warheads
(7). Modern weapons are compact and lightweight and are readily
transported (by car, truck, missile, plane, or boat) (8). The basic
concepts of weapons design can be found on of the Internet. The only
serious obstacle to constructing a bomb is the limited availability of
purified fissionable fuels. ¶ There are many political, economic, and
social factors that could trigger a regional scale nuclear conflict,
plus many scenarios for the conduct of the ensuing war. We assumed (4)
that the densest population centers in each country---usually in
megacities---are attacked. We did not evaluate specific military targets
and related casualties. [[We considered a nuclear exchange]{.mark}
involving 100 weapons]{.underline} of 15-kt yield each, that is, \~0.3%
of the total number of existing weapons (4). [[India and
Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[have previously tested
nuclear weapons]{.mark} and [are now thought to have]{.mark} between 109
and 172 [weapons]{.mark} of unknown yield]{.underline} (9). ¶ Fatalities
were estimated by means of a standard population database for a number
of countries that might be targeted in a regional conflict (see figure,
above). For instance, such an exchange between India and Pakistan (10)
could produce about 21 million fatalities---about half as many as
occurred globally during World War II. The direct effects of thermal
radiation and nuclear blasts, as well as gamma-ray and neutron radiation
within the first few minutes of the blast, would cause most casualties.
Extensive damage to infrastructure, contamination by long-lived
radionuclides, and psychological trauma would likely result in the
indefinite abandonment of large areas leading to severe economic and
social repercussions. ¶ [[Fires ignited]{.mark} by nuclear bursts [would
release]{.mark} copious amounts of light-absorbing [smoke]{.mark} into
the upper atmosphere]{.underline}. If [100small nuclear
weapons]{.underline} were detonated within cities, they [could generate
1 to 5 million tons of]{.underline} carbonaceous [smoke]{.underline}
particles (4), darkening the sky and affecting the atmosphere more than
major volcanic eruptions like Mt. Pinatubo (1991) or Tambora (1815) (5).
Carbonaceous smoke particles are transported by winds throughout the
atmosphere but also induce circulations in response to solar heating.
Simulations (5) predict that such radiative dynamical interactions would
loft and stabilize the smoke aerosol, which would allow it to persist in
the middle and upper atmosphere for a decade. Smoke [[emissions]{.mark}
of 100 low yield urban explosions [in a regional]{.mark} nuclear
[conflict would generate]{.mark} **substantial [global scale climate
anomalies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although not as large as in previous
"nuclear winter" scenarios for a full-scale war (11, 12). However,
indirect effects on surface land temperatures, precipitation rates, and
growing season lengths (see figure, page 1225) would be likely to
degrade agricultural productivity to an extent that historically has led
to famines in Africa, India, and Japan after the 1783--1784 Laki
eruption (13) or in the northeastern United States and Europe after the
Tambora eruption of 1815 (5). Climatic anomalies could persist for a
decade or more because of smoke stabilization, far longer than in
previous nuclear winter calculations or after volcanic eruptions. ¶
Studies of the consequences of full-scale nuclear war show that
[indirect effects of the war could cause more casualties than direct
ones, perhaps **eliminating the majority of the world's
population**]{.underline} (11, 12). Indirect effects such as damage to
transportation, energy, medical, political, and social infrastructure
could be limited to the combatant nations in a regional war. However,
[climate anomalies would threaten the world]{.underline} outside the
combat zone. The predicted smoke emissions and fatalities per kiloton of
explosive yield are roughly 100 times those expected from estimates for
full-scale nuclear attacks with high-yield weapons (4).

### 2nc impact -- East Asian allied prolif 

#### The plan [decks]{.underline} US credibility in Asia\-\--perception of abandoning Saudi Arabia spills over\-\--causes Japanese and South Korean prolif 

Amitai **Etzioni 14**, professor of international relations at The
George Washington University, former senior adviser to the Carter White
House, "Near East and Far East: Not So Distant," 3/3/14,
<http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/near-east-and-far-east-not-so-distant/>

[Actually, there is a **profound link** between the two theaters: namely
whatever takes place in the Middle East greatly affects what takes place
in]{.underline} Southeast and [East Asia]{.underline}. [The more the
United States turns out to be a fickle, unreliable ally of its
longstanding friends in the Middle East---especially **Saudi
Arabia**]{.underline} and Israel---[the more the leaders of South Korea
and Japan will worry whether they can rely on the United States' defense
umbrella]{.underline}. Similarly, the more Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain
must worry about the backing of the U.S.---the more Vietnam and the
Philippines are likely to worry about being trampled as the elephant and
tiger rumble.¶ Israel would not have been born without the United
States' support. Since 1948, a succession of American presidents, a wide
array of public leaders from both parties, and the media have treated
Israel as a close and critical ally of the United States. The House
Foreign Affairs Committee recently approved a bill that would designate
Israel a "major strategic ally," a label afforded to no other country.
In a speech to "the people of Israel" in March 2013, President Barack
Obama stated that "the security relationship between the United States
and Israel has never been stronger."¶ However, mistrust of the U.S. is
now widespread in Israel. Many believe that Obama and large portions of
the American public are keen to avoid any new entanglements in the
Middle East, come what may. Many Israelis fear that the deal that is now
being negotiated with Iran will lead to the breakdown of the sanction
regime; that Iran will continued its clandestine development of nuclear
arms; and that it will dash to assemble a handful of nuclear weapons
just as the Obama administration is packing to leave. Indeed, the
Israelis cannot help but note that many American observers, including
some highly regarded ones, already argue that the United States could
contain a nuclear Iran just as it contained the U.S.SR and that doing so
is a better option than starting a war to avoid an Iranian nuclear
bomb.¶ Saudi Arabia has been celebrated for decades as an important
United States ally---as a scholar at the Middle East Institute put it,
it is "vital to the strategic and economic interests of the United
States." Although it may seem odd at first blush, the Saudis feel even
more abandoned and beleaguered than Israel. Israel has nuclear arms and
a strong military of its own to deter Iran; Saudi Arabia has a
relatively weak and inexperienced military and no nuclear weapons.
Moreover, the Saudi regime is challenged from within, as are all
authoritarian regimes in the region; Israel does not face this issue.
The Saudis also witness, with great dismay, that the United States not
only acquiesced to rise of the Muslim Brotherhood but in effect helped
to oust President Hosni Mubarak---whose regime the Saudis note was
similar to their own. Moreover, as Iran gains ground in Iraq,
strengthens its foothold in Lebanon, supports fighting in Syria, and
increases its influence in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia sees itself as
engaged in a mortal fight between Sunnis and Shias---with the Sunnis on
the weaker side. And they hear American voices increasingly arguing that
given the development of new forms and sources of energy, the whole
Middle East is losing its importance to the United States.¶ **[Much
depends on what happens next]{.underline}**. The United States may well
be forced to re-pivot back to the Middle East; a major terrorist attack
on U.S. soil originating in the region may well have such an effect. The
same holds true if Pakistan's government collapses or other reasons
emerge to fear the Taliban's acquisition of nuclear weapons. Disruptions
to the flow of oil could force the U.S. to act, if only because its
European allies and the already fragile global economy would suffer
greatly otherwise. The collapse of Jordan's regime or a victory of
forces allied with Iran in Syria might also precipitate U.S. action.
However, [if the United States]{.underline} continues to in effect
[disengage from the Middle East]{.underline}, tolerate the rising
influence of Iran in the region, [and appear to abandon]{.underline}
Israel and [Saudi Arabia---Japan and South Korea cannot help but take
notice and act in response]{.underline}.¶ [Much depends on how history
next unfolds in the Middle East]{.underline} (recognizing that the
world's attention is for the time being focused on Crimea). If Iran
abides by an agreement to limit its nuclear program to peaceful
purposes, the Lebanese army countervails Hezbollah, the Syrian conflict
ends with a partition or coalition government, and Jordan holds---[the
Near East challenge to U.S. credibility may remain limited. However, if
these events unfold in ways that now many suspect, leaving little doubt
that nations better fend for themselves than trust the U.S. to protect
them---Japan is likely to move more expeditiously to arm itself, not
just "reinterpreting" but revising its pacifist
constitution]{.underline}. Nor can one disregard that [if Japan chose to
become a nuclear power, it could do so in a short order given that it
has very sizable stores of plutonium]{.underline}. At the same time,
South Korea is likely to further extend its current trend of following
its own agenda rather than closely dovetailing it with U.S. positions.¶
In short[, whatever happens in the Near East next will have significant
consequences in the Far East]{.underline}. [There are two realms but
only one U.S.A. Its weakness---and challenged credibility---in one
theater is likely to have significant repercussions in the
other.]{.underline}

Many analysts---not only in Washington---fear that [[failing to reassure
Gulf allies]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[lead]{.underline} [them to look
for alternative]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic options to ensure their
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite its very limited capabilities
in the nuclear field, [[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} often tops the
list of three or four countries which [[could "go
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}" if and [when Iran does]{.underline}. As a
second-best option, [[Saudi Arabia could ask
Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, a country with which it has had a very
close relationship for decades, [[to give]{.mark} it [a]{.mark} [nuclear
guarantee]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such [a guarantee could]{.underline}
even [be entrenched [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the presence of
[[Pakistani]{.mark} nuclear [weapons on Saudi soil]{.mark}]{.underline}
but remaining under Islamabad's control, thus mimicking the NATO
"nuclear sharing" arrangements. Pakistan could consider that such an
arrangement would have advantages in terms of the survivability of its
arsenal: [weapons]{.underline} stationed [in the Arabian Peninsula would
pose a major]{.underline} political and operational [challenge for
New-Delhi and]{.underline} probably [negate its preemptive strike
options]{.underline}. While Islamabad and Riyad both have friendly
relations with the West, such a radical change in the nuclear picture
may have unforeseen and unwanted consequences.

#### Saudi-Pakistan nuclear co-op causes nuclear war

There is, however, at least one state that could receive significant
outside support: Saudi Arabia. And if it did, proliferation could
accelerate throughout the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been
geopolitical and ideological rivals. Riyadh would face tremendous
pressure to respond in some form to a nuclear-armed Iran, not only to
deter Iranian coercion and subversion but also to preserve its sense
that Saudi Arabia is the leading nation in the Muslim world. [The Saudi
government is already pursuing a nuclear power capability]{.underline},
which could be the first step along a slow road to nuclear weapons
development. And concerns persist [that it might be able to accelerate
its progress by exploiting its close ties to Pakistan]{.underline}.
During the 1980s, in response to the use of missiles during the IranIraq
War and their growing proliferation throughout the region, Saudi Arabia
acquired several dozen CSS-2 intermediate-range ballistic missiles from
China. The Pakistani government reportedly brokered the deal, and it may
have also offered to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear warheads for the CSS-2s,
which are not accurate enough to deliver conventional warheads
effectively. There are still rumors that Riyadh and Islamabad have had
discussions involving nuclear weapons, nuclear technology, or security
guarantees. This \"Islamabad option\" could develop in one of several
different ways. [[Pakistan could sell]{.mark} operational [nuclear
weapons]{.mark} and delivery systems to Saudi Arabia, [or]{.mark} it
could [provide]{.mark} the Saudis with the [infrastructure, material,
and]{.mark} technical [support they need]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}to produce nuclear weapons themselves within a matter of years,
as opposed to a decade or longer. Not only has Pakistan provided such
support in the past, but it is currently building two more heavy-water
reactors for plutonium production and a second chemical reprocessing
facility to extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. In other words,
it might accumulate more fissile material than it needs to maintain even
a substantially expanded arsenal of its own. Alternatively, [[Pakistan
might]{.mark} offer an extended deterrent guarantee to Saudi Arabia and
[deploy nuclear weapons,]{.mark} delivery systems, and troops [on Saudi
territory]{.mark}]{.underline}, a practice that the United States has
employed for decades with its allies. This arrangement could be
particularly appealing to both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. It would allow
the Saudis to argue that they are not violating the NPT since they would
not be acquiring their own nuclear weapons. And an extended deterrent
from Pakistan might be preferable to one from the United States because
stationing foreign Muslim forces on Saudi territory would not trigger
the kind of popular opposition that would accompany the deployment of
U.S. troops. Pakistan, for its part, would gain financial benefits and
international clout by deploying nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia, as
well as strategic depth against its chief rival, India. The Islamabad
option raises a host of difficult issues, perhaps the most worrisome
being how [[India]{.mark} would respond. [Would]{.mark} it [target
Pakistan\'s weapons in Saudi Arabia with its own]{.mark} conventional or
[nuclear weapons? How would this expanded nuclear competition influence
stability during a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} in either the Middle East
or South Asia? Regardless of India\'s reaction, [any decision by the
Saudi government to seek out nuclear weapons, by whatever means, would
be highly destabilizing. It would increase the incentives of other
nations in the Middle East to pursue nuclear weapons]{.underline} of
their own. And it could increase their ability to do so by eroding the
remaining barriers to nuclear proliferation: each additional state that
acquires nuclear weapons weakens the nonproliferation regime, even if
its particular method of acquisition only circumvents, rather than
violates, the NPT. N-PLAYER COMPETITION Were Saudi Arabia to acquire
nuclear weapons, the Middle East would count three nuclear-armed states,
and perhaps more before long. It is unclear how such an n-player
competition would unfold because most analyses of nuclear deterrence are
based on the U.S.-Soviet rivalry during the Cold War. It seems likely,
however, that the interaction among three or more nuclear-armed powers
would be more prone to miscalculation and escalation than a bipolar
competition. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union
only needed to concern themselves with an attack from the other.
Multipolar systems are generally considered to be less stable than
bipolar systems because coalitions can shift quickly, upsetting the
balance of power and creating incentives for an attack. More important,
[[emerging nuclear powers]{.mark} in the Middle East [might not
take]{.mark} the costly [steps necessary to preserve regional stability
and avoid a nuclear exchange.]{.mark}]{.underline} For nuclear-armed
states, the bedrock of deterrence is the knowledge that each side has a
secure second-strike capability, so that no state can launch an attack
with the expectation that it can wipe out its opponents\' forces and
avoid a devastating retaliation. However, emerging nuclear powers might
not invest in expensive but survivable capabilities such as hardened
missile silos or submarine-based nuclear forces. Given this likely
vulnerability, the close proximity of states in the Middle East, and the
very short flight times of ballistic missiles in the region, any [[new
nuclear powers might]{.mark} be compelled to [\"launch on
warning\"]{.mark}]{.underline} of an attack or even, during a crisis, to
use their nuclear forces preemptively. Their governments might also
delegate launch authority to lower-level commanders, heightening the
possibility of miscalculation and escalation. Moreover, if early warning
systems were not integrated into robust command-and-control systems, the
risk of an unauthorized or accidental launch would increase further
still. And without sophisticated early warning systems, [[a nuclear
attack might be]{.mark} unattributable or [attributed
incorrectly.]{.mark}]{.underline} That is, assuming that the leadership
of a targeted state survived a first strike, it might not be able to
accurately determine which nation was responsible. And this uncertainty,
when combined with the pressure to respond quickly, would create a
significant risk that [[it would retaliate against the wrong
party,]{.mark} potentially [triggering a]{.mark} regional [nuclear
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most existing nuclear powers have taken steps
to protect their nuclear weapons from unauthorized use: from closely
screening key personnel to developing technical safety measures, such as
permissive action links, which require special codes before the weapons
can be armed. Yet there is no guarantee that emerging nuclear powers
would be willing or able to implement these measures, creating a
significant risk that [[their governments might lose control
over]{.mark} the weapons or nuclear material and that [nonstate actors
could gain access]{.mark} t]{.underline}o these items. Some states might
seek to mitigate threats to their nuclear arsenals; for instance, they
might hide their weapons. In that case, however, a single intelligence
compromise could leave their weapons vulnerable to attack or theft.

nuclear weapon," 19 June 2014,
http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/middleeast/obaid-saudi-nuclear-weapon/)

(CNN) [Now that the Obama administration has largely given up its
resistance to Iran\'s development of some kind of nuclear program, [the
Middle East is poised to see a **change in the balance of
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Saudi Ambassador to the United
Kingdom recently stated, should Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, \"**[[all
options]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[could be on the table]{.mark} when it
comes [to the Saudi response]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That could [include
an **indigenous nuclear program**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And although
some commentators remain skeptical about [the]{.mark}
[Kingdom]{.mark}\'s ability to produce nuclear weapons, I would argue
that it actually **[has the will]{.mark}** **[and the ability]{.mark}**
to do so.]{.underline}

[[There are six]{.mark} core [components]{.mark} [that a country must
possess]{.mark} in order [to create a]{.mark} nuclear [program]{.mark}
[capable of being weaponized]{.mark}]{.underline}: [1) an adequate
[educational system]{.mark}]{.underline}, [2) skilled
[scientists]{.mark}, 3) [financial means]{.mark}, 4) technological
[infrastructure]{.mark}, 5) belief there is a pressing [security
threat]{.mark}, and 6) the [national will]{.mark} and leadership to do
so. **[Saudi Arabia possesses each]{.mark} of these**]{.underline}.

For a start, [the Saudi educational system]{.underline}, [especially in
the sciences]{.underline}, [has improved in recent years]{.underline},
and is undergoing changes that should see even greater progress.
Meanwhile, [the Kingdom\'s education budget has]{.underline} more than
[doubled]{.underline} since 2005, with more than \$350 billion spent on
education since then. Indeed, in 2014, spending on education and
training represented about a quarter of the governmental budget, and the
Saudi leadership has funded a massive foreign scholarship program that
has seen more than 200,000 Saudis studying abroad. As a result, [Saudi
Arabia is the third largest student \"exporter\" after China and
India]{.underline}.

In addition, [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [has]{.mark} had [nuclear
physicists]{.mark} [with PhD\'s]{.mark} from Harvard, MIT, Stanford and
other top U.S. universities [conducting]{.mark} **[advanced
research]{.mark} in nuclear physics**]{.underline} at the King Abdulaziz
City for Science and Technology (KACST) **[[for
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}** before the King Abdullah Atomic Energy
City (KACARE) was created and took over all nuclear matter. As detailed
in a 2011 KACARE white paper on the government\'s civil nuclear
strategy, a select committee of Saudi nuclear scientists has already
conducted groundbreaking research on an elaborate civil nuclear program.
With this in mind, as a Washington Institute for Near East Policy policy
brief notes, [plans are in place for the \"construction of sixteen
nuclear power reactors over the next twenty years]{.underline} at a cost
of about \$80 billion.\" King Salman is expected to give his final
blessing before the end of this year.

Depending on how the Iranian negotiations conclude, [the Saudi
leadership will form a similar select committee to draft a white paper
on a weaponized nuclear program]{.underline}. One of the underlying
fundamentals of Saudi nuclear strategy has been to have a program based
on indigenous technology to ensure that the entire fuel cycle remains
under Saudi control. In short, the country doesn\'t want to buy nuclear
weapons from countries like Pakistan.

[[The]{.mark} [current Saudi]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark} scientific
[community is **perfectly capable**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} mastering the
complexities of [such a program]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the end of
World War II, the technology associated with producing plutonium and
highly enriched uranium has become more efficient and has served as the
cornerstone of most civilian nuclear programs around the world.

[[Is there]{.mark} a widespread [belief that Saudi]{.mark} Arabia
[faces]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n impending national [security]{.mark}
[threat]{.mark}, which would motivate it to want to develop a nuclear
weapon?]{.underline} In short, **[[yes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Iran has
pursued an intrusive, insurrectionary policy in Arab countries with Shia
communities, some of them directly surrounding the Kingdom. A nuclear
Iran would be viewed as a direct threat to the Kingdom, and a response
of equal measure would be considered prudent, necessary and justified.

Finally, [the [required]{.mark} national [will and leadership]{.mark} to
create a nuclear program [is **clear**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**Saudi
[nationalism is on the rise]{.mark}** and the [Saudi people expect their
leaders to take a **strong stance**]{.mark} in these difficult
times]{.underline}. [The revitalized foreign and defense policy
doctrines being adopted by King Salman have brought a great deal of hope
to Arabs across the region]{.underline}. [The Saudi monarch is utilizing
his Kingdom\'s unique religious legitimacy and enormous political,
financial and military means to project sustained power and unify the
Arab world]{.underline}.

The thinking in Washington seems to be that Saudi Arabia should remain a
passive player in the Middle East, with even President Obama suggesting
the Kingdom should not develop a nuclear program. Instead, there is talk
of a \"nuclear umbrella\" that would supposedly safeguard Gulf states
including Saudi Arabia against a nuclear Iran. But this is completely
unacceptable to the Saudi leadership. As with any important nation with
global responsibilities, it is a matter of vital national security that
the Kingdom be able to defend itself and its allies from hostile outside
forces. A nuclear Iran is one such force. With the U.S. continuing to
move in the direction of allowing such a development, [the Kingdom can
only look to itself to protect its people, **[even if this means]{.mark}
implementing [a nuclear program]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And make no
mistake, [it has the **scientists**]{.mark} to develop the
**[technology]{.mark}**, **[finances]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} national
**[will]{.mark}** [to do so]{.mark}.]{.underline}

suit---and **[nothing will stop them]{.mark}**]{.underline}---because
they will not live in a world where Iran has a nuclear weapon and they
do not. Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former Saudi Intelligence Chief, has
gone so far as to repeat that warning in public.\[3\] For instance, in
2011, Turki commented that, "It is in our interest that
[Iran]{.underline} does not [develop a nuclear weapon]{.underline}, for
its [doing so would compel Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, whose foreign
relations are now so fully measured and well assessed, [to pursue
policies that could lead to]{.underline} untold and possibly **[dramatic
consequences]{.underline}**."\[4\]

#### Nuclearization itself causes war even if it's not successful.

**Guzansky '15** (7/22, Yoel, is a senior research fellow in the
Institute for National Security Studies, Tel Aviv University and former
Iran Coordinator in Israel's National Security Council. "Could the Iran
Deal Drive Saudi Arabia to Go Nuclear?",
http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.667189)

Current [Saudi policy is based on the presumption that its right to
enrich uranium should be recognized, as in Tehran\'s case]{.underline}.
Developing a nuclear program including the ability to enrich uranium
would be only a long-term option for Saudi Arabia, due to the kingdom\'s
current lack of knowledge and facilities. From Riyadh's point of view,
however, the agreement with Iran gives it 10 years of Iranian nuclear
restraint, and in this time, the kingdom will be able to choose from
various nuclear options permitted under the NPT.

In order to develop a civilian nuclear program, [[the kingdom]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} likely [seek to partner with]{.mark} countries including
[Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}, with which the kingdom has close defense
relations. Differences have emerged recently between Riyadh and
Islamabad regarding the war in Yemen, but [if Pakistan becomes convinced
that its ally -- which not only financed a large part of its nuclear
program but provides the country with significant economic aid -- needs
long-term assistance to build an enrichment facility, **[it would help,
even if unofficially]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Because the process of building independent nuclear capability is
prolonged]{.underline} and demanding, [the kingdom must find a
medium-term response]{.underline} to cope with the challenge posed by
Iran's nuclear status. One such possibility is that [[Saudi Arabia may
ask Pakistan to station its]{.mark} own nuclear [warheads on Saudi
territory]{.mark}]{.underline} as sort of an extended deterrent
arrangement, should Iran openly build a bomb. And **[[even if Saudi
Arabia's path to nuclear capability is not
guaranteed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[its **very presence**]{.mark} **in
the arms race** [is liable to]{.mark} set in motion various processes
with **[negative consequences for regional stability]{.mark}** in
general, and for Israel in particular]{.underline}.

#### Pakistan will give the Saudis nukes

**Henderson 2018**

March 08, 2018 Simon Henderson \| Director of the Gulf and Energy Policy
Program at the Washington Institute "Does Saudi Arabia Intend to Develop
a Nuclear Weapons Capability?" https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/75723

[Saudi Arabia probably already has a nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}, **[courtesy of Pakistan]{.underline}**. The
assumption is that [Pakistan's nuclear-tipped missiles could be sent to
the kingdom]{.underline}, either [to **boost Saudi
deterrence**]{.underline} [against]{.underline} [Iran]{.underline} or to
safeguard part of Pakistan's strategic force in time of crisis with
India, complicating New Delhi's options.

[The details of such a Saudi-Pakistani understanding]{.underline}---it
may not be a written agreement---**[are reconfirmed]{.underline}**
[every]{.underline} [time there is a **change of government** in
Pakistan]{.underline}, [or a change on the Saudi throne]{.underline}.
[Hence]{.underline} [the]{.underline} two [visits]{.underline} that
[Saudi defense minister]{.underline} (and [now crown
prince]{.underline}) Muhammad bin Salman [has made to Pakistan
since]{.underline} his father [King Salman]{.underline} [took
over]{.underline} the throne in 2015. [Hence, also,]{.underline} the
[regular]{.underline} [visits by Pakistan's military leadership to the
kingdom]{.underline}---on military and security policy any civilian
government in Islamabad takes a back seat.

#### They'll buy from North Korea

**Keck '15** (Zachary Keck is managing editor of The National Interest.
He was previously managing editor of The Diplomat, "The Ultimate
Nightmare: North Korea Could Sell Saudi Arabia Nuclear Weapons," 22 June
2015,
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-ultimate-nightmare-north-korea-could-sell-saudi-arabia-13162?page=2)

But while [[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} couldn't purchase a
nuclear weapon from Pakistan, it [[might have]{.mark} more [luck with
North Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [there are a number of
compelling reasons to believe [North Korea might be **amenable**
to]{.mark} such [a request]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Most obviously, [[North Korea has a]{.mark} troubling **[history of
proliferating]{.mark} [nuclear tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology,
[including **[to the Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There have
long been persistent]{.underline} (albeit largely unconfirmed) [rumors
that North Korea has provided Iran with nuclear technology, and
Pyongyang also helped Syria build a nuclear reactor]{.underline} (which
Israel destroyed in airstrikes in 2011). More generally, [[North Korea
has a]{.mark} long [track record of selling]{.mark}]{.underline}
[advanced [military]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [like
ballistic missiles to numerous pariah nations.]{.underline}

Moreover, [[Saudi Arabia would be an **extremely valuable
patron**]{.mark} [for North Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}. Currently, Kim
Jong-un is trying to improve the economy especially for North Korean
elites in order to shore up support for his rule. This effort has been
made extremely difficult by the more hardline stance China has taken
against North Korea ever since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012.

[Pyongyang has been scrambling to find suitable replacements for China,
but so far it has had little luck.]{.underline} [Russia appears to want
to improve ties with North Korea, but its growing financial woes will
limit its ability to provide North Korea with]{.underline} enough
[economic assistance]{.underline} to offset the loss of Chinese aid.
Meanwhile, [South Korea appears intent on limiting its economic
relationship with North]{.underline} [Korea]{.underline} absent
significant concessions from Pyongyang on the latter's nuclear program.

[[Saudi Arabia would face]{.mark} **[no]{.mark}ne of these
[constraints]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Unlike South Korea, [Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [is not]{.mark} overtly [threatened by North Korea's nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And unlike Russia, it does not face
enormous financial difficulties.]{.underline}

In fact, [[Saudi Arabia is **awash in
petrodollars**]{.underline}]{.mark}, boasting the third largest foreign
currency reserves in the world after only China and Japan. Although it
has been using these to soften the impact of lower oil prices, it still
has \$708 billion in FX reserves, more than enough to provide
significant support for North Korea.

[Saudi Arabia could also provide North Korea with other kinds of
**valuable assistance**]{.underline}. For instance, [foreign workers
make up over half of Saudi Arabia's labor force, and North Koreans
working in Saudi Arabia could provide the Hermit Kingdom with another
significant source of hard currency]{.underline}. Indeed, this is one of
the Kim regime's favorite tactics for skirting international sanctions.
As the Asan Institute of Policy Studies has explained: "Earnings are not
sent back as remittances, but appropriated by the state and transferred
back to the country in the form of bulk cash, in clear violation on UN
sanctions."

Some estimate that as many as 65,000 North Koreans are working abroad in
40 different countries, and that this number has doubled or even tripled
since Kim Jong-un took power. Yet, according to Asan, Saudi Arabia
doesn't even rank in the top ten nations in terms of North Korean
laborers. Changing that would be a huge boon to the Kim regime.

Finally, besides hard cash, [North [Korea faces a **chronic energy
shortage**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with China accounting for nearly 90
percent of North Korea's energy imports in recent years. [[Saudi
oil]{.mark} and natural gas [could significantly reduce]{.mark} North
Korea's [reliance on China]{.mark} for its energy needs, while also
helping to stimulate the North Korean economy.]{.underline}

### Yes prolif -- Iran Threat

#### Iran deal expiration creates the impetus for Saudi Prolif

**Burkhard et al 2017**

Arabia's Nuclear Ambitions and Proliferation Risks" INSTITUTE FOR
SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY March 30, 2017 -- Rev. 1
https://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/SaudiArabiaProliferationRisks_30Mar2017_Final.pdf

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has an uneasy relationship with Iran. The
Iran nuclear deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which
went into effect in January 2016, has limited Iran's sensitive nuclear
program and subjected it to greater international monitoring. [Many
hoped]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} [JCPOA]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} also [ease regional security tensions]{.underline}
[between Saudi Arabia and Iran,]{.underline} **[yet they have actually
increased]{.underline}** despite the deal. The [JCPOA]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} also [not eliminated the Kingdom's desire for nuclear
weapons capabilities]{.underline} and even nuclear weapons, [but rather
reduced the pressure]{.underline} on Saudi Arabia [to match Iran's
nuclear]{.underline} weapons [capabilities]{.underline} [in the short
term]{.underline}. In that sense, [the deal has delayed concerns about
nuclear proliferation in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. However, [there is
little reason to doubt]{.underline} that [Saudi Arabia will more
actively seek nuclear weapons capabilities]{.underline},
[motivated]{.underline} [by its concerns about the ending of the
JCPOA's]{.underline} major nuclear limitations starting after year 10 of
the deal or sooner if the deal fails. If Iran expands its enrichment
capabilities, as it states it will do, Tehran will reduce nuclear
breakout times, or the time needed to produce enough weapon-grade
uranium for a nuclear weapon, to weeks and then days. [With these
concerns, the Kingdom is likely to seek nuclear weapons capabilities as
a hedge]{.underline}. A priority of the administration of Donald J.
Trump is to prevent Saudi Arabia from developing such capabilities, in
particular acquiring reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities. The
administration's stated commitment to better enforce and strengthen the
JCPOA provides a sounder foundation to achieve that goal.

¶ Saudi Capability to Develop or Procure a Nuclear Weapon¶
Traditionally, Saudi Arabia has never had much potential to develop or
procure a nuclear weapon due to its lack of motivation and capability.
King Abdullah\'s 2009 vow and [Saudi Arabia\'s lack of
confidence]{.underline} in the temporary and reversible goals outlined
in the Joint Plan of Action [provides the kingdom with motivation to
explore several short-term and long-term avenues available
today]{.underline}, [due to stronger foreign relations with nuclear
states and a bolstered education program to obtain a nuclear insurance
policy]{.underline}.¶ [Saudi Arabia has a long-standing relationship
with nuclear-armed Pakistan and has made significant investments in the
Pakistani nuclear program over the years]{.underline}.¶ Gary Samore,
President Barack Obama\'s former counter-proliferation advisor,
speculated that [the Saudi investment in the Pakistani nuclear program
led \"the Saudis \[to\] believe that they have some understanding with
Pakistan that, in extremis, they would have claim to acquire nuclear
weapons from Pakistan]{.underline}.\"¶ Pakistan denies this charge,
claiming to be \"a responsible nuclear weapon state with robust command
and control structures and comprehensive export controls.\" [Though
Pakistan may officially have little incentive to either provide nuclear
weapons to Saudi Arabia or deploy them in Saudi territory, there exists
the possibility for unofficial leaks of know-how or material from the
Pakistani nuclear program to support a Saudi initiative]{.underline}.¶
Dr. Abdul Qadeer [Khan, who played a key role in the development of the
Pakistani nuclear program, was accused of selling nuclear secrets and
equipment to Libya and North Korea]{.underline}. He was subsequently
fired by the Pakistani government in 2004 and placed under house arrest
until February 2009. **[The large financial resources available to Saudi
Arabia allow access to this avenue of unofficial
procurement]{.underline}**.¶ [These underhanded attempts at
proliferation may prove to be unnecessary for the Saudis in the
long-run, given their recent attempts at developing a new generation of
highly educated scientists and public desire for a civilian nuclear
program]{.underline}.¶

#### Tons of evidence and experts agree -- Pakistan will sell 2 nuclear warheads to Saudi if they want to rapidly prolif

Amir **Mir,** Oct 4, **2011**, senior Pakistani journalist with The
News, Is Pakistan helping the Saudis with a nuclear deterrent?, Rediff,
<http://www.rediff.com/news/special/is-pakistan-helping-the-saudis-with-a-nuclear-deterrent/20111004.htm>

As early as 1969, the Pakistan air force flew the aircraft of the royal
Saudi air force to help fend off an invasion from South Yemen. In the
1970s and 1980s, about 15,000 Pakistani soldiers were stationed in Saudi
Arabia to protect the country\'s oil fields. [Against the backdrop of
the recent uprisings in the Middle East and the Arab world]{.underline}
which led to the ouster of several autocratic rulers of the Muslim
world, [Pakistan had played a key role in the region by supporting Saudi
Arabia to preempt a possible revolt against the Saudi
kingdom.]{.underline} Besides placing two army divisions on standby to
help Riyadh should any trouble break out, the Pakistan government helped
the Saudi kingdom with the recruitment of thousands of ex-Pakistani
military personnel for Bahrain\'s national guard. [Resultantly,
Islamabad has received more financial aid from the Saudis than any other
country outside the Arab world]{.underline}. [Those in Riyadh who favour
the preparation of a nuclear programme for military uses in cooperation
with Pakistan include Saudi Defence Minister]{.underline} Sultan Bin
Abdul [Aziz, and its former intelligence chief]{.underline}, Turki Bin
[Faisal.]{.underline} [Hence, while progressing towards this end
[several Pakistani nuclear scientists recently visited Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} to meet]{.underline}, among others, Prince Bandar Bin
Sultan, the head of the Saudi national security council and former
ambassador to the United States. Prince [B[andar is]{.mark} considered
[among those in the]{.mark} Saudi [royal family who are encouraging the
nuclear connection with Pakistan to put his country on a secret path
to]{.mark} [becoming nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the UPI
report, [Saudi Arabia is beefing up its military links with Pakistan to
counter Iran]{.underline}\'s expansionist plans which includes acquiring
atomic arms from the only Muslim nuclear power or its pledge of nuclear
cover. [\'[Pakistan has become a]{.mark} front-line State for Sunni
Islam]{.underline} and is being positioned by its leaders, particularly
in the powerful military and intelligence establishments, [as a
[bulwark]{.mark} [against Shia Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} and its
proxies. [[Increasingly, Pakistan is rushing to the defence of Saudi
Arabia, with whom it has a long had discreet security
links]{.underline}]{.mark},\' the UPI report said. The UPI report added
that the [[concerns about Saudi plans to buy readymade nuclear weapons
were raised]{.mark} in]{.underline} June [1994]{.underline}. A Saudi
defector, Mohammed Abdalla al-Khilewi, the No 2 official in the Saudi
mission to the United Nations in New York, claimed Riyadh had paid up to
\$5 billion to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein \[ Images \] to build it a
nuclear weapon. Al-Khilewi is a former Saudi Arabian diplomat noted for
his brazen May 1994 defection in which he issued a declaration on the
Saudi embassy letterhead proclaiming King Fahd to be despotic and
calling for a redistribution of the country\'s wealth and power. [An
expert in nuclear proliferation]{.underline}, al-[[Khilewi had produced
13,000 documents to support his claim that Saudi Arabia was engaged in a
secret 20-year effort to acquire nuclear weapons]{.mark}, first with
Ira]{.underline}q, which Riyadh backed in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war,
[and then with Pakistan. [His documents showed that Riyadh helped
bankroll Pakistan\'s clandestine nuclear project and signed a
pact]{.mark}]{.underline} that in the event Saudi Arabia was attacked
with nuclear weapons, Islamabad would immediately respond against the
aggressor with its own nuclear arms. [[Well-informed diplomatic circles
in Islamabad believe the recent media reports about a possible nuclear
cooperation between Riyadh and Islamabad are
credibl]{.mark}e.]{.underline} According to them, Saudi Arabia and
Pakistan have developed extensive defence and strategic ties to an
extent that [Riyadh is now secretly working on an alleged nuclear
programme with the help of Pakistani experts.]{.underline} [The nuclear
partnership between Riyadh and Islamabad is reportedly aimed at
providing the kingdom with a nuclear deterrent on short notice if and
when needed]{.underline}. Determined not to fall behind in the Middle
East nuclear race, [[Saudi Arabia has]{.mark} allegedly [arranged to
make available two Pakistani nuclear bombs or guided missile
warheads]{.mark}]{.underline} which are most probably held in
Pakistan\'s nuclear air base at Kamra in the northern district of Attock
in Punjab province. In fact, the fresh reports about the Pakistan-Saudi
nuclear deal were prompted by the International Atomic Energy Agency\'s
recent disclosure that Iran has begun to install the centrifuges in its
uranium enrichment facility in Natanz.

#### Saudi will buy nukes from Pakistan -- top security source and wikileaks proves

Andrew **Roberts**, Jan 2, **2011,** historian & a fellow of the Royal
Society of Literature, Iran\'s Nuclear Domino Effect, The Daily Beast,

[www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/01/02/irans-nuclear-weapons-could-lead-to-a-saudi-and-pakistan-alliance.html](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/01/02/irans-nuclear-weapons-could-lead-to-a-saudi-and-pakistan-alliance.html)

Might the impending nuclearization of Iran rapidly lead to a situation
in which India targets nuclear weapons on Saudi Arabia? That is one of
the many unnerving repercussions envisaged in an authoritative article,
"The Dangers of a Nuclear Iran," in the current issue of Foreign
Affairs, written by, among others, [Eric Edelman]{.underline}, President
George W. [Bush's undersecretary of defense for policy]{.underline} from
2005 to 2009. [When an analyst of Edelman's seniority and ability, who
moreover was working in the Pentagon with full access to all the
available intelligence on precisely this issue as recently as two years
ago, pronounces on questions of this gravity it behooves us to pay
serious attention.]{.underline}

Writing under the auspices of the high-powered defense think tank the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments,
[E[delman]{.mark}]{.underline} and two colleagues [[examine the
ramifications of Saudi Arabia attempting swiftly to acquire nuclear
weapons from Pakistan the moment that it is clear that Iran has them. He
reports "rumors that Riyadh and Islamabad have had discussions involving
nuclear weapons, nuclear technology, or security guarantees]{.mark}."
Now[, people who have held jobs as sensitive as Edelman's do not report
"rumors" in a respected journal like Foreign Affairs unless they believe
them to be very much more than that]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both in the
article and more fully in an interview I have conducted with him today,
Edelman sets out his thinking on a subject that should have very
profound implications for decision-making in the Obama administration as
it considers the long-term ramifications of permitting Iran to go
nuclear. For although we can all see the primary and perhaps also the
secondary implications for security in the Middle East of the so-called
containment strategy, the United States must now ponder the long-term
tertiary and even later consequences. [One of these must be what Edelman
terms "the Islamabad option," by which the Saudis and Pakistanis would
effectively enter into an offensive-defensive "dual-key" nuclear
arrangement, rather like the one the U.S. has had with Britain from the
late-1960s to the present day. The Saudis have already indicated
privately---and WikiLeaks has done nothing to cast doubt on
this---that]{.underline} when what Edelman terms "the nuclear cascade"
is unleashed [once Iran goes nuclear, they will be in the first wave.
"Saudi Arabia is the lynchpin]{.underline}," says Edelman, "the key
country." [[The extremely close links between the two Sunni countries
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which go back at least as far as
1979]{.mark}]{.underline} when Pakistan helped to clear Islamic
fundamentalists out of the Grand Mosque, [and]{.underline} A.Q. [[Khan's
time in Saudi Arabia at precisely the time when his
nuclear-proliferation ring was at its most active]{.mark}, invite what
Edelman guardedly calls "speculation" that a mutually convenient
arrangement would be arrived at very soon after Iran went
nuclear.]{.underline}

#### Pakistan will provide Saudi with either weapons or the technical support to quickly prolif. Or they will move their nukes to Saudi, which avoids NPT violation.

Andrew **Roberts**, Jan 2, **2011,** historian & a fellow of the Royal
Society of Literature, Iran\'s Nuclear Domino Effect, The Daily Beast,

"[[Pakistan could sell operational nuclear weapons and delivery systems
to Saudi Arabia]{.mark}," states Edelman, "[or it could provide the
Saudis with the infrastructure, material, and the technical support they
need to produce nuclear weapons themselves]{.mark} within a matter of
years, as opposed to a decade or longer." [The Saudis might not
even]{.mark}, technically at least, [be violating the N]{.mark}uclear
Non-[P]{.mark}roliferation [T]{.mark}reaty [if the weapons remained
operated by the Pakistanis, albeit on Saudi
territory]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor does Congress consider this all to
be mere "speculation" either: The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
Staff Report of February 2008 stated that there was "some circumstantial
evidence" to suggest that an agreement of some sort might already exist
between the two countries.

#### Pakistan would sell to Saudi, despite their public statements that they won't. Saudi would even violate promises to the US if it perceives Iranian edge.

Hugh **Tomlinson, Feb 11, 2012,** Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear
weapons to counter Iran, The Australian,
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/saudi-arabia-to-acquire-nuclear-weapons-to-counter-iran/story-fnb64oi6-1226268171576>

SAUDI Arabia could acquire nuclear warheads within weeks of Iran
developing atomic weapons as the threat from Tehran triggers an arms
race across the Middle East. In the event of a successful Iranian
nuclear test[, [Riyadh would immediately launch a twin-track nuclear
weapons program]{.underline}. [Warheads would be purchased off the shelf
from abroad, with work on a new ballistic missile platform getting under
way to build an immediate deterren]{.underline}]{.mark}[t]{.underline},
according to Saudi sources. [At the same time, the Saudi kingdom would
upgrade its planned civil nuclear program to include a military
dimension]{.underline}, beginning uranium enrichment to develop
weapons-grade material in the long term. Saudi officials emphasise that
Riyadh has no military nuclear program at present and will continue to
lobby for nuclear disarmament across the region. But the Saudi
government accepts privately that there is no chance of Israel
surrendering its undeclared arsenal of warheads, and Riyadh is
determined to match Tehran if its arch enemy in the Gulf goes nuclear.
Like many Western powers, Riyadh is convinced that Iran is seeking to
build nuclear weapons, and is preparing for a worst-case scenario should
Western efforts to halt Iran\'s nuclear advance fail. [The Times has
learnt that [c]{.mark}ommanders of Saudi Arabia\'s Strategic Missile
Force have been actively considering the missile platforms on the
market.]{.underline} \"There is no intention currently to pursue a
unilateral military nuclear program but the dynamics will change
immediately if the Iranians develop their own nuclear capability,\" one
senior Saudi source said. \"Politically, it would be completely
unacceptable to have Iran with a nuclear capability and not the
kingdom.\" [[Pakistan is the most likely vendor of warheads to
Riyadh]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Western officials. [Saudi
Arabia is believed to have shouldered much of the cost of Pakistan\'s
nuclear program and bailed out Islamabad when it was sanctioned by the
West after its first nuclear test,]{.underline} in 1998. [In exchange,
[the countries have long been rumoured to have an agreement whereby
Pakistan would sell Saudi Arabia warheads and nuclear technology if
security in the Gulf deteriorated.]{.mark} Riyadh and Islamabad have
persistently denied that any such arrangement exists, but Western
defence officials]{.underline} and diplomats [in Riyadh are convinced
there is an understanding]{.underline}. One said the kingdom would call
in its favour from Pakistan \"the next day\" after an Iranian nuclear
test and could have warheads within weeks. [[This would place Saudi
Arabia in breach of a memorandum of understanding signed with the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2008, [promising US assistance with civil
nuclear power on condition that Riyadh does not pursue \"sensitive
nuclear technologies[\". But if Tehran builds a bomb, the regional
landscape would change completely.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT Sanctions

#### Sanctions don't stop prolif---Saudi is immune

[Years of Saudi investment and cooperation with the Pakistani nuclear
program provides an avenue for short-term procurement of a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}. [However, recent education initiatives
by]{.underline} King [Abdullah --- providing legions of the best and
brightest young Saudi scientists and engineers training at world-class
institutions abroad --- allow for the possibility of a]{.underline}
long-term [nuclear weapons program in the kingdom itself]{.underline}. ¶
**[Saudi Arabia\'s consistent position as the world\'s largest single
producer of oil could grant the kingdom immunity from potential
sanctions]{.underline}**, similar to those facing Iran. This is
especially the case if the world supply of oil is already hampered by
existing sanctions on another major producer.

#### Sanctions on Saudi wouldn't work---they simply sell too much oil for any regime to be effective

**Weinberg, 3-31-15** \-- Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies

(David Andrew, Doomsday: Stopping a Middle East Nuclear Arms Race,
National Interest,
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/doomsday-stopping-middle-east-nuclear-arms-race-12511?page=2)

[Imagine the imposition of financial sanctions on the central bank of
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]{.underline}---the only Arab member of the
G20 group of major economies. [To this, add biting multinational trade
sanctions to stop the the majority of Saudi Arabia's oil production from
being sold on international markets]{.underline}. **[If these measures
seem preposterous, it is because they are]{.underline}**. Yet American
counter-proliferation policy in the Middle East may be premised on
implementing this bizarre, nightmarish scenario.¶ During recent
testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Deputy Secretary
of State Antony Blinken suggested that "the best way" to prevent a
nuclear arms race in the Middle East is through "the model that's being
set" via the P5+1 nuclear negotiations with Iran. Blinken elaborated,
saying that "I doubt any country would want to follow" the model set by
Iran of "a decade or more of isolation and sanctions." In short, the
"answer" for how to prevent a Middle Eastern nuclear cascade "is exactly
what we've been doing."¶ Yet [virtually every Sunni power in the region
is moving to develop its nuclear power infrastructure]{.underline}, in
part due to burgeoning domestic demand for electricity, but also in
response to Iran's nuclear program. Saudi Arabia's former intelligence
chief, Prince Turki al-Faisal, explained this month to the BBC that
"whatever comes out of these talks, we will want the same." He noted
that in particular, "if Iran has the ability to enrich uranium to
whatever level, it's not just Saudi Arabia that's going to ask for
that."¶ In addition to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, and the
United Arab Emirates are all embarking on nuclear energy crash programs.
Experts believe several of these states have concluded that nuclear
energy offers opportunities not just for domestic energy production but
also for military purposes, so that they can "pick up some capabilities
along the way." Amman just reached a \$10 billion deal with Russia to
build Jordan's first nuclear power plant, and the Russians signed a
similar agreement to construct the Egyptians' first plant when Putin
visited Cairo in February. No doubt the Emiratis are regretting signing
a 2009 U.S. agreement offering to forego the right to enrich uranium in
exchange for American nuclear cooperation ever since Iran has
effectively been granted a de facto right to domestic enrichment.¶ But
[the country that most feels itself in Iranian crosshairs is Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. The late Saudi King Abdullah once urged America to
launch military strikes on Iran's nuclear program to "cut off the head
of the snake" and warned the United States point blank that "if they get
nuclear weapons, we will get nuclear weapons." Saudi King Salman is
currently walking back his predecessor's regional campaign against the
Muslim Brotherhood in order to press the Brotherhood's regional
supporters---Turkey, Qatar, Sudan, and Hamas---to assist with his more
immediate priority of confronting Iranian depredations in the region.
The new Saudi-led military campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi
insurgents in Yemen, code named Operation Decisive Storm, is the latest
expression of the king's resolve.¶ As I told members of Congress in
testimony last year, the Saudis view Tehran's nuclear intentions through
the prism of its support for terrorism and other mischief-making
throughout the region. King Salman's designated heir, Crown Prince
Muqrin, once memorably explained to U.S. officials that claims about a
"Shi'ite crescent" extending through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon did not go
far enough; rather, he characterized Iranian activities as a "full moon"
encircling the Kingdom, affecting the Shi'ite population in its Eastern
Province as well as Saudi neighbors in Bahrain, Yemen, and Kuwait. This
deep skepticism of Iranian motives was only intensified when Iranian
officials began to gloat about the recent success of their Houthi
proxies at demolishing the Yemeni state.¶ While all six members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) formally welcomed the Joint Plan of
Action (JPOA) signed with Iran in November 2013, most of them privately
opposed it. Saudi Arabia's current ruler presided over a cabinet meeting
that issued a vaguely positive yet skeptical declaration in response to
the JPOA, but the editorial in a newspaper controlled by his son was
closer to Riyadh's genuine views on the agreement, treating it as a sign
that Washington is abandoning the Gulf.¶ The Saudis worry that if
sanctions are lifted under a nuclear deal, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) will be flush with cash to intensify its agenda of
regional subversion. By virtue of focusing solely on the nuclear in
talks with Iran, the P5+1 is guaranteeing Gulf Arab opposition to such a
deal.¶ In early March, when Secretary of State Kerry visited the Saudis
to brief them on nuclear talks with Iran, Riyadh had some tough words
for America's top diplomat about their security concerns. "Nothing will
be different the day after this agreement... with respect to all the
other issues that challenge us in the region" including "Iran's other
destabilizing actions." And wouldn't you know it, those were Kerry's
words.¶ The Secretary of State presumably meant his remarks to reassure
the Saudis---indicating that America would stand by its commitment to
the GCC's security in the face of Iranian paramilitary encroachments.
Yet ever since President Obama decided in 2013 not to enforce his red
line against the use of chemical weapons by Iran's Syrian proxy, Bashar
al-Assad, the Gulf monarchs have had additional reason to be skeptical.
Indeed, during their press conference, Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal took Kerry's remarks to their logical conclusion, emphasizing
that the GCC's first concern is not the Iranian nuclear program per se
but rather "everything else that Iran does," since it is through these
actions that the rest of the Gulf divines Iranian intentions. He has
since warned that Iran should not receive a nuclear deal it does not
"deserve" so long as Tehran is conducting "aggressive policies... and
ongoing interventions" in the region.¶ Viewed in this context, it should
come as little surprise that alumni of the Obama administration report
"we've been pressing them \[the Saudis\] to agree not to pursue a
civilian fuel cycle, but the Saudis refuse." Perhaps the best that can
be achieved in this regard is what Sigurd Neubauer of the Arab Gulf
States Institute calls the "silver standard," leveraging U.S. nuclear
expertise in exchange for Riyadh committing to obtain any reactor fuel
it requires on the international market instead of producing the
material itself. Added inspection requirements with the International
Atomic Energy Agency could also help some.¶ But [observers worry that
Saudi Arabia could bypass this hurdle altogether if Iran continues to
make progress toward a nuclear weapon by purchasing a Saudi bomb off the
shelf from Pakistan]{.underline}. The severe international consequences
of such a scenario mean that this possibility simply cannot be taken
lightly.

### AT Uranium Shortage

#### They'll get uranium from Jordan

**Trofimov 5-7-15** \-- writes a weekly column, Middle East Crossroads,
about the region stretching from West Africa to Pakistan

(Yaroslav, Saudi Arabia Considers Nuclear Weapons to Offset Iran, Wall
Street Journal,
http://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-considers-nuclear-weapons-to-offset-iran-1430999409)

In the immediate future, [Saudi Arabia wouldn't have to violate its
nonproliferation commitments even if it chooses to pursue that
path]{.underline}, said Mr. Heinonen, now a senior fellow at Harvard's
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.¶ "The first 4-5
years they don't need to even talk about sensitive technology---they
just have to keep it their mind. Over the next few years they will just
build this infrastructure, they will be really nice boys with IAEA, and
there will be no problem. I don't think they will go secret because
there is no point of doing it at this stage," he said.¶
[Conveniently]{.underline}, Mr. Heinonen added, [Saudi Arabia's neighbor
and close ally Jordan sits on the region's largest uranium reserves:
"Jordan has a lot of uranium but it has no money to extract it, so I
imagine the Saudis can work together with them."]{.underline}

### AT Zakaria

#### Zakaria is wrong---Saudi does have capability and science ranking doesn't dictate prolif ability 

**Lewis 15 - director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.**

Jeffery, Sorry, Fareed: Saudi Arabia Can Build a Bomb Any Damn Time It
Wants To, 6/12,
<http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/12/sorry-fareed-saudi-arabia-can-build-a-bomb-any-damn-time-it-wants-to/>

Fareed [Zakaria has written]{.underline} a predictably buzzy article
suggesting that, whatever Saudi officials might say, [Riyadh is simply
too backward to build a nuclear weapon.]{.underline} "Whatever happens
with Iran's nuclear program," Zakaria writes, "10 years from now Saudi
Arabia won't have nuclear weapons. Because it can't." While I don't
think it is terribly likely that Saudi Arabia will choose to build
nuclear weapons, I think it is deeply misguided to conclude that Saudi
Arabia (or pretty much any state) cannot do so. Simply put, [Zakaria is
wrong]{.underline} --- and it's not all that hard to demonstrate why.
[Zakaria isn't explicit about what he believes to be the technical
requirements for building a nuclear weapon]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} he clearly [thinks it is hard. Which was]{.underline}
probably [true in 1945]{.underline} when the United States demonstrated
two different routes to atomic weapons. [Since then]{.underline},
however, the [technologies]{.underline} associated with producing
plutonium and highly enriched uranium [have been developed, put to
civilian use, and spread around the globe. The fact that]{.underline}
most [states don't build nuclear weapons has a lot more to do with
**restraint** than not being able to figure it out]{.underline}.
[Zakaria's argument]{.underline} that Saudi Arabia can't build nuclear
weapons is pretty shallow and [relies]{.underline} largely
[on]{.underline} two assertions: [a flip comment about Saudi Arabia
lacking]{.underline} even [a domestic automotive industry, and a
superficially data-driven claim about Saudi Arabia's "abysmal" math and
science ranking.]{.underline} First, [automobile production is a
terrible indicator of whether a state can build a nuclear weapon. The
technologies are]{.underline} really [not]{.underline} at all
[similar]{.underline} --- or at least they don't have to be. India,
Pakistan, and North Korea all succeeded in building nuclear weapons
despite not having much of an auto industry at home. And the Soviets
were really good at building nuclear weapons, even though their cars
famously sucked. And, anyway, Saudi Arabia is investing in a domestic
auto industry. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is hoping the Meeya
will be on the market by 2017. So, there's that. More importantly,
[Saudi Arabia is investing in a civil nuclear industry]{.underline}.
**["Where would Saudi Arabia train the scientists to work on its secret
program?" Zakaria wonders. Oh, I don't know, how about the King Abdullah
City for Atomic and Renewable Energy?]{.underline}** Somehow Zakaria
never mentions that Saudi Arabia is building a dedicated city for
training nuclear scientists. I can't predict whether this investment
will pay off, but then again neither can Zakaria --- if he even knows it
exists. Zakaria is also skeptical because, he writes, [Saudi Arabia
"ranks 73rd in the quality of its math and science
education,]{.underline} according to the World Economic Forum ---
abysmally low for a rich country. Iran, despite 36 years of sanctions
and a much lower per capita GDP, fares far better at 44." [Abysmally low
for a rich country? Perhaps. But for a nuclear weapons state? Not
nearly]{.underline}. Let's do what he should have done and make a little
table using his own data. Here is a list of selected countries --- in
bold if they currently possess nuclear weapons --- by "Quality of Math
and Science Education." (Again, this is his data. Don't blame me!)∂
[Using Zakaria's own measure, Saudi Arabia would hardly be the least
nerdy country to acquire a nuclear weapon]{.underline}. Now, obviously
I'd prefer to have historical data. But I strongly suspect that China's
and India's rankings weren't nearly so high in 1964 and 1974 when they
conducted their first nuclear tests. The point is this: You don't need
to be a rich country, or have a great education system, to build a bomb.
This should be no surprise. Did I mention that we just celebrated the
70th anniversary of the first nuclear explosion, Trinity? Seventy years.
What other 70-year-old technology do we believe remains impossible for
non-European countries to acquire, even after several have done so? You
know what else was invented in the 1940s? Microwave ovens, solid-body
electric guitars, and the Slinky. I don't mean "acquire" in terms of
buying a nuclear weapon off the shelf --- I agree with Zakaria that is a
nutty idea. And I don't mean purchasing a turn-key infrastructure to
produce plutonium, as Syria did from North Korea, or highly enriched
uranium as Libya did from Pakistan's A.Q. Khan. No, I mean building a
bomb from scratch. The fancy machine tools, materials, and components
that were good enough to build the nuclear weapons of the 1970s are
widely available now. My favorite example is that one of the machine
tools linked to the A.Q. Khan network was a used Denn machine tool. If
you go to the Denn website, they tell you what their machine tools can
be used for: everything from armaments to kitchenware. And, be still
Fareed Zakaria's fluttering heart, auto parts. (Flow forming machines
make sweet rims.) Talk about dual use! The United States was deeply
skeptical that Pakistan could build centrifuges in the 1970s because of
the country's limited industrial base. What U.S. analysts didn't grasp
was that Pakistan's industrial base --- and that of every other
proliferator --- was the entire world. There is no reason to think this
problem went away with A.Q. Khan. Take a spin around Alibaba, the big
Chinese online B2B procurement site sometime. Moreover, a proliferator
doesn't have to try to acquire the most modern centrifuges. When U.N.
inspectors were stumbling across the remnants of the Iraqi nuclear
program in the early 1990s, they made a surprising discovery: Calutrons.
These were an obsolete uranium enrichment technology (electromagnetic
isotope separation) from the 1940s that fell out of favor after World
War II. Inefficient, sure, but good enough to make the highly enriched
uranium for the Little Boy bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Frankly, we're
lucky that nuclear weapons have not spread as quickly as the technology
to make them. Some of the success in slowing the spread of nuclear
weapons is down to sanctions, export controls, and the occasional air
strike. Most of the success, however, goes to the regime that
discourages states that could build nuclear weapons from doing so in the
first place. If you ask a policy wonk whether the nonproliferation
regime has been successful or not, the chances are better than even that
you'll hear about President John F. Kennedy's famous warning that "I see
the possibility in the 1970s of the President of the United States
having to face a world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have these
weapons." (It's kind of a standard talking point we all learn early on.)
That didn't happen --- and credit usually goes to the 1970 Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). To see why, look at the countries that
were in Kennedy's list of 15, 20, or 25 nuclear-armed states. Kennedy's
estimate came from a 1963 briefing paper provided by Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara that is now declassified. Here is McNamara's
chart:∂ Look at those names. They aren't rogue states, but rather a list
of the world's relatively industrialized countries, along with a few
developing regional powers like China and the UAR (The United Arab
Republic was a brief political union of Egypt and Syria). The working
assumption behind Kennedy's estimate was that any state that could build
nuclear weapons probably would. That's because, before the NPT, nuclear
weapons were seen by many people as just another weapon, part of any
modern military's future arsenal. In fact, virtually all the non-Warsaw
Pact countries on this list seriously considered a nuclear weapons
program. Australia, Sweden, and Switzerland all had active nuclear
weapons programs. The NPT helped changed that. (In the case of
Australia, Jim Walsh has written a particularly compelling account of
the role played by the NPT in constraining Canberra's nuclear
aspirations.) Treaties are absolutely necessary. It is simply not
possible to sustain a nearly universal regime through technology denial
and military action. The regime depends on the vast majority of states
choosing compliance, allowing the international community to focus its
enforcement efforts on a small number of hard cases like North Korea and
Iran. [The nonproliferation regime can only function with the support of
those states that can build nuclear weapons, but choose not to ---
states like Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The Saudis are clearly alarmed by
the possibility of an Iranian nuclear weapon. While I suspect that a lot
of the talk about acquiring nuclear weapons is intended to make the
United States focus on Saudi security concerns, it doesn't help to
dismiss Riyadh's anxieties by mocking their educational system and
ability to go nuclear. Rather, [we need to focus on making sure the
nonproliferation regime works for Saudi Arabia and other states. That
means closer consultations on regional defense issues, expanded security
arrangements,]{.underline} and crucially an attempt to head off an
Iranian bomb with a negotiated settlement. Fareed Zakaria may well win
his bet that the Saudis will not have a bomb in 10 years, but it's not
because they can't have one. If he wins --- and I hope he does --- it's
because the United States and other powers have successfully addressed
Iran's nuclear program and the regional security issues that would push
Riyadh toward a bomb. And who knows, maybe in 10 years we'll all be
driving Meeyas.

### AT Treaties

#### Saudi can quickly proliferate -- its treaty and agreement obligations are tentative and all rest on perceptions of Iran's advantage. It will use current air and missile systems or buy from China.

[Rising tension in the Persian Gulf over the Islamic Republic of Iran's
purported ambition of developing nuclear weapons could lead to a nuclear
arms race between Iran and]{.underline} the Kingdom of [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. On December 5, 2011, one of the most important
members of the Saudi royal family, Prince Turki Al-Faisal, stated that a
nuclear armed Iran would cause Saudi Arabia to seriously consider
obtaining nuclear weapons as well (Agence France Presse, December 5,
2011). Further adding fuel to speculation, [a recent report]{.underline}
in the Times of London, [citing a]{.underline}n unidentified [Saudi
security source linked to the Saudi Strategic Missile Force
asserted]{.underline} [that [in the event of an Iranian nuclear weapon
being developed, Saudi Arabia would immediately purchase nuclear weapons
and begin enriching its own uranium, possibly directly from
Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline} (Times, February 9). At present, the
Kingdom of [Saudi Arabia and its]{.underline} Gulf Co-operation Council
([GCC) allies are maintaining a public position of support for a
WMD-free zone in the Middle East]{.underline} (AP, January 25, 2012). In
conjunction with this policy[, [Saudi Arabia is expanding its peaceful
nuclear power generating capability]{.mark}]{.underline} as a means of
addressing rising domestic energy demand while saving valuable oil
assets for export. The Kingdom is maintaining an aggressive policy of
seeking multilateral agreements to address its need for nuclear power
plants, research nuclear reactors, and manufacturing capability for
nuclear fuels. To achieve this goal, [[Saudi Arabia has signed nuclear
technology agreements with]{.mark} Argentina, South Korea, France, and
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} (Arab News, January 16, 2012). Beyond the
pursuit of peaceful nuclear technology, Saudi [[Arabia\'s announcement
it was considering pursuing nuclear weapons to counter a growing Iranian
threat leads to many strategic questions about the Kingdom\'s likely
deployment methods]{.underline} [in the event it were to develop or
receive nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the political costs
that the Saudi government would incur with some of its closest allies
for seeking to possess nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The United States,
in particular, has expressed strong disagreement with a potential "Saudi
nuke," both as a matter of policy towards promoting a nuclear weapons
free Middle East, and due to questions amongst U.S. lawmakers whether or
not the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a trustworthy ally. [[Although the
Saudi and U.S. governments reached a tentative, non-binding agreement
for]{.mark} U.S.-Saudi [cooperation for civilian nuclear
technology]{.mark} in 2008, [no formal agreement exists between the two
nations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2011). In
the past year, senior United States law makers have severely criticized
the possibility of Saudi Arabia's acquisition of nuclear weapons. The
chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R),
captured the mood against supporting nuclear cooperation with Saudi
Arabia by stating that Saudi Arabia's "ties to terrorism and terror
financing alone should rule it out as a candidate for U.S. nuclear
cooperation," (Agence France Presse, July 30, 2011). In the event of a
policy decision to counter an Iranian nuclear weapon with a nuclear
weapon of its own, [[Saudi Arabia has several existing platforms for
deploying nuclear warheads]{.underline}]{.mark}. At present, [the
Royal]{.underline} Saudi [Air Force has dozens of operational tactical
fighter aircraft and short-range bombers that could double as delivery
vehicles for nuclear warheads]{.underline} such as the B61. These
aircraft include Saudi Arabia's aging fleet of Panavia Tornados, soon to
be replaced by the more capable European Typhoon, and the F-15S, and the
F-15SA. These latter aircraft were the subject of a recent \$29.4
billion purchase made by the Kingdom that will include 84 new F-15s and
modernization packages for the 70 existing F-15s in the Royal Saudi Air
Force (DefenseNews, December 29, 2011). [In addition]{.underline} to the
Royal Saudi Air Force\'s air-to-ground capabilities, [[the Kingdom
possesses one of the most robust networks of ballistic missile sites in
the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is estimated that Saudi Arabia
currently possesses 40-60 aging Chinese-manufactured CSS-2 medium-range
ballistic missiles, and an estimated 9-12 launchers to fire them. The
CSS-2, or East Wind system, is capable of delivering only non-nuclear
payloads within a 2,800 kilometer radius. The Saudi CSS-2 missiles are
currently aimed at major population centers within Iran, but are
terribly inaccurate and undependable, which raises questions about the
Saudi leadership\'s willingness to deploy such weapons (Nuclear Threat
Initiative, November, 2011). [[Iran\'s nuclear ambitions, coupled with
Saudi Arabia\'s]{.mark} [sizable]{.mark} but outdated [ballistic missile
system, increases speculation about recent sales discussions between the
Saudis and Chinese for a nuclear-capable, highly accurate
upgrade]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the Dongfeng 21 (DF-21 or
NATO-designated CSS-5). [If the Saudis were to purchase the
DF-21]{.underline}, a medium-range, road-mobile [ballistic missile, it
would signify a considerable operational improvement in accuracy,
mobility, and lethality.]{.underline} The DF-21 is capable of delivering
250 or 500 kiloton conventional warheads accurately within a 2,150
kilometer range. The road-mobile feature, provided by the
Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL), makes the DF-21 more survivable as
they are more difficult to target. (Missile Threat, February 14, 2012).
Saudi military planners will seek to exploit deficiencies in Iran's
missile defense. Iran\'s indigenously developed Bavar 373 missile
defense system, which was developed after Russia reneged on the delivery
of \$800 million worth of S-300PMU missiles, may be Iran\'s greatest
vulnerability. The Russian-made S-300 is widely recognized as one of the
world\'s most advanced missile defense systems. The Iranian government,
however, claims that their alternative is equally capable, a claim that
is difficult to corroborate given Iran\'s historical need to acquire
advanced radar and electronics technologies from suppliers abroad like
North Korea, Russia, and China (UPI, November 23, 2011). [The now public
insinuation of a Saudi "nuclear option" has upped the ante in the
Saudi-Iranian rivalry in the Middle East region, and would severely
strain relations between Saudi Arabia and some of its strongest allies,
including the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In over a year
of turbulent events in the region, [Saudi Arabia has asserted itself
vis-à-vis Iran in intervening militarily against popular demonstrations
against the Saudi allied]{.underline} al-Khalifa [monarchy in
Bahrain]{.underline}, [in developing its "Iran Initiative," and by
helping Qatar to spearhead a G.C.C. policy of supporting anti-Assad
movements in Syria,]{.underline} a longtime Iranian ally. Prince Turki's
statement and the continued assertions by individuals knowledgeable
about Saudi nuclear strategies indicate that Saudi Arabia is motivated
to confront an Iranian nuclear weapons program with a nuclear weapons
program of its own. [[Saudi Arabia has the technology and the strategic
partnerships necessary to quickly develop a nuclear weapons
capability.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The former director of Saudi Arabia\'s intelligence service stated this
week that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, then the Kingdom may be
forced to as well. Although Prince Turki al-Faysal couched his remarks
by first citing the world\'s failure to convince Israel to abandon its
nuclear weapons, then casually adding \"as well as Iran,\" his meaning
was perfectly clear - if Iran develops them, we\'ll buy our own. [[Saudi
Arabia is currently planning to build 16 nuclear reactors to generate

[In view of the perceived failure of their Iraq strategy, the

their access to the region and thus add to the complexity of the
strategic situation. India and China have to satisfy the increasing
energy needs of their economies and are therefore interested in good
relations with Iran and the GCC states alike. Russia and China are using
the market the region provides for their arms industries.

The third argument often cited relates to Saudi Arabia's nuclear
technology capabilities. Saudi Arabia lacks the human expertise and the
technical knowledge necessary to develop a nuclear weapons program on
its own. Experts consistently describe Saudi Arabia's nuclear
infrastructure and know how as far inferior to Egypt and Turkey.
However, many individuals emphasize that [[the U.S. should not
underestimate Saudi Arabia's ability to buy the technology
required]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many [scholars and U.S. diplomats believe
[Saudi Arabia may have some sort of formal or informal understanding
with Pakistan regarding nuclear weapons. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have
common interests and complementary assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pakistan
has a nuclear capability and limited money, while Saudi Arabia has no
nuclear capability and virtually unlimited money. While no solid
evidence exists to confirm the formalization of such an agreement, some
[[circumstantial evidence suggests an agreement or ''understanding'' may
exist]{.underline}.]{.mark}

THE SAUDI NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM In December 2006, [Saudi Arabia joined
the five other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council]{.underline}
(GCC) [to announce their intention to explore]{.underline} the
development of a shared [nuclear power]{.underline} program. These six
countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) join
Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, and Turkey as countries who have expressed
interest in developing nuclear energy programs in the wake of Iran's
nuclear activities. The GCC states have taken great pains to cooperate
with the IAEA fully and to progress in a transparent manner. At the
initial announcement, the Saudi Foreign Minister said, ''This is not a
secret and we are doing this out in the open. Our aim is to obtain the
technology for peaceful purposes, no more no less.'' 9 Despite these
assurances, numerous individuals interviewed by staff expressed a belief
that [the GCC announcement should be seen primarily as a response to
Iran's nuclear program. Analysts and scholars in the United States and
the Arab world interviewed by staff believe [the Saudi-led announcement
was intended to communicate to the Iranians, ''we can play this game
too,'' while building a foundation of nuclear knowledge and expertise
that would be useful should Saudi Arabia decide to pursue nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} in the future. This is not to suggest the
Saudis do not have an energy-based argument for their interest in
nuclear energy. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
Saudi Arabia's Water and Electricity Ministry (WEM) predicts that the
country's electricity demand will double by the years 2023--25. Saudi
Arabia already uses large amounts of its oil for domestic energy needs.
In fact, 7 years ago, 16 of every 100 barrels of Saudi oil were consumed
in Saudi Arabia. This year the amount of Saudi oil consumed in-country
has grown to 22 of every 100 barrels, even as the global oil market has
become tighter. As the Saudis seek to build an industrial infrastructure
and employ more Saudis, consumption demands will continue to grow.10
Given the high price of oil and gas, the Saudis would rather export
their fossil fuels than burn them. A nuclear power capacity would allow
the Saudis to export more oil and gas and consume less. However, [the
timing and the forum for the Saudi-led announcement suggests [the
primary purpose of the decision was to warn the Iranians and begin the
process of a nuclear- hedging strategy that will keep Saudi Arabia's
nuclear options open]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT NPT

#### NPT can't stop Saudi prolif

**Crimi 11** -- Frank, Saudi Up the Nuclear Ante, Front Page Magazine,
7-22, http://frontpagemag.com/2011/07/22/saudis-up-the-nuclear-ante/

Fearful that he will soon face a nuclear-armed Iran, Saudi Arabia's
Prince Turki al-Faisal recently
[warned](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/29/saudi-build-nuclear-weapons-iran)
that the Saudi Kingdom would have no choice but to develop its own
nuclear weapons, a move he said would lead to "untold and possibly
dramatic consequences." [While the Saudi's have long voiced the
strategic goal of a nuclear-free Middle East, they have also
unequivocally stated that they won't sit back and allow themselves to be
the only nonnuclear nation in the region.]{.underline} So, the remarks
by al-Faisal --- a former Saudi intelligence official --- simply echo
that view, one espoused by Saudi King Abdullah in 2006 when he said that
if Iran ever developed nuclear weapons, "everyone in the region would,
including Saudi Arabia." However[, with Iran now edging ever closer to
acquiring its own nuclear weapons, it appears the Saudis have actually
begun laying the groundwork for a similar pursuit]{.underline}. For
example, in April 2011, the Saudis
[purchased](http://www.thewallstreetshuffle.com/saudis-buy-advanced-nuclear-capable-missiles-in-china/)
from China advanced ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear
warheads. One of the missiles, the DF-21, can carry a 500kT nuclear
warhead over 1,800 kilometers. Moreover, in June 2011, the Saudi
government
[announced](http://www.arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article445147.ece) a
\$300 billion plan to build 16 nuclear reactors over the next 20 years.
While the Saudis have long been looking to develop a civilian nuclear
program to meet its increasing electricity demands --- having recently
[signed](http://www.china-defense-mashup.com/saudi-arabia-and-china-to-sign-nuclear-cooperation-pact.html)
nuclear cooperation agreements with both France and China --- [the
acquisition of nuclear power plants is the first crucial step in the
development of a nuclear weapons program.]{.underline}

Proliferation through Rose-Colored Glasses. [The [proliferation
optimist]{.mark} position has a distinguished pedigree]{.underline}, and
provides a useful rationale for actors interested in developing
strategic deterrence with limited means, [but it [provides a **weaker
intellectual framework**]{.mark} for comprehensively understanding the
likely effects of nuclear proliferation on international
politics]{.underline}. [Scott Sagan and other contemporary proliferation
pessimists have provided systematic and thoroughgoing critiques of the
proliferation optimism position]{.underline}.32 [Sagan shows that the
[spread of nuclear weapons leads to greater levels of international
instability]{.mark} because: states might conduct preventive strikes on
the nuclear facilities of proliferant states]{.underline}, [proliferant
states might not take the necessary steps to build a secure,
second-strike capability, and organizational pathologies within nuclear
states could lead to accidental or inadvertent nuclear
launch.]{.underline}33 As Frank Gavin writes in his review of the
optimism/pessimism debate, "The real problem, however, is that Sagan
plays small ball in his debate with Waltz, conceding the big issues. Why
not challenge Waltz on his core arguments about deterrence and
stability?"34 Rather than repeat the substantial efforts of previous
pessimists, therefore, I will take up Gavin's challenge and focus on
three big issues. In particular, this section maintains that
[proliferation [optimists]{.mark}: [present an **oversimplified version
of**]{.mark} **nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} theory**, [follow a line of
argumentation that contains]{.mark} an **[internal]{.mark} logical
[contradiction]{.mark}**, and do not address the concerns of U.S.
foreign policymakers]{.underline}. First and foremost, [proliferation
optimists present an oversimplified view of nuclear deterrence
theory]{.underline}. [Optimists argue that since the advent
of]{.underline} Mutually Assured Destruction ([MAD]{.underline}), [any
nuclear war would mean national suicide and, therefore, no rational
leader would ever choose to start one]{.underline}. Furthermore, they
argue that the requirements for rationality are not high. Rather,
leaders must value their own survival and the survival of their nation
and understand that intentionally launching a nuclear war would threaten
those values. Many analysts and policymakers attempt to challenge the
optimists on their own turf and question whether the leaders of
potential proliferant states are fully rational.35 [Yet]{.underline},
these debate overlook the fact that, apart from the optimists, [leading
nuclear deterrence theorists believe that nuclear proliferation
contributes to a real risk of nuclear war even in a situation
of]{.underline} Mutually Assured Destruction ([MAD]{.underline}) [among
rational states]{.underline}.36 [Moreover, realizing that nuclear war is
possible does not depend on peculiar beliefs about the possibility of
escaping MAD]{.underline}.37 Rather, as we will discuss below, [these
theorists understand that some risk of nuclear war is necessary in order
for deterrence to function]{.underline}. To be sure, in the 1940s,
Viner, Brodie, and others argued that MAD rendered war among major
powers obsolete, but nuclear deterrence theory soon advanced beyond that
simple understanding.38 After all, [great [power]{.mark} political
[competition **does not end with nuclear weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[And nuclear-armed states still seek to threaten nuclear-armed
adversaries]{.underline}. [States cannot credibly threaten to launch a
suicidal nuclear war, but they still want to coerce their
adversaries]{.underline}. [This leads to a credibility problem: how can
states credibly threaten a nuclear-armed opponent? Since the 1960s,
academic nuclear deterrence theory has been devoted almost exclusively
to answering this question.39 And their answers **do not give us reasons
to be optimistic**]{.underline}. Thomas Schelling was the first to
devise a rational means by which states can threaten nuclear-armed
opponents.40 He argued that [leaders cannot credibly threaten to
intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear war, but they can make a "threat
that leaves something to chance."]{.underline}41 [They can engage in a
process, the nuclear crisis, which increases the risk of nuclear war in
an attempt to force a less resolved adversary to back down. [As states
escalate]{.mark} a nuclear crisis [there is]{.mark} an [increasing
probability that the conflict]{.mark} [will **spiral out of
control**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [result in an]{.mark} **inadvertent** or
**[accidental]{.mark} [nuclear exchange]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As long
as the benefit of winning the crisis is greater than the incremental
increase in the risk of nuclear war, however, threats to escalate
nuclear crises are inherently credible. [[In]{.mark} these games of
[nuclear brinkmanship]{.mark}, [the state that is willing to **run the
greatest risk of nuclear war**]{.mark} before backing down [will
win]{.mark} the crisis]{.underline}, as long as it does not end in
catastrophe. It is for this reason that Thomas [Schelling called great
power politics in the nuclear era a "competition in risk
taking."]{.underline}42 This does not mean that states eagerly bid up
the risk of nuclear war. Rather, [they face gut-wrenching decisions at
each stage of the crisis. They can quit the crisis to avoid nuclear war,
but only by ceding an important geopolitical issue to an
opponent]{.underline}. [Or they can the escalate the crisis in an
attempt to prevail, but only at the risk of suffering a possible
**nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. Since 1945 there were have been
twenty high stakes nuclear crises in which "rational" states like the
United States run a frighteningly-real risk of nuclear war. 43 By asking
whether states can be deterred, therefore, proliferation optimists are
asking the wrong question. The right question to ask is: what risk of
nuclear war is a specific state willing to run against a particular
opponent in a given crisis? Optimists are likely correct when they
assert that a nuclear-armed Iran will not intentionally commit national
suicide by launching a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack on the United
States or Israel. This does not mean that Iran will never use nuclear
weapons, however. Indeed, [it is almost inconceivable to think that a
nuclear-armed Iran would not, at some point, find itself in a crisis
with another nuclear-armed power. It is also inconceivable that in those
circumstances, Iran would not be willing to run some risk of nuclear war
in order to achieve its objectives]{.underline}. If a nuclear-armed Iran
and the United States or Israel were to have a geopolitical conflict in
the future, over the internal politics of Syria, an Israeli conflict
with Iran's client Hezbollah, the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf,
shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, or some other issue, do we
believe that Iran would immediately capitulate? Or is it possible that
Iran would push back, possibly brandishing nuclear weapons in an attempt
to coerce its adversaries? If the latter, there is a risk that
proliferation to Iran could result in nuclear war and proliferation
optimists are wrong to dismiss it out of hand. [An optimist might
counter that nuclear weapons will never be used, even in a crisis
situation, because states have such a strong incentive, namely national
survival, to ensure that nuclear weapons are not used. But this
objection ignores the fact that **[leaders operate under competing
pressures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Leaders in nuclear-armed states also
have strong incentives to convince their adversaries that nuclear
weapons might be used]{.underline}. [Historically we have seen that
[leaders take actions]{.mark} in crises, [such as **placing**]{.mark}
**nuclear [weapons on high alert]{.mark}** [and **delegating**]{.mark}
**nuclear [launch authority to low-level commanders]{.mark}**, [to
**purposely increase the risk**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark} nuclear
[war]{.mark}** in an attempt to force less-resolved opponents to back
down]{.underline}. [Moreover, not even the optimists' first principles
about the irrelevance of nuclear posture stand up to
scrutiny]{.underline}. Not all nuclear wars would be equally
devastating.44 Any nuclear exchange would have devastating consequences
no doubt, but, if a crisis were to spiral out of control and result in
nuclear war, any sane leader would rather face a country with five
nuclear weapons than one with five thousand. Similarly, any sane leader
would be willing to run a greater risk of nuclear war against the former
state than against the latter. Indeed, [scholars have demonstrated that
**[states are willing to run greater risks]{.mark}** and are, therefore,
more likely to win nuclear crises when they enjoy nuclear superiority
over their opponents]{.underline}.45 [Proliferation optimists might be
correct that no rational leader would choose to launch a suicidal
nuclear war, but, depending on the context, any sane leader would almost
certainly be willing to risk one]{.underline}. Nuclear deterrence
theorists have also proposed a second scenario under which rational
leaders would be willing to instigate a nuclear exchange: limited
nuclear war.46 For example, by launching a single nuclear weapon against
a small city, a nuclear-armed state could signal its willingness to
escalate a crisis, while leaving its adversary with enough left to lose
to deter the adversary from launching a full-scale nuclear response. In
a future crisis between China and the United States, for example, China
could choose to launch a nuclear strike on a U.S. military base in East
Asia to demonstrate its seriousness. In that situation, with the
continental United States intact, would Washington choose to launch a
full-scale nuclear war on China that could result in the destruction of
many American cities? Or would it back down? China might decide to
strike after calculating that Washington would prefer a humiliating
retreat over a full-scale nuclear war. If launching a limited nuclear
war could be a rational strategic gambit under certain circumstances, it
then follows that the spread of nuclear weapons increases the risk of
nuclear use. To be sure, some strategic thinkers, including Henry
Kissinger, advocated limited nuclear war as a viable strategy only to
recant the position later due to fears of uncontrollable escalation.
Yet, this does not change the fact that [leading nuclear deterrence
theorists maintain that limited [**nuclear war is possible** among
rational leaders]{.mark} in a MAD world]{.underline}.47 In sum,
[proliferation optimists present an **oversimplified conception of
nuclear deterrence theory**]{.underline}. [Leading academic deterrence
theorists maintain that the spread of [nuclear weapons could **lead to
nuclear use**]{.mark} in **games of nuclear brinkmanship** and through
limited nuclear options even among rational leaders in a situation of
MAD]{.underline}. Indeed, [they understand that a risk of nuclear war is
necessary in order for nuclear deterrence to function]{.underline},
which leads us to our next point. [The second weakness in the
proliferation optimist argument is that it rests on an **internal
logical contradiction**]{.underline}. This might come as a surprise to
some, given that optimists are sometimes portrayed as hard-headed
thinkers, following their premises to their logical conclusions. But,
[the contradiction at the heart of the optimist argument is glaring and
simple to understand: either the probability of nuclear war is zero, or
it is nonzero, but it cannot be both]{.underline}. This is true whether
the risk of nuclear war is exogenous or endogenous to the behavior of
the actors involved; the probability of nuclear war simply cannot be
both zero and nonzero. [If the probability of nuclear war is zero, then
nuclear weapons should have no deterrent effect. States will not be
deterred by a nuclear war that could never occur and states should be
willing to intentionally launch large-scale conventional wars against
nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. [In this case, proliferation
optimists cannot conclude that the spread of nuclear weapons is
stabilizing]{.underline}. [If]{.underline}, on the other hand, [the
probability of nuclear war is nonzero, then [there is a real danger that
the spread of nuclear weapons will **result in a catastrophic nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this case, [proliferation optimists
cannot conclude that nuclear weapons will never be used]{.underline}. In
sum, [either the spread of nuclear weapons raises the risk of nuclear
war and, in so doing, deters large-scale conventional conflict. Or there
is no danger that nuclear weapons will ever be used and the spread of
nuclear weapons does not increase international stability]{.underline}.
But, despite the claims of many proliferation optimists, [it is
**nonsensical** to argue that nuclear weapons will never be used and to
simultaneously claim that their spread contributes to international
stability]{.underline}. As was argued above, [the most obvious way out
of this dilemma is to concede that **[nuclear proliferation does indeed
raise the risk of nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Prolif Fast / Bad

#### New and rapid proliferators are uniquely destabilizing -- offensive posturing, launch on warning, poor control

**[Horowitz 9]{.underline}** -- professor of Political Science at the
University of Pennsylvania (Michael, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons and
International Conflict: Does Experience Matter?," Journal of Conflict
Resolution, 53.2, Apr 09 pg. 234-257)

Learning as states gain experience with nuclear weapons is complicated.
While to some extent, [nuclear acquisition]{.underline} might provide
information about resolve or capabilities, it also [generates
uncertainty about the way an actual conflict would
go]{.underline}---given the new risk of nuclear escalation---[and
uncertainty about relative capabilities. **[Rapid
proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline} may [especially [heighten
uncertainty]{.mark} given the potential for reasonable states to
disagree]{.underline} at times [about the quality of the capabilities
each possesses]{.underline}.2 What follows is an attempt to describe the
implications of inexperience and incomplete information on the behavior
of nuclear states and their potential opponents over time. Since it is
impossible to detail all possible lines of argumentation and possible
responses, the following discussion is necessarily incomplete. This is a
first step. The acquisition of nuclear weapons increases the confidence
of adopters in their ability to impose costs in the case of a conflict
and the expectations of likely costs if war occurs by potential
opponents. The key questions are whether nuclear states learn over time
about how to leverage nuclear weapons and the implications of that
learning, along with whether actions by nuclear states, over time,
convey information that leads to changes in the expectations of their
behavior---shifts in uncertainty--- on the part of potential
adversaries. Learning to Leverage? When a new state acquires nuclear
weapons, how does it influence the way the state behaves and how might
that change over time? Although nuclear acquisition might be orthogonal
to a particular dispute, it might be related to a particular security
challenge, might signal revisionist aims with regard to an enduring
dispute, or might signal the desire to reinforce the status quo. This
section focuses on how acquiring nuclear weapons influences both the new
nuclear state and potential adversaries. In theory, systemwide
perceptions of nuclear danger could allow new nuclear states to
partially skip the early Cold War learning process concerning the risks
of nuclear war and enter a proliferated world more cognizant of nuclear
brinksmanship and bargaining than their predecessors. However, [each new
nuclear state has to resolve its own]{.underline} particular
civil--military [issues surrounding operational control and plan its
national strategy in light of its new capabilities. **[Empirical
research]{.mark}**]{.underline} by Sagan (1993), Feaver (1992), and
Blair (1993) [[suggests]{.mark} that viewing the behavior of other
states does not create the necessary tacit knowledge; there is **no
substitute for experience** when it comes to handling [a nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if experience itself cannot totally
prevent accidents. Sagan contends that [civil--military instability
in]{.underline} many likely [new proliferators]{.underline} and
pressures generated by the requirements to handle the responsibility of
dealing with nuclear weapons [[will skew decision-making toward]{.mark}
**more [offensive strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sagan 1995). The
questions surrounding Pakistan's nuclear command and control suggest
there is no magic bullet when it comes to new nuclear powers' making
control and delegation decisions (Bowen and Wolvén 1999). Sagan and
others focus on inexperience on the part of new nuclear states as a key
behavioral driver. **[[Inexperienced operators]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and the bureaucratic [desire to "justify" the costs spent developing
nuclear weapons, [combined with]{.mark}]{.underline} organizational
biases that may favor escalation to avoid decapitation---the "**[[use it
or lose it"]{.mark} mind-set]{.underline}**--- [[may cause new]{.mark}
nuclear [states to adopt]{.mark}]{.underline} riskier launch postures,
such as **[[launch on warning]{.mark},]{.underline}** or at least be
perceived that way by other states (Blair 1993; Feaver 1992; Sagan
1995).3 [Acquiring nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} could [alter
state preferences and [make states **more likely to escalate
disputes**]{.mark}]{.underline} once they start, [given their new
capabilities]{.underline}.4 But their general [lack of experience
at]{.underline} leveraging their nuclear arsenal and [effectively
communicating nuclear threats could mean new nuclear [states will be
more likely to **select adversaries poorly and to find themselves in
disputes with resolved adversaries that will reciprocate militarized
challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The "nuclear experience" logic also
suggests that more experienced nuclear states sahould gain knowledge
over time from nuclearized interactions that helps leaders effectively
identify the situations in which their nuclear arsenals are likely to
make a difference. Experienced nuclear states learn to select into cases
in which their comparative advantage, nuclear weapons, is more likely to
be effective, increasing the probability that an adversary will not
reciprocate. Coming from a slightly different perspective, uncertainty
about the consequences of proliferation on the balance of power and the
behavior of new nuclear states on the part of their potential
adversaries could also shape behavior in similar ways (Schelling 1966;
Blainey 1988). While a stable and credible nuclear arsenal communicates
clear information about the likely costs of conflict, [in the short
term, nuclear proliferation is likely to increase uncertainty about the
trajectory of a war, the balance of power, and the preferences of the
adopter]{.underline}.[\]{.underline}

administration, [[we could see a world of twenty or]{.mark} even [thirty
nuclear]{.mark}-armed [states by the

specific, near-term steps to shore up the current regime plus bold
actions to move eventually to a world completely free of nuclear
weapons.

crucial to understand the implications of nuclear proliferation for
international security. [This paper suggests that]{.underline}, at least
in terms of a systemic propensity for interstate conflict, [nuclear
proliferation might be welcomed]{.underline} -- [although, given that
nuclear asymmetry can provoke dyadic conflict, reducing this side effect
of nuclear proliferation by some other measure will be
desirable]{.underline}. Finally, [this paper should not be seen as
decisive evidence that nuclear proliferation contributes to
international security in general]{.underline}. [Nuclear proliferation
may increase risks of nuclear weapons being leaked to terrorist
groups]{.underline} (Bueno de Mesquita and Riker, 1982: 304) [or used
accidentally]{.underline} (Intriligator and Brito, 1981). **[It is
untenable to assess the merits and demerits of nuclear proliferation
only in terms of a systemic propensity for conflict]{.underline}**.
Additional research should examine these risks. Nonetheless, this paper
makes a significant contribution to the literature by adding new
empirics for a more comprehensive assessment of the relationship between
nuclear proliferation and interstate conflict.

### Saudi Alliance good -- Iran/Econ/terror

#### Saudi alliance good -- key to econ, counter-terror, and Iranian counterbalancing -- sustained support key

Strategy at Center for Strategic and International Studies Deborah
Jerome, Interviewer "Is Big Saudi Arms Sale a Good Idea?"
https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea

[The United States shares critical strategic interests with Saudi Arabia
that shape]{.underline} [the]{.underline} proposed [Saudi arms
sale]{.underline}. First, for all the talk of energy independence over
the last four decades, [the U.S. Department of]{.underline} [Energy
estimates]{.underline} that [the United States]{.underline} [will be as
**strategically dependent** on imported oil **through 2035 as it is
today**]{.underline}. [These projections do not even take account of our
indirect imports of oil in the form of manufactured goods, or our
dependence on the health of a global economy]{.underline} [that requires
stable supply- and market-driven prices]{.underline}. The [stability of
Gulf energy exports is **critical to our economy** and **every job in
the United States**]{.underline}

Second, **[U.S. military power is finite]{.underline}**, [and both the
United States and Saudi Arabia face **rapidly changing
threats**]{.underline}. [The United States needs allies that have
interoperable forces that can both fight effectively alongside the
United States and **ease the U.S. burden** by defending
themselves]{.underline}. [**Iran already poses a massive asymmetric**
naval-air-assault force **threat**]{.underline} to the Gulf states. [The
U.S. invasion]{.underline} of Iraq [has left]{.underline} [Iraqi forces
a decade away from being a counterbalance to Iran]{.underline}; [Saudi
Arabia is]{.underline} **[the only meaningful regional power to work
with]{.underline}**. Additionally, [al-Qaeda]{.underline} [in the
peninsula is **based in Yemen**]{.underline}, and [the threat
of]{.underline} [terrorism and outside infiltration]{.underline} [means
highly mobile Saudi forces are **critical to the security of Saudi
energy** and civil facilities]{.underline}. [Helping Saudi Arabia
create]{.underline} a combination of [effective air and naval
power]{.underline} also helps [**ensure the security** of]{.underline}
tanker and other [shipping in the Gulf of Oman]{.underline} [and
a]{.underline} steadily [more unstable Red Sea]{.underline}.

Third, [Iran]{.underline} already [poses a missile and chemical
weapons]{.underline} [threat]{.underline} **[and may pose a nuclear
one]{.underline}** [within the next **three** to five
**years**]{.underline}. [Upgrades of]{.underline} the [Saudi
Patriots]{.underline} [create a base for an integrated approach to air
and missile defense]{.underline}. [They lay the groundwork for follow-on
sales]{.underline} of advanced missile defense systems like
[THAAD]{.underline}, [and an emphasis on defense]{.underline} (not Saudi
purchases of missiles or nuclear systems). [Coupled]{.underline} [with
recent U.S. offers of \"extended regional deterrence]{.underline}\"
[and]{.underline} the [creation of a Saudi Air Force]{.underline} that
is [more of a threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, [they offer the]{.underline} **[best
hope]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} both [giving Saudi Arabia and other
Gulf states]{.underline} [security]{.underline} **[and stopping a
nuclear arms race]{.underline}** in the region.

Fourth, [the proposed]{.underline} arms sale [package]{.underline}
[creates a level of interdependence]{.underline} [that gives both the
current Saudi government]{.underline} [as well as Saudi governments for
the next fifteen to twenty years]{.underline} **[a strong incentive to
work with the United States]{.underline}**. [Saudi Arabia **will need
continuing support**]{.underline} [from the United States]{.underline}
[during **the entire lifecycle of every major system**
sold,]{.underline} [and no future Saudi government can ignore this
fact]{.underline}. Moreover, [the sales are large in dollar
terms]{.underline}, [but not in terms of numbers of
weapons]{.underline}. **[This will not be some kind of massive
build-up]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia had an air force with some 417
combat aircraft in 2000, and it now has only 219. The Saudi F-15 buy
will not even restore the force to 2000 numbers. [It will take some
three to five years to deliver and put fully in service]{.underline},
replace some eighty-seven obsolete F-5A/Bs and F-5EIIs that were in
service in 2000, [and help Saudi Arabia compensate for the serious
performance limits]{.underline} on 107 aging Tornados still in service.

#### Ending arms sales escalates provocative behavior

Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia"

[Depending on how severely the U.S. was to act]{.underline}, [cutting
defense cooperation]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
[produce]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [opposite effect]{.underline}
[than intended with respect to Saudi policies]{.underline}: **[Saudi

budge, rather than concede to Washington. [Should the U.S]{.underline}.
[cut only a few deals, or refuse to sell a few systems]{.underline},
**[the pressure will be so miniscule as to hardly
register]{.underline}** in Riyadh.

[A more aggressive approach]{.underline}, however, [would]{.underline}
[not be guaranteed to produce a better effect]{.underline} on Saudi
policy. [A useful comparison]{.underline} [may be the U.S. response to
Egyptian]{.underline} [President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's]{.underline}
[overthrow of Egypt's previous government]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
the [subsequent massacre of protestors]{.underline} in Rabaa. [The U.S.
criticized the government]{.underline} of President Sisi [and cut a
significant amount of arms cooperation]{.underline} pending improvement
toward a more democratic system.

[Two years later, the U.S. rescinded the policy]{.underline}, having
made little to no progress.\[iv\] [Bahrain hardly moved on its domestic
policies]{.underline} [despite]{.underline} [the U.S. temporarily
enacting a hold on the sale of F-16s]{.underline} to the country until
it improved its human rights record.

Perhaps extending these bans or making them bite harder would have the
intended effect, but [solely using coercive measures to target
governments based on their domestic policies]{.underline}, however
repulsive those policies may be, **[is not likely to produce positive
change]{.underline}**, [particularly if those policies are related to
what the government conceptualizes]{.underline} [as maintenance
of]{.underline} **[regime security]{.underline}**.

[Talk by prominent U.S. lawmakers]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [Saudi
Crown Prince]{.underline} [Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline} [has "got to
go"]{.underline} [while the U.S. is considering implementing these sorts
of coercive measures adds to the risk that Saudi Arabia might perceive
the U.S. actions as hostile]{.underline},\[v\] even if privately some
members of the royal court agree with the criticism of the Crown Prince
or see him as having gone too far in stamping out rivals.

### AT -- proxy war

#### Saudi involvement is the only hope for stability -- US support is key

**Posey and Phillips 2018**

Dec 6th, 2018 Madyson Hutchinson Posey Former Research and
Administrative Assistant James Phillips Senior Research Fellow, The
Heritage Foundation "Ending U.S. Military Support for Saudi Arabia in
Yemen Would Trigger Dangerous Consequences"
https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/ending-us-military-support-saudi-arabia-yemen-would-trigger-dangerous

In a new resolution, a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the
United States to end its involvement---specifically its support of Saudi
Arabia---in the Yemen conflict.

On Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to pass a procedural measure that
will clear the way for a floor debate on the issue next week.

The push comes largely in response to the recent murder of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The Trump administration has banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder
from entering the U.S., imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and
expressed its willingness to take further action if warranted by ongoing
investigations. Many senators seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even
if it means sacrificing the interests of the Yemeni government and
making a negotiated settlement of the conflict more difficult.

The killing of Khashoggi was certainly abhorrent, but [ending U.S.
support for the multinational coalition in Yemen is **not the proper
solution**]{.underline}. [It risks **dangerously
conflating**]{.underline} [two separate issues and would inevitably
**trigger unintended consequences**]{.underline} [that would **undermine
U.S. national security interests** in the region]{.underline}.

Senators must remember that [Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in
Yemen. A cutoff of U.S. support would also **hurt the elected and
internationally recognized government of Yemen**]{.underline}, [which
was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels]{.underline} in 2015 in a bloody
coup that violated a U.N.-brokered ceasefire.

[Withdrawing U.S. support]{.underline} [would]{.underline} also
[harm]{.underline} the [interests of other U.S. allies fighting in
Yemen]{.underline}, [including the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates [and]{.underline}
[Bahrain]{.underline}.

The war in Yemen is complex. [Those who rush to blame]{.underline}
[Saudi Arabia]{.underline} entirely [for the suffering of the
Yemeni]{.underline} [people]{.underline} [ignore]{.underline} the [war
crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their
opponents and the ruthless role]{.underline} that [Iran]{.underline}
[plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah]{.underline} ("Supporters of
Allah") [movement]{.underline}, a Shia Islamist extremist group.

The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian
casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But [the Houthis should
not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting
civilian]{.underline} target[s]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates [with increasingly sophisticated]{.underline}
[Iranian ballistic missiles]{.underline}.

[Ansar Allah]{.underline} also [deserves]{.underline}
[criticism]{.underline} [for its violent role in
destabilizing]{.underline} [Yemen]{.underline} [and
creating]{.underline} the [conditions]{.underline} [that led to the
current humanitarian disaster]{.underline}. [Ansar Allah regularly
attacks the Saudi border]{.underline}, [launches]{.underline} [missiles
strikes into Saudi Arabia]{.underline} [and the U]{.underline}nited
[A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates, [and diverts **international
medical and food aid**]{.underline} to favor its own supporters and sell
on the black market.

[Ansar Allah]{.underline} also [has]{.underline} [targeted U.S. Navy
vessels]{.underline}, [those of allied nations]{.underline}, [and
civilian shipping in]{.underline} [the Red Sea]{.underline} with
Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs. [Undermining
the Saudi-led coalition]{.underline} in Yemen [risks]{.underline}
**[exacerbating this threat]{.underline}** [to international
shipping]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [giving]{.underline} [Iran the
opportunity to threaten]{.underline} [oil shipments]{.underline}
[through the Bab al-Mandab Strait]{.underline}, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz.

[Those who advocate withdrawing]{.underline} [support]{.underline} for
Saudi Arabia apparently [believe]{.underline} that [they can
somehow]{.underline} [end]{.underline} [the current
conflict]{.underline} in Yemen [through a one-sided
strategy]{.underline} [that penalizes allies and boosts
Ansar]{.underline} [Allah]{.underline}, a group that chants "Death to
America" and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese proxy group,
every day.

Never mind that [Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally
recognized government]{.underline} of Yemen in this effort. Never mind
that [leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the
humanitarian suffering]{.underline}, but only prolong it.

The U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen
centered on intelligence and information sharing. There are no U.S.
troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional commando
raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni
terrorist group that continues to target the U.S. homeland, as well as
Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries.

The Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of
Saudi warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a
negotiated settlement. But [the United States cannot afford to abandon
its allies and hope for the best.]{.underline} [Undermining the Yemeni
government]{.underline} [and the Saudi-led coalition would make an
acceptable political settlement impossible]{.underline}.

[The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to fight this war
**with or without U.S. support**]{.underline}. [Those who]{.underline}
would connect two unrelated issues, [condemn Saudi
involvement]{.underline}, [and ignore Iran's hostile]{.underline}
[role]{.underline} [inside Yemen]{.underline} [will only do more harm to
innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran]{.underline} and its Yemeni
proxies.

#### Relations collapse inevitable -- structural shifts undermine the basis for the alliance

**Ashford 2018**

October 22, 2018 Emma Ashford is a Research Fellow in Foreign Policy
Studies at the Cato Institute "The U.S.-Saudi Alliance Was in Trouble
Long Before Jamal Khashoggi's Death"
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/us-saudi-alliance-was-trouble-long-jamal-khashoggis-death

Drifting Apart

Washington's willingness to criticize the Khashoggi murder owes as much
to the changing nature of the U.S.-Saudi relationship as to growing
repression. Though the few defenders of the Saudi government have
trotted out the standard arguments in favor of the U.S.-Saudi
partnership --- oil, regional politics, arms sales --- these arguments
are far less persuasive today than they were 35 years ago. The United
States simply no longer needs a close relationship with Saudi Arabia to
achieve its foreign policy goals and meet its energy needs.

Take oil. It's true that Saudi Arabia remains among the world's largest
producers of oil, producing around a quarter of the world's crude oil.
And thanks to changing production patterns --- notably the growth of
shale oil production in the United States --- America is far less
directly dependent on Middle Eastern energy.

Certainly, this doesn't mean Saudi oil supplies are unimportant to the
United States. Since oil is priced globally, Saudi domestic stability is
still key to ensuring a reasonable price for oil. Yet oil markets have
come a long way since the Carter Doctrine. During President Jimmy
Carter's time, the United States was reeling from twin oil shocks, as
the 1973 OPEC embargo and the 1979 Iranian revolution triggered oil
shortages and price hikes throughout the Western world. The Carter
Doctrine --- which promised to protect Middle Eastern oil-rich states,
prevent Soviet regional hegemony, and protect global oil supplies ---
effectively committed the United States to act as Saudi Arabia's
guarantor of security, a commitment fulfilled during the Gulf War.

[Today, most of these risks have disappeared]{.underline}.
[Innovations]{.underline} [like]{.underline} **[spot
pricing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[strategic
reserves]{.underline}** [help to stabilize the market during
shocks]{.underline}. [There is **no Soviet threat** poised to dominate
the region]{.underline}. To ensure the free flow of oil, the United
States doesn't need a heavy military presence in the region. Instead, it
needs to protect the global commons (i.e., sea lanes), and maintain the
expeditionary capacity to re-enter the region if it becomes necessary, a
posture often described as an over-the-horizon approach.

[Energy security]{.underline} is a good reason to maintain a U.S.
interest in Middle Eastern stability. It [is no longer a sufficient
reason to provide the Saudi government carte blanche]{.underline}.

Public understanding of these shifts in global energy production remains
limited, as illustrated by recent concerns about Saudi Arabia's empty
bluff to cut off oil supplies. But arguments about Saudi Arabia's
importance for regional stability are no less dated, and far more
visibly false; only 4 percent of Americans now consider Saudi Arabia to
be a U.S. ally.

In Yemen, for example, Saudi-led forces have repeatedly ignored the laws
of war, bombing schools and hospitals and refusing to allow necessary
supplies to reach civilians trapped by conflict. Yemen is now
experiencing a mass humanitarian crisis, including a famine that may
soon be the worst in a hundred years. In Syria, the Saudis have mounted
a concerted effort to fund and arm rebel groups in the fight against the
Assad regime. With little vetting and less oversight, many of these
weapons ended up in the hands of extremists.

These are only the most obvious examples. Saudi Arabia also actively
opposed many of the uprisings of the Arab Spring, with Saudi tanks
putting down a pro-democracy uprising in neighboring Bahrain. An
ill-advised blockade --- and apparent planned invasion of Qatar ---
remains unresolved, as does the kingdom's bizarre diplomatic spat with
Canada. And Saudi money --- both private and public --- has long pushed
an intolerant and hardline version of Islam that continues to inspire
extremism throughout the region.

[America's key interest in the Middle East is stability]{.underline}.
[Yet in recent years,]{.underline} [Saudi foreign policy has far more
often been destabilizing than stabilizing]{.underline}. [Saudi Arabia is
often portrayed as a bulwark against Iranian regional
influence,]{.underline} [but it's unclear why a destabilizing
reactionary Saudi foreign policy **is any better** than a revolutionary
Iranian one]{.underline}. [Just as Iran sponsors Hezbollah]{.underline},
[Saudi Arabia has sponsored various]{.underline} [militant
groups]{.underline} in Syria. Iran meddles in Lebanese politics, while
Saudi Arabia recently kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister. [If
America's regional interest is stability --- rather than simply taking
sides --- it doesn't make sense to back either country in their regional
aspirations.]{.underline}

[Even arms sales]{.underline} --- a more contemporary argument in favor
of a close partnership with Saudi Arabia --- [are no longer
convincing]{.underline}. With his typical exaggeration, President Donald
Trump cited \$110 billion in arms sales and the resulting U.S. jobs as
an excellent reason to maintain good relations with Riyadh. In fact,
[experts assess that Saudi arms sales are in reality worth only about
\$20 billion]{.underline}, [while the 4,000 jobs created are a tiny
fraction of the overall U.S. defense industry]{.underline}. With Saudi
human rights abuses now regularly making headlines, it is much harder to
justify the sale of offensive weapons to the kingdom.

A Failing Marriage of Convenience

[These gradual changes]{.underline} in the U.S.-Saudi relationship [have
been slowly felt in recent years.]{.underline} [Even before Khashoggi's
death]{.underline}, [the Kingdom's bloody war in Yemen generated
pushback from human rights groups]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Trump's
close relationship with the government]{.underline} of Saudi Arabia [has
driven journalists to explore the free flow of Saudi money]{.underline}
[into institutions and lobbying firms]{.underline} here in Washington.

Perhaps the biggest change has been on Capitol Hill, where the Saudi
alliance once enjoyed wholehearted support. [A younger generation of
policymakers]{.underline} like [Murphy]{.underline}, Sen. Mike
[Lee]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Rep. Ro [Khanna]{.underline}
[now]{.underline} [argue for fewer arms sales, an end to U.S. support
for the war in]{.underline} Yemen, [and a shift to a more arms-length
relationship]{.underline} with Saudi Arabia. [Nor is the opposition
limited to new arrivals]{.underline}; Sen. Bernie [Sanders has been an
open and repeated critic of Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

[Opinion has shifted even further in the last few weeks]{.underline}:
[Congress has called for a]{.underline} Magnitsky
[investigation]{.underline} into Khashoggi's death, [suggesting the
potential for sanctions]{.underline}. [Even]{.underline} Sen. Lindsey
[Graham]{.underline}, typic[ally an ardent supporter of Saudi Arabia,
vowed to "sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabi]{.underline}a." Ever the
trigger-happy proponent of regime change, the senator even called for
Mohammed bin Salman to be removed from power.

[Certainly, the Saudi regime retains the support of the White
House]{.underline}, which sees Saudi backing for the anti-Iran campaign
and potential willingness to prop up oil prices as sufficient to win its
loyalty. [**Yet Western companies are pulling their support**
for]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia's Future Investment
Initiative]{.underline} conference later in the month, and [Saudi money
is becoming **increasingly toxic** in Washington]{.underline}.

With the increasing divergence between Saudi and American interests, the
Khashoggi murder offers an opportunity for lawmakers. Sanctions
legislation, or legislation forbidding the use of U.S. forces to back
the Saudi-led War in Yemen, would send a clear signal that Saudi
behavior is unacceptable. It would lay the groundwork for a future
administration to adopt a more balanced approach to the Middle East, one
focused on stability, not on supporting the goals of any one state. And
it would reorient American foreign policy to more accurately reflect the
reality of the global oil market: that Saudi Arabia's future
increasingly lies in selling its resources to Asia, not the West.

[Once, the U.S.-Saudi marriage of convenience served both sides
well]{.underline}. [But it was just that]{.underline} --- **[a marriage
of convenience]{.underline}**. [With changes in the oil market and
regional security]{.underline}, [the rationale for the
relationship]{.underline} [has been diminishing for years]{.underline}.
It has undoubtedly taken time for opinion in Congress and elsewhere to
catch up to this reality. It may take longer still --- into the next
administration --- for the White House to finally acknowledge that the
Saudi alliance no longer serves U.S. needs. But [the shock of
Khashoggi's death has created an opening to reassess this alliance,
highlighting that Americans have no shared values with Saudi Arabia, and
perhaps, fewer shared interests than they thought]{.underline}.

**Carney 19**, Jordain Carney, \"Trump, Congress set for new showdown on
Saudi Arabia,\" TheHill, 6-27-2019,
https://thehill.com/homenews/house/450545-trump-congress-set-for-new-showdown-on-saudi-arabia
dw

[Lawmakers and]{.underline} President [Trump are laying the groundwork
for a new showdown over Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, underscoring deep
frustrations on Capitol Hill. [With Trump expected to veto
resolutions]{.underline} blocking his arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
[lawmakers are already eyeing additional avenues to push back on the
U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline}, which has soured in Congress over
the Yemen civil war and the death of Washington Post contributor Jamal
Khashoggi. [Members in both chambers are moving forward
with]{.underline} separate [bills that would hem in Trump or penalize
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. [The House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced
a bill]{.underline} Wednesday [that would require]{.underline} the
director of [national intelligence to determine who is responsible for
Khashoggi's death]{.underline} [and]{.underline} would
[impose]{.underline} visa [restrictions on those people.]{.underline}
Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said he expects that bill to
come to the floor "shortly" after the July Fourth recess. "The horrific
murder of Jamal Khashoggi demands accountability and justice," Engel
said during the committee's consideration of the bill. "After the
astounding evidence we've seen, it can't just be business as usual. And
since the administration is dragging its feet on taking any meaningful
action, Congress must step forward." The action in the committee comes
as [several Saudi-related amendments have been filed for the House's
version of the N]{.underline}ational [D]{.underline}efense
[A]{.underline}uthorization [A]{.underline}ct, [including measures to
block]{.underline} the [arms sales]{.underline}, [amend the
A]{.underline}rms [E]{.underline}xport [C]{.underline}ontrol
[A]{.underline}ct [and end U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition
in Yemen]{.underline}, among others. The House will take up the mammoth
defense bill next month, though only a fraction of the 600-plus
amendments typically get a vote. [The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
also approved legislation]{.underline} this week [that would restrict
Trump's ability to use an "emergency" provision of the A]{.underline}rms
[E]{.underline}xport [C]{.underline}ontrol [A]{.underline}ct to bypass a
requirement that the administration give Congress a 30-day notification
before an arms sale. Several Republicans have raised concerns about how
the administration used the emergency provision, bolstering its chances
of picking up additional GOP support outside of the committee. [The
bipartisan legislation]{.underline}, spearheaded by Sen. Bob Menendez
(D-N.J.), [comes after Trump sparked fierce backlash by leapfrogging
Congress on a deal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia despite bipartisan
opposition]{.underline} on Capitol Hill. The administration argued that
Iran's actions in the region required enacting the emergency language on
the Arms Export Control Act and forcing through the sale. Menendez said
that he hasn't gotten a commitment for a floor vote on his legislation
but that he "is going to push for it." Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jim Risch (R-Idaho) is also drafting additional Saudi
Arabia legislation that he is expected to unveil after the recess. Risch
has stressed he wants a bill that could win over both White House and
Democratic support, a potentially high bar given the deep differences
between some lawmakers and Trump when it comes to Saudi Arabia. "Some of
the things that have happened cannot go unnoticed. There are certainly
going to have to be repercussions and we have been negotiating with all
parties, including my staff and the staff of the ranking member,
together with the State Department and the White House," Risch said
during a recent floor speech, announcing that he and Menendez had set up
a framework for further committee action. Menendez is expected to offer
the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act as an amendment to the
forthcoming Risch legislation. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been
at the center of the chamber's Saudi Arabia action, said he had also
been in touch with Risch as the GOP senator has drafted the bill and
"we've given some suggestions to the chairman about it." [The push for
additional action comes as the House still needs to vote on resolutions
blocking Trump's arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and Jordan]{.underline}. The 22 arms sales, estimated to be worth more
than \$8 billion, include precision-guided bombs, Patriot missiles,
mortar rounds, drones, fighter jet parts and other military support.
Engel said he does not have a specific timeline for considering the arms
sales resolutions but vowed to take them up in his committee. "We're
absolutely going to pursue it," he said. "We've already had some
classified briefings. And it's too important an issue because it has
repercussions not only for Saudi Arabia now, but for lots of countries,
including Saudi Arabia, down the road." Asked if there is a rush to pass
the resolutions before the first weapons are delivered, Engel would not
comment on the timeline of the deliveries, citing classified
information. But in general, he said, ["the deadline is
now.]{.underline} We have to move on these things now." A spokesperson
for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told The Hill that they
would plan to bring the Senate-passed resolutions to the floor in July.
Trump is expected to veto the resolutions of disapproval; the Senate
will not have the votes to override the veto after initially passing the
resolutions blocking the sale with 51 and 53 votes, respectively. But
[the push for additional legislation is the latest sign of the growing
frustration on Capitol Hill about the U.S.-Saudi
relationship]{.underline}. [The Senate passed a resolution last year
that named Saudi Crown Prince]{.underline} [Mohammed bin Salman as
responsible for Khashoggi]{.underline}'s death. The resolution marked a
significant break with Trump --- he has refused to name the crown prince
as responsible --- but stalled in the then-GOP-controlled House.
Congress passed a separate resolution earlier this year forcing Trump to
remove troops in or affecting Yemen unless they were fighting al Qaeda;
Trump vetoed the resolution. But unlike the Yemen resolution or the move
to block Trump's arms sales, any additional legislation will need 60

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates on Thursday [added Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} and Cuba [to its blacklist of countries that it says
are not doing enough to fight human trafficking]{.underline}, a
designation [that could bring sanctions]{.underline}. In an annual
report, [the State Department faulted]{.underline} ally [Saudi Arabia
for rampant violations against its vast foreign labour
force]{.underline} and accused adversary Cuba of trafficking through its
programme of sending doctors overseas. Other countries that remained on
Tier 3, the worst ranking in the report, included China, Myanmar, North
Korea, Russia and Venezuela. A Tier 3 ranking means that the United
States can restrict assistance or withdraw support for the country at
the International Monetary Fund or other global development bodies.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States last year
took measures against 22 countries due to the designation, although the
president can issue waivers. \"[That action]{.underline} and the message
[that goes with it is very clear \-- if you don\'t stand up to
trafficking, America will stand up to you]{.underline},\" Pompeo said as
he presented the report [alongside Ivanka]{.underline} Trump, President
Donald Trump\'s daughter and adviser. On Saudi Arabia, the United States
said that the kingdom has often jailed, fined or deported human
trafficking victims, accusing them of immigration violations or
prostitution rather than providing assistance. The report called on
Saudi Arabia to do more to help workers fleeing abusive bosses and to
reform its sponsorship system, in which employers control workers\'
permits to leave the country. \"We want to makes sure that, particularly
for domestic workers, that they have the ability to change employers,
the ability to exit the country when they\'re ready to, and make sure
they have freedom,\" said John Cotton Richmond, the State Department\'s
ambassador-at-large for the fight against trafficking. Richmond, who
visited Saudi Arabia during the drafting of the Trafficking in Persons
report, said it was important to be truthful. \"Obviously there\'s a lot
happening in our relationship with Saudi Arabia; they\'re an important
ally,\" he told AFP. \"But we also want to make sure that we look at the
facts, we look at the information that is there, that we give an
accurate assessment,\" he said. \"For the TIP report to be useful, it\'s
got to have integrity.\" [Trump has faced growing criticism in Congress
for his staunch support of Saudi Arabia on multiple fronts, including
over its offensive in war-ravaged Yemen.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia will not]{.underline} likely [use civilian nuclear

so.]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia seeks to develop nuclear
technology]{.underline} [to meet growing energy demand]{.underline}, [as
well as to demonstrate]{.underline} to [Iran that Tehran]{.underline}
[does not have a monopoly on nuclear technology in the Gulf
region]{.underline}. Any [U.S. approval]{.underline} for Saudi Arabia to
develop nuclear power [will]{.underline} [carry significant
restrictions]{.underline} on the use of U.S. technology to preclude
Saudi Arabia from developing a nuclear weapon. [Saudi
leaders]{.underline} undoubtedly [understand]{.underline} that [the

Saudi Arabia: The human and technical impediments to a nuclear arsenal.
Saudi Arabia is viewed as the Middle East\'s most likely nuclear
proliferator. Riyadh has been the loudest voice in the region, claiming
it\'ll \"go nuclear\" should Iran do so. It also wants an enrichment
capability to mirror Iran's. **[An assessment of the nascent Saudi
nuclear power program shows that for all of [Riyadh]{.mark}\'s
foot-stomping, it [doesn\'t have the technical capability to build
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Even if
this]{.mark} technical deficit [could be overcome]{.mark}, its [allies
could influence its intentions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia has
ambitious plans for its nuclear industry. It wants to build 16 nuclear
reactors in the next few decades, but **[right now [Saudi Arabia does
not have any nuclear reactors]{.mark}, and its first won\'t go on line
[until 2022, at earliest]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To date, the King
Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KA-CARE) has scouted out
foreign suppliers and developed regulatory frameworks---but gone no
further down the nuclear path. **[[Riyadh lacks the human capacity to
develop and operate]{.mark} its own [nuclear infrastructure]{.mark} in
the foreseeable future.]{.underline}** But Saudi Arabia is aware of its
technical shortcomings, and it's looking for other options After
contributing financially to Pakistan\'s nuclear weapons program and
defense sector, the Saudis may want Islamabad to return the favor, some
observers believe. The Saudi leadership plays along with suggestions it
may acquire nuclear technology from Pakistan. In March 2015, King Salman
bin Abdulaziz urgently summoned Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to
Riyadh to discuss strategic cooperation efforts, while calling for
Pakistani involvement in Saudi efforts in Yemen. This was intended to
remind nuclear weapons state negotiators that Riyadh is keeping its
nuclear options open. But **[[it is unlikely the Saudis will get a
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [from Pakistan.
Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}**---which covertly developed its nuclear
arsenal outside the nuclear nonproliferation regime---**[[aims to
normalize]{.mark} its nuclear status, [rather than becoming further
alienated]{.mark} from the international community]{.underline}**.
Islamabad was already singled out for the activities of the world\'s
biggest and most successful illicit nuclear trafficking network, led by
a key figure in its nuclear weapons program, A.Q. Khan. What's more,
Islamabad is extremely proud of its nuclear achievements. In the words
of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, "We will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will
get one of our own \[bomb\]." Pakistanis didn't eat grass, but they
endured a great deal of hardship to get the bomb. **[The program was
extremely costly for the country. So, it's no surprise that many
Pakistani officials and former officials take issue with assertions that
their country might give nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia. Even if
Pakistan agreed to provide the Kingdom with the bomb, the Saudis are
very unlikely to go through with such an acquisition.]{.underline}**
Saudi Arabia is dependent on the United States for security guarantees.
**[As long as [Washington]{.mark} remains Riyadh's main security
guarantor, it [has the power to influence Saudi decision making]{.mark}
on other issues, including, specifically, nuclear weapon
acquisition]{.underline}**. And **[[the Kingdom would find it very
difficult to attract another country willing to supply the security and
trade]{.mark} guarantees that the United States now provides. It is hard
to imagine any of the world\'s major powers agreeing to be viewed as a
supporter of nuclear proliferation.]{.underline}** It is reasonably
likely that Saudi Arabia will continue its efforts to develop a civilian
nuclear program. Saudi Arabia recently signed a nuclear cooperation
agreement with South Korea to explore the feasibility of building two
nuclear reactors in the Kingdom. Moving forward with South Korea as the
main supplier raises a key issue: Washington says that Seoul's reactors
are US designs, and that, if that technology is to be sold, the
countries acquiring it must enter into nuclear cooperation contracts
(known as 123 agreements, because they are based on Section 123 of the
US Atomic Energy Act) with the United States. Although South Korea
disputes the need for a 123 agreement, **[if Saudi Arabia does agree to
enter into such a pact, it could well mean a ban on enrichment and
reprocessing in the Kingdom, closing domestic paths to the
bomb.]{.underline}** Riyadh could of course acquire nuclear technology
from the two other countries that have developed nuclear power plants on
an international basis, France and Russia. **[But given Paris's hardline
stance on nonproliferation, it's unlikely to oblige an effort by Saudi
Arabia to develop the enrichment or reprocessing capabilities needed to
produce fissile material in the Kingdom]{.underline}**.
**[[Moscow]{.mark}, too, [would think twice before allowing Riyadh to go
nuclear]{.mark}, particularly given the competition between the two
countries in world petroleum markets and their divergence on regional
security matters.]{.underline}**

Of the many unnerving aspects of the future of the Middle East, a
nuclear arms race would top the list. And to feed that unease, **[Saudi
Arabia has been]{.underline}** periodically **[dropping
hints]{.underline}** that, should Iran's nuclear ambitions go unchecked,
**[it might]{.underline}** just **[have to get nuclear weapons
itself.]{.underline}** This week, the Saudi ambassador to London made
yet another explicit threat, warning that "all options will be on the
table."∂ **[Oh, please! [Saudi Arabia isn't going to build a
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon.]{.underline}** **[[Saudi Arabia can't]{.mark}
build a nuclear weapon.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia hasn't even built a
car. (By 2017, after much effort, the country is expected to manufacture
its first automobile.)∂ **[Saudi Arabia can dig holes in the ground and
pump out oil but little else. Oil revenue is]{.underline}** about **[45
percent of its g]{.underline}**ross **[d]{.underline}**omestic
**[p]{.underline}**roduct, a staggeringly high figure, much larger than
petro-states such as Nigeria and Venezuela. It makes up almost 90
percent of the Saudi government's revenue. Despite decades of massive
government investment, lavish subsidies and cheap energy,
**[manufacturing is less than 10 percent of Saudi GDP.]{.underline}**∂
**[[Where would Saudi Arabia train the scientists]{.mark} to work on its
secret program? [The country's education system is backward]{.mark} and
dysfunctional, having been]{.underline}** largely **[handed over to
its]{.underline}** puritanical and reactionary **[religious
establishment]{.underline}**. The country ranks 73rd in the quality of
its math and science education, according to the World Economic Forum
--- abysmally low for a rich country. Iran, despite 36 years of
sanctions and a much lower per capita GDP, fares far better at 44.∂ And
**[[who would work]{.mark} in Saudi Arabia's imagined nuclear
industry?]{.underline}** In a penetrating book, Karen Elliott House,
formerly of the Wall Street Journal, describes the Saudi labor market:
"**[One of every three people in Saudi Arabia is a foreigner. [Two out
of every three people with a job]{.mark}]{.underline}** of any sort
**[[are foreign]{.mark}. And in Saudi Arabia's anemic private
sector]{.underline}**, fully **[nine out of ten people holding jobs are
non-Saudi]{.underline}**. . . . Saudi Arabia, in short, is a society in
which all too many men do not want to work at jobs for which they are
qualified; in which women by and large aren't allowed to work; and in
which, as a result, most of the work is done by foreigners."∂ None of
this is to suggest that the kingdom is in danger of collapse. Far from
it. The regime's finances are strong, though public spending keeps
rising and oil revenue has been declining. **[The royal
family]{.underline}** has deftly used patronage, politics, religion and
repression to keep the country stable and quiescent. But that **[has
produced a system of stagnation for most]{.underline}**, with a gilded
elite surfing on top with almost unimaginable sums of money.∂ Saudi
Arabia's increased assertiveness has been portrayed as strategic. In
fact, it is a panicked and emotional response to Iran, fueled in no
small measure by long-standing anti-Shiite bigotry. It is pique
masquerading as strategy. In October 2013, after having spent years and
millions of dollars campaigning for a seat on the U.N. Security Council,
it abruptly declined the post at the last minute, signaling that it was
annoyed at U.S. policy in its region.∂ Its most recent international
activism, the air campaign in Yemen, has badly backfired. Bruce Riedel,
a former top White House aide, says that damage to civilians and
physical infrastructure "has created considerable bad blood between
Yemenis and their rich Gulf neighbors that will poison relations for
years. Yemenis always resented their rich brothers, and now many will
want revenge." He notes that the air campaign is being directed by the
new defense minister, the king's 29-year-old son, who has no experience
in military affairs or much else.∂ **[But [couldn't Saudi Arabia]{.mark}
simply [buy a]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear bomb?]{.underline}** **[That's
highly [unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Any]{.mark} such [effort
would]{.mark} have to [take place]{.mark} secretly, [under]{.mark} the
[threat of sanctions]{.mark}, Western [retaliation and interception.
Saudi Arabia depends heavily on foreigners]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
their firms **[to help with its energy industry, build its
infrastructure, buy its oil and sell it goods and services. [Were it
isolated]{.mark} like Iran or North Korea, [its economic system would
collapse]{.mark}.∂]{.underline}** **[It is often claimed that Pakistan
would sell nukes to the Saudis.]{.underline}** And it's true that the
Saudis have bailed out Pakistan many times. **[But the government in
[Islamabad is well aware]{.mark} that [such a deal could make it a
pariah and result in sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[It is
unlikely to risk that]{.mark}, even to please]{.underline}** its sugar
daddy in **[Riyadh. In April, Pakistan refused repeated Saudi pleas to
join the air campaign in Yemen.]{.underline}**∂ So let me make a
prediction: **[Whatever happens]{.underline}** with Iran's nuclear
program, **[10 years from now Saudi Arabia won't have nuclear weapons.

**[[None]{.mark} of these states [have expressed an interest in
reprocessing, which closes the plutonium path to the bomb]{.mark}. Some
have]{.underline}** even **[foregone enrichment, which blocks the
uranium path to the bomb.]{.underline}** That's the case for the UAE.
But **[some states, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and Turkey,
**[want to reserve "the right" to enrich.]{.underline}** Riyadh went
further and stated it wanted whatever Iran got out of the negotiations,
including enrichment.∂ **[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Turkey,
Egypt, Jordan and the UAE **[are]{.underline}** all [**[dependent on
foreign suppliers and expertise for their programs.]{.underline}**
**[They lack]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [human capacity]{.mark} for

difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though not impossible, **[[to]{.mark}
covertly [develop a]{.mark} nuclear [weapon.]{.mark} This means that
suppliers]{.underline}** also **[need to do their due diligence and
ensure]{.underline}** that **[buyers use their equipment for purely
peaceful purposes.∂]{.underline}** One explanation as to why Tehran went
so far in developing its indigenous nuclear technology, including
enrichment, is that international suppliers weren't as involved and
reliable after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Following the revolution,
Iran's original suppliers, the United States, France and Germany, dumped
the country, which then looked East. It went to Pakistan, including the
illicit nuclear procurement network led by Pakistan's A.Q. Khan, Russia
and China. But Iran's government believed it could not rely on any of
these partners. Without a strong involvement in its program by foreign
suppliers committed to nonproliferation, Iran was able to pursue
indigenous nuclear technology. This diminished the international
community's leverage on Tehran.∂ The Iranian context, however, is
different from other countries in the region, which depend on the West
and U.S. allies for their nuclear programs. **[Today's [nuclear
newcomers must comply with]{.mark}]{.underline}** certain
**[[international requirements]{.mark} for their programs to be
completed by]{.underline}** these **[suppliers. This means that
[suppliers can]{.mark}]{.underline}** and should try to
**[[limit]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[further [prolif]{.mark}eration
of enrichment and reprocessing.∂]{.underline}** But **[technical
constraints aside, there are political obstacles to the proliferation
cascade theory.]{.underline}** **[Countries like]{.underline}** Turkey

security.]{.underline}** [**[Washington can leverage this influence to

#### Won't prolif -- international pressure

**Lippman 2018**

of Saudi Arabia on the Edge: The Uncertain Future of an American Ally
"Does Saudi Arabia Intend to Develop a Nuclear Weapons Capability?"
https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/75723

Speculation about Saudi Arabia's possible desire to acquire or develop
nuclear weapons has arisen periodically since 1988, when the Saudis
secretly acquired nuclear-capable Chinese missiles. Now that Saudi
Arabia is pressing ahead with its plans to build civilian nuclear power
plants, the speculation has predictably intensified.

In reality, [Saudi Arabia is highly unlikely to seek nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, **[no matter what becomes of Iran's nuclear
program]{.underline}**, [because]{.underline} [the negative
consequences]{.underline} of doing so [would far outweigh any
conceivable strategic gain.]{.underline} The kingdom, [a signatory to
the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]{.underline}, [has tied its future
to **full integration**]{.underline} [with the]{.underline} **[global
economic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [industrial
system]{.underline}. [It cannot afford]{.underline} the [international
ostracism]{.underline} that [nuclear proliferation would
bring.]{.underline}

Moreover, [the Saudis know that they have few friends in the U.S.
Congress.]{.underline} [Any sign]{.underline} that [the]{.underline}
[kingdom was moving toward nuclear weapons]{.underline} [would end U.S.
arms sales]{.underline} [and terminate the strategic
relationship]{.underline} [that has long ensured the kingdom's
security]{.underline}.

**[Wanting enrichment is a far cry from possessing it]{.underline}**,
however. **[How would the Saudis acquire enrichment
technology?]{.underline}** **[Their]{.underline}** nascent nuclear
**[industry is]{.underline}** at a **[rudimentary]{.underline}** stage.
**[They have no facilities]{.underline}** relating to enrichment and no

**[Developing]{.underline}** uranium
**[[enrichment]{.underline}]{.mark}** on their own **[[would take 15
years]{.underline}]{.mark}** or more. If they really want to match
Iran's enrichment programme, they naturally would want to buy the
technology, but **[who would sell it?]{.underline}** The 49 members of
the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) have agreed not to transfer any
nuclear technology that would contribute to the proliferation of nuclear
weapons. There is no standard interpretation of this clause, but clearly
it would apply to a Saudi enrichment programme that was initiated to
contribute to a weapons option. Although the NSG guidelines are
voluntary, the 'non-proliferation principle', as it is called, has
become an entrenched norm. Any inclination to violate it would put the
would-be exporter under intense international pressure. Five nations
that possess enrichment technology are outside the NSG: India, Iran,
Israel, Pakistan and North Korea. **[Iran obviously would not empower
its Gulf rival]{.underline}** in this way, and neither would Israel.
**[India]{.underline}**, which seeks NSG membership, prides itself on
not allowing proliferation-sensitive exports and **[has strong reasons
to keep its export record clean]{.underline}**. **[[North

a nuclear energy program with other members of the Gulf Cooperation

### Prolif D

#### No impact to proliferation or rogue states.

HOW ABOUT PROLIFERATION AND TERRORISM?

Great powers are one thing, some might say, but [rogue states or
terrorist groups]{.underline} are another. [If they go
nuclear]{.underline}, [it's game over]{.underline}---which is why any
further proliferation must be prevented by all possible measures, up to
and including war.

[That logic might seem]{.underline} **[plausible at
first]{.underline}**, **[but it breaks down]{.underline}** [on close
examination]{.underline}. Not only has [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[already survived]{.mark} the [acquisition]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[of nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by]{.mark} some of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[craziest mass murderers]{.mark} in
history]{.underline}** (**[Stalin and Mao]{.underline}**),
[but]{.underline} **[[proliferation has slowed
down]{.underline}]{.mark}** [rather than sped up over time]{.underline}.
[**[Dozens]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[technologically]{.mark}
[sophisticated countries have]{.mark}]{.underline} [[considered]{.mark}
obtaining [nuclear arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [[very few have]{.mark} done so]{.underline}.
This is [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} [[nuclear weapons]{.mark} [turn
out to be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[difficult and
expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to acquire [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[strategically]{.underline} **[[provocative]{.mark} to
possess]{.underline}**.

[[They have]{.underline}]{.mark} [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[proved to enhance status]{.mark} much]{.underline}, as many expected
they would. [Pakistan and Russia may]{.underline} [garner more
attention]{.underline} today than they would without nukes, [but would
Japan's prestige be increased if it became nuclear?]{.underline} Did
[China's status improve when it went nuclear]{.underline}---**[or when
its economy grew?]{.underline}** [And [would anybody really
care]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[[or even notice]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[if the current British or French nuclear arsenal was doubled or
halved?]{.underline}

**[[Alarmists]{.underline}]{.mark}** [have [misjudged]{.mark} not only
[the pace of proliferation]{.mark} [but also its
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Proliferation]{.mark} is incredibly
dangerous]{.underline} and necessary to prevent, [we are
told]{.underline}, [because]{.underline} [going nuclear [would]{.mark}
**[supposedly empower rogue states]{.mark}** [and lead them to
dominate]{.mark} [their region]{.mark}]{.underline}. The details of how
this domination would happen are rarely discussed, but [the general idea
seems to be that once a country has nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [it
can use them to threaten others and get its way]{.underline}, [with
nonnuclear countries deferring or paying ransom to the local bully out
of fear]{.underline}.

**[[Except]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of course, [that in three-quarters of
a century]{.underline}, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has never been able to get anything]{.mark} close to that obedience
from anybody]{.underline}, **[even when it had a nuclear
monopoly]{.underline}**. [So [why should it be true
for]{.mark}]{.underline}, [say]{.underline}, **[[Iran or North
Korea?]{.underline}]{.mark}** [It is]{.underline} **[[far more
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that a nuclear rogue's
threats]{.underline} [[would cause]{.mark} its [rivals
to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[join together]{.mark} against the
provocateur]{.underline}**---[just as countries around the Persian Gulf
responded to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait]{.underline} [by closing ranks
to oppose]{.underline}, **[[rather than acquiescing]{.mark}
in]{.underline}**, [his effort at domination]{.underline}.

## Case

#### Weapons sales lock in arms racing and destabilizes Saudi Arabia

**Hartung 2010**

September 24, 2010 William Hartung, Director of the Arms and Security
Initiative, New America Foundation Deborah Jerome, Interviewer "Is Big
Saudi Arms Sale a Good Idea?"
https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea

On the face of it, the proposed arms deal with Saudi Arabia is a win-win
situation: The United States gets jobs at a time of high unemployment;
Saudi Arabia gets to bolster its military and further cement its
relationship with its main protector; and Israel gets the promise of
equipment superior to anything transferred to the Saudis. Best of all,
say the deal's advocates, it sends a signal to Iran that the United
States and its Persian Gulf allies will not be intimidated.

Or so it would seem. But the reality is much more complicated. First, to
the extent that the deal is about jobs, as Boeing and the Obama
administration claim, that is the wrong criterion for making a major
arms sale.

Security considerations must come first. And on this front, there are
serious questions that have not been addressed by the boosters of the
deal. [By throwing weapons at Saudi Arabia with one hand while giving
them to Israel with the other]{.underline}, [are we not simply arming
both sides **of a nascent arms race**? Is Iran likely to be
cowed]{.underline} [by the Saudi mega-deal, or will it simply seek a way
to **ratchet up its own military** **capabilities**?]{.underline}

Is the Middle East really suffering from a dearth of advanced weaponry?
[In the past three years alone]{.underline}, [the United States has
offered over \$30 billion in armaments to Persian Gulf
states]{.underline}, [counterbalanced by offers of a similar amount to
Israel.]{.underline} [The United Kingdom and Russia have supplied
billions more]{.underline} to the Persian Gulf states. [Attempting to
create a balance at higher and higher levels of weaponry]{.underline}
**[is both dangerous and unnecessary.]{.underline}**

In addition, **[how stable is Saudi Arabia?]{.underline}** In the short
run, there may be no major cause for concern, but the [combat planes,
helicopters, missiles, and bombs]{.underline} [that are part of the deal
will last for decades]{.underline}. [Would anyone have
predicted]{.underline} in the mid-1970s that [the]{.underline} heavily
armed regime of the [Shah of Iran would be toppled by]{.underline} a
group of [Islamic fundamentalists?]{.underline}

[The Saudi deal]{.underline} will no doubt go through, but it shouldn't.
It [consists primarily of offensive weapons]{.underline}\--fighter
planes, attack helicopters, and guided bombs\--[that serve no
constructive purpose]{.underline}. [Fighter planes]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [guided bombs aren't relevant to
addressing]{.underline} the potential threat posed by [Iranian
missiles,]{.underline} nor [are they likely to dissuade Iran from
developing nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [Combat aircraft and attack
helicopters]{.underline} [might be used in Saudi strikes against
terrorists]{.underline} [and separatist groups]{.underline} in northern
Yemen, [but doing so would be **counterproductive**]{.underline},
**[more likely to inflame passions against Riyadh]{.underline}** than to
solve its border security problems.

Congress and the public should think twice before signing off on what
may be the first stage of a new Mideast arms race.

### UQ

#### Influence over arms sales collapsing now -- short term withdrawal of weapons is key to prevent domestic Saudi arms industry

**Stratfor 2018**

Stratfor American geopolitical intelligence platform and publisher Nov
9, 2018 "Saudi Arabia Lays the Foundation for a Defense Industry of Its
Own"
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/saudi-arabia-defense-industry-weapons-imports-vision2030

Saudi Arabia, flush with money, nestled in a hostile environment and
saddled with demographic shortcomings, has long spent freely to bring in
weapons from abroad. And over the past five years, driven by its
intensifying competition with archrival Iran and a heavy military
commitment in the Yemen conflict, this trend has accelerated. During the
period of 2013-17, the number of arms systems the Saudi government
purchased grew by 255 percent compared with its acquisitions from
2008-12, ranking it behind only India among global arms importers,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

[As Saudi Arabia pursues its regional interests,]{.underline}
[it]{.underline} **[has increasingly sought to insulate
itself]{.underline}** [from outside influence.]{.underline} [To guard
against dependence on arms imports,]{.underline} [which could subject it
to political pressure, it has worked to build up the capabilities of its
own defense industry]{.underline}. This shift in philosophy comes as the
kingdom\'s usual arms suppliers increasingly reconsider the extent of
their weapons trade with Riyadh because of mounting casualties from
Yemen\'s civil war and outrage over the apparent murder of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Besides lessening dependence on foreign
weapons sources, [a mature local defense industry could also play a key
role in diversifying the Saudi economy]{.underline} [while Riyadh is
working to ease its overreliance on energy exports.]{.underline} If the
Saudi defense sector can be successfully built out, it could provide
jobs for a large number of citizens and help address concerns about
growing unemployment.

Building the Base for a Defense Industry

[Saudi aspirations for an indigenous defense industry are certainly
ambitious]{.underline}. [In its overarching Saudi Vision 2030 economic
strategy, Riyadh wants to produce locally at least half of the equipment
it will need for security and military use]{.underline} by 2030. To move
toward that goal, [when Saudi Arabia negotiates]{.underline} [major arms
contracts]{.underline} with trade partners, [it increasingly
insists]{.underline} that [component manufacturing]{.underline} [and
final assembly be done in the kingdom]{.underline}.

Riyadh has also overhauled some parts of the government structure to
oversee the growth of its defense industry. For instance, [the General
Authority for Military Industries was created]{.underline} in 2017 [to
coordinate]{.underline} [weapons procurement]{.underline} [and research
and development]{.underline} **[with an emphasis on local
sourcing.]{.underline}** In the same year, [Saudi Arabian Military
Industries (SAMI),]{.underline} **[a state-owned defense
company]{.underline}** with a focus on aeronautics, land weapons
systems, missiles and defense electronics, all areas of heavy Saudi
need, [was founded]{.underline}. SAMI\'s lofty goals include the
creation of more than 40,000 direct and 100,000 indirect jobs in the
country by 2030, which, by then, it hopes would add more than \$3.7
billion to the kingdom\'s annual gross domestic product, which stood at
about \$684 billion in 2017.

\[chart omitted\]

[Saudi Arabia already has made concrete progress in building its defense
industrial base]{.underline}. Large [Western defense companies employ
thousands of Saudis at their plants in the kingdom]{.underline}.
[Two-thirds of the workers employed by BAE Systems to assemble the Hawk
trainer jets it sold to Riyadh]{.underline}, for instance, [are Saudi
citizens]{.underline}. In March 2018, [Boeing and SAMI
formed]{.underline} [a joint venture partnership]{.underline} w[ith the
goal of localizing 55 percent of the service and maintenance
work]{.underline} done on Boeing aircraft [sold to the
kingdom]{.underline} by 2030. According to Boeing, this would create
6,000 jobs or training opportunities for Saudi youths.

Wrinkles in the System

[While Saudi Arabia]{.underline} [has]{.underline}
[certainly]{.underline} [laid the groundwork]{.underline} for its
defense industry [and has made some early progress]{.underline} in
developing it, **[guiding the sector to maturity will be no simple
matter]{.underline}**. [It is one thing to]{.underline} [agree on paper
to]{.underline} significant [technology transfers]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [local job creation]{.underline}, [but it is another
to effectively implement such deals]{.underline}.
[Struggles]{.underline} [by defense companies to satisfy
stipulations]{.underline} [within pending]{.underline}
[agreements]{.underline} that mandate local sourcing of services and raw
materials [have led to contract delays]{.underline}. It has also proved
particularly difficult for defense companies with well-established and
staffed manufacturing plants in the United States and Europe to set up
assembly lines in Saudi Arabia, despite the relative simplicity of
assembly compared with full manufacturing.

[A particular problem]{.underline} those [companies have run into has
been in finding a sufficient number of Saudis]{.underline} [who
have]{.underline} both the [necessary technical skills]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the [willingness to work on a factory
floor]{.underline}. The [shortcomings]{.underline} [of the Saudi
educational system]{.underline} have [forced defense
companies]{.underline} [to conduct their own staff
training]{.underline}, [causing delays and adding costs]{.underline}. In
fact, the choice of who would lead SAMI provides an illustrative point
of the larger issue. Taking the helm as CEO of the state-owned defense
company was not a Saudi, but rather Andreas Schwer, a German citizen and
former head of combat systems at Rheinmetall AG.

Moving Away From the U.S. and Europe

Beyond the long-term strategy of making its own equipment, [Saudi Arabia
has also weighed the option of diversifying weapons purchases away from
U.S. and European states]{.underline}, which currently satisfy the bulk
of Saudi demand. [Such an approach]{.underline} not only [would
allow]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia to reduce]{.underline} its
[dependence]{.underline} [on the United States]{.underline} and the
European Union, [but could also give Riyadh]{.underline}
[access]{.underline} [to countries more willing to overlook its track
record on human rights]{.underline} [and to offer generous technology
transfer rights as part of contracts]{.underline}. The kingdom, for
instance, has opened negotiations with Russia over the purchase of the
S-400 surface-to-air missile system in hopes that Moscow would offer a
deal better than the U.S. offers on its Terminal High-Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) system. And Saudi Arabia has purchased large numbers of
armed drones from China as the United States continues to refuse to sell
such technology to countries in the region.

While there are certainly potential benefits for the Saudis in
diversifying arms sources, there are considerable limits as well. For
one thing, [**neither Russia nor China is in the position to replace the
United States** as a present and powerful guarantor of Saudi security
against Iran]{.underline}. Even [more important]{.underline}, [because
the Saudi military is equipped chiefly with Western weapons, a major
forcewide shift toward non-Western equipment would **create serious
logistical**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[training
problems]{.underline}** in a force already not well-known for its
maintenance capabilities or its professional acumen. For those reasons,
[the Saudi state will have no choice but to continue to rely on its
alliances with the United State]{.underline}s and, to a lesser extent,
European states. [This will extend to its arms-purchasing relationship
as well.]{.underline}

Even in the best of cases, the Saudi defense industry will not be
developed enough to give it full independence in weapons sourcing even
by 2030. Considering the industry\'s current underdeveloped state, even
if it matures considerably, the kingdom will still have to look abroad
for the high-tech weaponry it desires. Saudi Arabia thus will have no
choice but to continue to rely on arms imports in the coming years, but
that dependence will not preclude it from following an increasingly
independent course. Furthermore, given the limits of the kingdom\'s
strategy to find other sources of weapons, Riyadh will remain keen to
maintain its significant relationship with Western powers, particularly
the United States.
