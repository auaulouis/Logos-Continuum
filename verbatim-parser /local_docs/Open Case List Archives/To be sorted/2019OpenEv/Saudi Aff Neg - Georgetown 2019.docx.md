#### Continued US sales to Saudi Arabia constitute a deliberate sponsorship of autocracy.

[THE UNITED States' perennially controversial relationship with the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been rocked]{.underline} over the past few
weeks [by the]{.underline} explosive allegation that the Saudi
authorities orchestrated the [killing of]{.underline} Washington Post
journalist Jamal [Khashoggi]{.underline}. According to Turkish
government sources, on 2 October 2018, Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi
government, was murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul by a hit squad that Riyadh had dispatched prior to his
scheduled meeting at the facility.

Although this news has unleashed an international media frenzy and
sparked a bipartisan outcry in the US Congress, [the Trump
administration's reaction has been conspicuously low-key.]{.underline}
Most notably, President Donald **[Trump has refused to suspend tens of
billions of dollars' worth of planned arms sales to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**. According to the president, not only would such a
move be economically "foolish", but even more importantly, it would also
jeopardise America\'s geopolitical interests in the Middle East, where
"Saudi Arabia has been a very important ally of ours". [Trump's
reluctance to interfere with the flow of arms to Riyadh is particularly
concerning in light of credible reports that since its 2015 invasion of
Yemen, the US-armed Saudi military has engaged in a ghastly range of
horrific attacks against Yemeni civilians.]{.underline}

Several critics have attributed [Trump's position to idiosyncratic
factors, such as the president's peculiar affinity for dictators, his
enmity towards the media, or the Trump Organisation's rumoured
indebtedness to the Saudis]{.underline}. While these possibilities
cannot be ruled out, it nevertheless bears noting that all US
presidential administrations since the end of World War II have
downplayed and ignored Saudi Arabia's consistently wretched human rights
record.

[In doing so, they were able to ensure sufficient domestic support to
enlist and retain the oil-rich kingdom as an ally of convenience against
a succession of shared adversaries.]{.underline} These have included the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, Gamel Abdel Nasser's Egypt during the
1960's, revolutionary Iran during the 1980's, Saddam Hussein's Iraq
during the 1990's, Al Qaeda after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and most
recently, both the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Iran
again.

More broadly, [during times of extreme danger to US national security,
American presidents have exhibited extraordinary cynicism in
whitewashing some of modern history's most barbarous massacres by their
autocratic alliance partners]{.underline}. To take just one especially
infamous example, at the height of World War II, President Franklin
Roosevelt quashed appeals by the Polish government-in-exile in London to
investigate the mass slaughter of over 20,000 Polish officers at the
Katyn Forest in April 1940 by America's Soviet ally.

#### The threats used to justify continued involvement are constructed and inform a faulty approach to foreign policy.

By contrast, [the current geopolitical stakes for the US in the Middle
East are low]{.underline}. First, [Saudi Arabia's envious position as
the world's most important "swing producer" of oil has
deteriorated]{.underline} over the last several years owing to the
increased diversification of global oil production. This deterioration
is most dramatically underscored by the US' recent displacement of the
Kingdom as the world's leading oil producer.

Second, [the jihadi terrorist threat that has emanated from the Middle
East (and which Saudi Arabia did much to engender), has receded
dramatically owing to the annihilation of Al Qaeda and ISIS at the hands
of the US military and its allies]{.underline}. Third, [although
brokering on-again, off-again peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians has been a high US priority since the early 1990's, neither
Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territories nor Palestinian
terrorism against Israelis constitute even a serious threat to the
security of the US.]{.underline}

Even [the most compelling geopolitical rationale for maintaining the
alliance with the Saudis, namely, the need to contain Iran, is
dubious.]{.underline} Over the course of its nearly two years in office,
[the Trump administration has relentlessly demonised Iran for its
interventionism in Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, as well as Tehran\'s
proliferation of ballistic missiles and undiminished support for proxies
such as Hezbollah and Hamas.]{.underline}

[These hostile activities belie the reality that Iran remains a weak,
underdeveloped state that can be readily counterbalanced by its many
surrounding enemies]{.underline}. These include all of the Sunni Arab
states, as well as the Middle East's predominant military power, Israel,
which possesses the region's only nuclear arsenal. To wit, according to
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, [Iran's US\$14
billion military budget in 2017]{.underline} (as measured in constant
2016 US dollars), [was dwarfed by the combined defence spending of its
two foremost regional enemies of Saudi Arabia and Israel]{.underline},
which amounted to \$85 billion.

#### Ending arms sales serves as a functional check on emboldening of authoritarianism and militarism 

Steven **Feldstein 18** {Frank and Bethine Church Chair of Public
Affairs at Boise State University. "Trump, Saudi Arabia and the
Khashoggi Case: What Would Obama Have Done?", *Boise State Department of
Public Policy and Administration*,

Published 11/28/18, Accessed 6/19/19} //RG

[It is hard to imagine Obama publicly contradicting a high-level
intelligence report from the CIA pinning culpability on the Saudis, as
President Trump has done]{.underline}. In fact, it is highly unlikely
that such an intelligence leak would have happened at all under Obama's
watch -- he always gave serious attention to recommendations from his
bureaucracy. Second, Obama would have pursued a more nuanced approach by
making more deliberate use of existing diplomatic and economic tools to
signal concern to the Saudis. [President Trump asserts that the U.S.
either had to cut ties with Saudi or give them a free pass. **That is a
false choice**.]{.underline}

[The U.S. has many intermediate measures at its disposal -- such as
**halting arms sales** and increasingly punitive sanctions]{.underline}.
Obama would have taken fuller advantage of these instruments. Third,
while Obama would have taken pains to preserve the relationship, he
would have quietly sent [a franker message to Saudi Arabia: Such
behavior is intolerable, there must be accountability and this cannot
happen again.]{.underline} For example, in response to the execution of
47 prisoners, former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes
recalls, "In blunt language, Obama protested these actions, and warned
the king that Saudi Arabia's human-rights record was going to bring
greater international isolation."

[What Obama would not have done is publicly assert that the only values
worth defending are national interests. And that powerful -- and rich --
countries will receive preferential treatment from the U.S. even if they
commit egregious human rights violations such as murder.]{.underline}
Trump has unmistakably set the U.S. down a road that breaks longstanding
foreign policy precedent. [His implicit endorsement of Saudi Arabia's
reckless behavior runs the risk of emboldening other leaders to pursue
similar policies.]{.underline} And [Trump's basis for letting Saudi
Arabia off the hook -- its strategic importance -- is shaky. Many
experts rightly point out that Saudi's usefulness to the U.S. is limited
and Saudi's regional standing is exceptionally dependent on U.S.
support. So why give away U.S. leverage for free and dispense with
decades of policy precedence based on a flimsy premise?]{.underline}
That is something only Trump can answer.

#### Saudi's militarism collapses mid-east stability 

Pieter D. **Wezeman 18** {Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms
Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme, "Saudi Arabia, armaments
and conflict in the Middle East," *SIPRI*,
<https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2018/saudi-arabia-armaments-and-conflict-middle-east>,
Published 12/14/18, Accessed 6/22/19} //RG

[Lack of transparency in military matters makes it difficult to
determine the extent to which Saudi Arabia's high levels of military
spending and arms procurement are driven by defensive or offensive
motives, military or prestige considerations, internal power play or the
possibility for government officials to enrich themselves. However, it
is clear that Saudi Arabia is no longer just stocking up on weapons. It
is actually using them on a large scale in]{.underline} an offensive
operation in [Yemen. Preparations for]{.underline} the [future
use]{.underline} of armed force elsewhere [should not be excluded as a
motive]{.underline} for the continuing high level of militarization.

[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia might perceive its failure to win the war in
Yemen as an indication of the limitations of its military arsenal. On
the other hand, it [could perceive the operations in Yemen as preventing
a complete takeover of Yemen by allies of Iran, forcing the Houthi
rebels to agree on negotiations and providing an opportunity for its
armed forces to gain significant experience of warfare.]{.underline}
Such perceptions combined with further arms acquisitions that enhance
the reach and strike power of its armed forces may embolden the Saudi
leadership to view the use of force as an increasingly central part of
its foreign policy, regional power aspirations and responses to real or
perceived threats from, among others, Iran, Qatar, or internal groups.

[As Yemen dramatically illustrates, there are **major risks for national
and regional security, stability, peace, development and the
humanitarian situation that relate to militarized foreign and security
policies in the Middle East**]{.underline}. [States should therefore
reassess the possible short- and long-term consequences of their arms
exports to Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, ensure that a questionable
narrative of economic gain does not drive such arms sales and consider
if and how arms supplies can have a role at all in conflict resolution
in the Middle East.

#### Arms sales are the lynchpin of aggressive Saudi behavior -- answers their alternative causality arguments

First, [arms sales to belligerents in a conflict are seldom a decisive
factor, but rather invite a counterreaction by opposing states, thereby
feeding civil wars rather than extinguishing them]{.underline}. U.S. and
European [supply to the Saudi-Emirati intervention in Yemen has
coincided with Iran's increased support for its Houthi
partners]{.underline}.17 The provision of weapons by the United States
and several Gulf states to Syrian rebels initially helped to tip the
balance against the Syrian army. But this same support also encouraged
Iran to escalate its support, and once it became clear that the Obama
administration would not take direct military action against the Syrian
armed forces, Russia seized an opening to intervene and defeat those
same rebels, thereby decisively changing the contours of the conflict.

Even worse, [arms provided to militaries in fragile or highly corrupt
states can slip into the hands of terrorists, militias, and other
nonstate actors]{.underline}. Although [the Houthi rebels
have]{.underline} reportedly received Iranian-supplied ballistic
missiles, many of their [ballistic missile stocks]{.underline} are
[composed of Russian and North Korean weapons originally provided to the
Yemeni army]{.underline} and seized during Houthi advances in 2013 and
2014.18 A comprehensive survey by Conflict Armament Research of 40,000
combat items recovered from [Islamic State]{.underline} fighters in
Syria and Iraq suggests that [more than 50 percent of their weapons were
originally produced by Russia and China]{.underline} (many of them for
the Syrian and Iraqi armies), and 30 percent originated from Warsaw
Pact--era Eastern Europe. Three percent of weapons and 13 percent of
ammunition were NATO caliber, presumably seized from the Iraqi armed
forces during the Islamic State's advances in 2014.19

In one case, an advanced anti-tank guided weapon was reportedly
manufactured in Europe, sold to the United States, supplied to a party
in Syria, and transferred to the Islamic State in Iraq, where it was
recovered---all within two months of leaving the factory.20
Unfortunately, the advanced weapons systems being sold to authoritarian
Arab governments today may be used by insurgent fighters in future wars.

[What of the argument that security assistance and arms sales can
moderate the behavior of recipient countries?]{.underline}21 Here too,
[experience suggests otherwise]{.underline}. Take the examples of U.S.
security assistance to Egypt and U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates.

The United States has provided \$1.3 billion in security assistance to
Egypt annually since the 1978 Camp David Accords, totaling more than
\$46 billion.22 While the hope had been that the assistance would help
modernize, professionalize, and depoliticize Egypt's military, in fact
the opposite has happened. In 2013, then defense minister (now
President) Abdel Fattah el-Sisi upended a brief democratic opening, and
since then the military domination of politics and the economy has
escalated sharply. Gross human rights abuses have also risen, fueling an
insurgency in Sinai and radicalization among youth in prisons. The
United States has struggled to use its assistance as leverage; the Obama
and Trump administrations each suspended portions of assistance or
equipment deliveries due to alarming rights violations and lack of
cooperation in other forms, but then gave up and resumed aid without
getting anything in return. Any potential political leverage was thus
forfeited.

A review of 2017 U.S. arms sales found at least [\$659 million in sales
to Saudi Arabia and the U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab
[E]{.underline}mirates [for laser-guided bombs and other munitions, as
well as firearms, to be used in combat operations in
Yemen]{.underline}.23 But [there is little evidence that the U.S.
support for the Saudi-Emirati campaign has either accelerated a
coalition victory]{.underline} (thereby shortening the conflict) [or
significantly reduced casualties in Yemen]{.underline}. U.S.-made
[weapons systems have targeted school buses, funerals, and
hospitals.]{.underline}24 Four years into the war, [the situation has
been called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world]{.underline},
with millions of Yemenis at risk of starvation or suffering from related
diseases. Germany and Spain have cut off weapons sales to the
intervening parties, and pressure has grown in the United Kingdom and
United States to consider doing likewise, particularly after an August
2018 United Nations report found that practices by both sides in the
conflict amounted to war crimes.25

[Interoperability has also proved to be something of a
mirage]{.underline}. The United States and its allies have cooperated in
some cases with Arab militaries on common goals: the 1991 Gulf War to
expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the 2011 intervention in Libya, and the
more recent war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But
[increasingly, Arab militaries are using weapons, technology, and
training obtained from the West to conduct interventions not necessarily
to the West's liking]{.underline}---such as the Gulf force that crushed
a peaceful Bahraini uprising in 2011, the ongoing Saudi-Emirati campaign
in Yemen, and the ongoing Egyptian-Emirati intervention on behalf of
General Khalifa Haftar in Libya.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

[Establish new arms sales parameters: The United States and its European
allies should reconsider the circumstances in which they provide weapons
to Middle Eastern states---as well as their unseemly rivalry in doing
so. Such weapons inflame conflicts and lead to direct threats to their
collective security through migration and terrorism.]{.underline} To
reduce the likelihood of weapons slipping into the hands of nonstate
actors, they should severely restrict the sale of advanced weapons
systems to fragile states at risk for future internal conflicts. [They
should also reduce sales to states at risk of committing grave human
rights abuses against their own citizens.]{.underline}

As we approach the 100th anniversary World War I, we should remember
that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably from what was
intended to be a minor conflict. [There is a danger that]{.underline} an
attack on Iran would escalate into a large-scale [[**war in the Middle
East**,]{.mark} entirely **[destabiliz]{.mark}ing [a
region]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is already [deep in
problems]{.underline}. The unstable government of [[Pakistan
might]{.mark} be overthrown]{.underline}, and the revolutionary
Pakistani government might enter the war on the side of Iran, thus
[[introduc]{.mark}ing **[nuclear weapons]{.mark} into the
conflict**]{.underline}. [**[Russia and China]{.mark}**, firm allies of
Iran, [might]{.mark} also [be drawn into a]{.mark} general [war]{.mark}
in the Middle East]{.underline}. Since much of the world\'s oil comes
from the region, such a war would certainly cause the price of oil to
reach unheard-of heights, with catastrophic effects on the global
economy. In the dangerous situation that could potentially result from
an attack on Iran, there is a risk that [[**nuclear weapons would be
used**,]{.mark} either [intentionally,]{.mark} or [by accident or
miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recent research has shown that
[besides [making]{.mark} large areas of [the world
uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline} through long-lasting radioactive
contamination, [a nuclear war would damage global agriculture to such a
extent that a]{.underline} [[global famine]{.mark} of previously unknown
proportions [would result]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [nuclear war is
[the ultimate ecological catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[It could
destroy human civilization and]{.mark} much of [the
biosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To risk such a war would be an
unforgivable offense against the lives and future of all the peoples of

#### More broadly, commitment to authoritarian regimes gives them too much bargaining power, which results in failed states

These [domestic struggles did not unfold in a geopolitical
vacuum]{.underline}. [After the sunset of colonialism, great powers
continued to intervene across the region as they sought resources like
oil and gas, coveted strategic assets like the Suez Canal, and amplified
proxy clashes like the Arab-Israeli wars]{.underline}. [Such hegemons
bolstered endangered local regimes deemed focal to their strategic
interests through diplomatic, fiscal, and military support.]{.underline}
The United States, for instance, rescued Pahlavi rule in Iran and
Hashemite dictatorship in Jordan during the 1950s. British troops
safeguarded monarchical friends in Iraq during World War II and Bahrain
in 1956. By the 1960s, Soviet advisers and arms were flooding Egypt and
Syria, backing these states against their pro-Western rivals in the
struggle for regional influence. At the same time, other Middle East
regimes confronted societal resistance alone, bereft of foreign
patronage. The Sabah dynasty of Kuwait and the fledgling Bourguibist
presidency of Tunisia garnered little assistance from imperial patrons
when they defeated entrenched opposition movements by the late 1950s.

[These two catalysts---domestic conflict and geopolitical mediation---
combined to form a striking pattern across the Middle East. The more
that outside hegemons intervened to help local rulers squash domestic
opposition, the less durable their regimes turned out over
time.]{.underline} [External support was destructive]{.underline} in the
long term, because [it deterred national leaders from making inclusive
bargains with opposing social forces and encouraged reliance upon
repressive and exclusionary institutions.]{.underline} In contrast,
[autocrats who lacked external patrons were forced to negotiate with
domestic rivals, favoring compromise over coercion. Facing the
potentiality of defeat, they had to sacrifice much to win more support
and through this costly process created more inclusive states that would
experience less conflict and instability during future
decades]{.underline}. In essence, political order in the postcolonial
Middle East was more likely to be durable when founding conflicts
between state and society were secluded from geopolitical interference.

It is also important to determine exactly the process in which one
state's vulnerabilities shape the behavior of more powerful states. We
have seen how [weak states and their **incapacity** to handle threats
have **determined the behavior of greater powers**]{.underline}. The
**[geopolitical vulnerabilities]{.underline}** of Belgium and the
Netherlands have served as the German gateway to France. **[Economic
contagion]{.underline}** has ruined states through bankruptcy; more
fortunate states have had to prepare for the eventuality of economic
collapse brought on by external forces. **[Refugee crises]{.underline}**
[brought on by serious environmental disasters present major challenges
for other states. **Ebola**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[other
outbreaks]{.underline}** **[threaten human civilization]{.underline}**,
[forcing states to act quickly to pursue **containment**]{.underline}.
**[Terrorist networks]{.underline}** [like **Islamic
State**]{.underline} have brought countries both far and near together
in efforts neutralize their force. **[Drug trafficking]{.underline}**
networks have also forced the hand of states: Plan Colombia is a major
example of the USA's support of another nation's battle with cartels.8
**[Cyber-security]{.underline}** is indeed a concern of every country,
yet we are seeing inaction on the part of states. This
[present]{.underline}s [a **serious conundrum**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of others will affect
the **security and power of states**]{.underline}. [Then there are
criminal networks]{.underline}: following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, for example, [the]{.underline} Russian **[mafia]{.underline}**,
[weapons **proliferation**]{.underline}, **[sale of
weapons]{.underline}** (**[nuclear]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}

**[American leaders]{.underline}** like to **[portray the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as an exemplar of
ethical conduct in the international system]{.underline}**. The
**[reality is far different]{.underline}**, and it has been for decades.
Throughout the Cold War, the United States embraced extremely repressive
rulers, including the Shah of Iran, Nicaragua's Somoza family, Taiwan's
Chiang Kai-shek, and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, all the while portraying
them as noble members of the "Free World." Such blatant **[hypocrisy and
double standards continue today regarding]{.underline}** both
Washington's own dubious behavior and **[the U.S. attitude toward the
behavior of]{.underline}** favored **[allies]{.underline}** and friends.

The gap between professed values and actual policy is especially evident
in the Middle East. **[U.S. officials routinely excoriate Syria and
Iran, not only for their external behavior, but for manifestations of
domestic abuse and repression.]{.underline}** Some of those criticisms
are valid. Both Bashar al-Assad's regime and Iran's clerical government
are guilty of serious international misconduct and human-rights
violations. But the **[credibility of Washington's]{.underline}**
expressions of **[outrage is vitiated when]{.underline}** those same
**[officials remain silent,]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}** even
**[excuse]{.underline}**, equally serious---and in some cases, more
egregious---**[abuses that]{.underline}** the United States and its
**[allies]{.underline}** **[commit]{.underline}**.

Following the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons in early
April, President Trump painted Assad as an exceptionally vile enemy. He
immediately issued a tweet describing the Syrian leader as "an animal"
who gassed his own people. In his subsequent address to the American
people announcing punitive air and missile strikes, Trump charged that
the incident confirmed "a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very
terrible regime. The evil and despicable attack left mothers and
fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air.
These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster
instead." The president also blasted Russia and Iran for their
longstanding sponsorship of Assad. "To Iran and to Russia, I ask: What
kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent
men, women and children?"

TAC's Daniel Larison provided an apt response to that question. "Trump
should know the answer, since he just hosted one of the chief architects
of the war on Yemen that the **[U.S. has backed to the hilt for the last
three year]{.underline}**s. Britain welcomed the Saudi crown prince
earlier on, and France just hosted him in the last few days. All three
have **[been arming and supporting the Saudis and their allies in Yemen
no matter how many atrocities they commit]{.underline}**."

#### This [wrecks U.S. credibility globally]{.underline} by signaling to arms buyers that they can [act with impunity]{.underline} \-\-- preference for American weapons gives the U.S. [leverage]{.underline} to encourage behavior changes

[When]{.underline} President [Trump argues]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[can't halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the]{.underline} Saudis'
alleged [murder of]{.underline} journalist and Post contributor Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.underline}, **[he's giving up a key piece of leverage over
Riyadh for no reason at all]{.underline}**. What's worse, **[Trump
is]{.underline}** also **[turning one of America's best strategic assets
into a liability, a massive unforced error that could weaken
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[worldwide]{.underline}**.

[Trump has said repeatedly he doesn't want to halt --- or even threaten
to halt --- U.S. arms sales]{.underline} to the Saudi regime
[because]{.underline} (he says) [it would]{.underline} cost U.S. jobs
and [hand over a sweet contract to Moscow or Beijing]{.underline}.

"They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted
that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it,"
Trump said on "60 Minutes" Sunday. "I don't want to hurt jobs. I don't
want to lose an order like that."

Set aside that Trump's claim of \$110 billion of arms sales to Saudi
Arabia as announced last year is hugely exaggerated, considering that
number mostly refers to deals struck during the Obama administration and
new deals that haven't yet materialized. **[The significant arms-sales
relationship we do have with Saudi Arabia gives us enormous leverage
over them]{.underline}**, leverage Trump should use to pressure King
Salman to reveal what his regime knows about Khashoggi's disappearance.

**[Saudi Arabia's military is already built around U.S. and British
defense platforms, meaning they can't easily switch to Russian or
Chinese systems.]{.underline}** [**Riyadh is especially dependent on
U.S. arms right now** because their bloody war in Yemen requires a
constant flow of U.S. munitions]{.underline}, not to mention U.S.
intelligence, maintenance and refueling support.

**[U.S. arms sales]{.underline}** are not simply a financial deal or a
jobs program; they **[represent a strategic advantage of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
**[Countries want U.S. weapons because they are the best. That gives us
connections, influence and, yes, leverage over these
countries.]{.underline}** [That's how arms sales have always worked,
until Trump flipped the script.]{.underline}

**["The White House seems to be saying that Trump Doctrine is that the
U.S. will ignore your human rights abuses]{.underline}**, assassinations

totally and completely backwards,"]{.underline} Sen. Chris
[Murphy]{.underline} (D-Conn.) [told me. **"What's the point of being a
military superpower if we lose leverage when we do business with another
country?"**]{.underline}

"What the president doesn't realize is that **[this makes him look weak
and small]{.underline}**. **[World leaders will now know they can act
with impunity so long as they are buying American weapons. That's an
insane message to send,"]{.underline}** Murphy said. ["The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should never be boxed
in because of who we sell weapons to --- **countries who buy U.S.
weapons should feel enormous pressure to stay on our good
side."**]{.underline}

Sen. Marco [Rubio]{.underline} (R-Fla.) [made a similar
point]{.underline} Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" with Jake
Tapper.

**["Arm sales are important, not because of the money, but because it
also provides leverage over their future behavior,"]{.underline}** he
said. "You know ... [they will need our spare parts. They will need our
training. And those are things **we can use to influence their
behavior**."]{.underline}

Congress does have a role to play in approving arms sales, and all
indications are that they plan to intervene on sales to Riyadh if it is
shown that the Saudi regime had a hand in Khashoggi's death. The State
Department approved a \$15 billion sale of the Terminal High Altitude
Air Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to Saudi Arabia this month.
The Pentagon said last week Saudi Arabia has signed letters of offer or
acceptance of \$14.5 billion worth of American helicopters, tanks,
ships, weapons and training.

In June, the Senate narrowly voted down a resolution to halt the sale of
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of precision-guided munitions to
the Saudi military out of concern they could be used to target Yemeni
civilians. After the vote, Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking
Democrat Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said he opposed the sale, placing it
in limbo.

[The threat of congressional action would be more effective if the
president]{.underline} of the United States [wasn't publicly undermining
Congress's message, said]{.underline} William [Hartung, director of the
Arms and Security Project at the Center for International
Policy]{.underline}.

**["Trump is not even trying to use this leverage,"]{.underline}** he
said. "He's completely given it away, and not only that, **[he's
announced to the world that he's giving it away."]{.underline}**

Through a basic misunderstanding of national security and diplomacy, the
president has once again undermined U.S. interests and made the work of
his own team --- including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo --- much more
difficult. **[Thinking of arms sales purely in dollar terms doesn't make
any sense.]{.underline}**

#### Failure to prioritize human rights over security interests in arms sales decisions saps our overall [diplomatic credibility]{.underline}

Ms. OMAR. Thank you, Chairman. I want to first thank our distinguished
witnesses for coming to testify. Thank you so much for taking the time.

The Saudi-led coalition has engaged in a military action in Yemen for a
little over 3 years now and the ongoing military campaign has triggered
one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. In the last three and a
half years more than 17,000 people have been killed and another 40,000
wounded. Further, three million have been internally displaced and
according to USAID, 22.2 million Yemenis or three quarters of the Yemeni
population need humanitarian assistance. Millions are on the verge of
starvation. There is a cholera outbreak that is tied to the Saudi-led
war that has erupted in 21 of Yemen's 22 provinces infecting more,
approximately a million Yemenis making it one of the worst cholera
outbreaks in our history.

And [I know that we are having a conversation about what our interests
are, but I want us to root this conversation in the interest of
protecting human life and furthering our values of protecting human
life]{.underline}. I agree with my colleague, Mr. Perry, that we have
known for years about Saudi brutality and its atrocities, its atrocity
record of human rights, women's rights, and religious freedom. Where I
strongly disagree is that we should not have even tolerated this type of
behavior from an ally.

As Chairman Engel noted earlier, there is also evidence that the
coalition is arming the al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula linked
fighters in Yemen, directly undercutting our military's objective there.
This is also far from the first time the Saudis have supported and
enabled jihadis. My concern is about [the way our support for the
Saudis, in spite of these clear contradictions with our values and our
interests are affecting our **diplomatic credibility in the region**.
When we see other members of that region like Iran commit human rights
atrocities or engaging in activities that are destabilizing the region,
we are quick to condemn them and call them out.]{.underline}

So my question is to Mr. Sullivan. In your answer to Mr. Levin's
question earlier, [you said human rights needs to be at a higher
priority. Can you explain why]{.underline} that is?

Mr. SULLIVAN. **[In a number of our significant relationships around the
world including the]{.underline}** U.S.-**[Saudi relationship we
sometimes have to make decisions about what we are placing paramount
priority on in terms of what we deal with on a day-to-day
basis.]{.underline}** And [there are instances throughout Democratic and
Republican administrations where **human rights take a back seat to
short-term security interest concerns**]{.underline}. That has happened
in the Obama Administration, the Bush Administration, the Clinton
Administration. **[It is happening with much more frequency in the Trump
administration.]{.underline}**

[The issue I see with Saudi Arabia is that **we have allowed that to
become so embedded in our muscle memory in the relationship that we
basically do not really press on human rights concerns much at
all**]{.underline}. And **[particularly with the current President
essentially saying, I do not care about those issues]{.underline}**, do
as you please, I think **[this has reached a point where it is no longer
sustainable for the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and that **[we have to find a
way]{.underline}** consistent with the complexity of our interests in
the region **[to elevate the dialog and discourse and urgency of our
demands of our partners that they do better when it comes to how they
treat their citizens]{.underline}**.

Ms. OMAR. And do you think this double standard is impacting our
diplomatic credibility in the region?

Mr. SULLIVAN. I think it is a broader issue with U.S. foreign policy.
**[Any time you are both engaged in power politics in the world and you
are trying to advance values as the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[does, you are going
to have certain instances of inconsistency and hypocrisy]{.underline}**.
That is built in to a unique attribute of American policy, which is [we
do care about these issues the way a lot of other countries do not and
so necessarily sometimes there will be inconsistency]{.underline}.

**[I do not think that has to undermine our credibility, but it does
mean we have to be more forthright and honest about it and do a better
job of making sure that we are not simply ignoring human rights
issues]{.underline}**, I think, **[as we all too often have done in this
relationship]{.underline}**, again in a bipartisan way. I am not trying
to use this as a political cudgel just against this administration.

#### Revitalizing human rights leadership is critical to address terrorism, ISIS, cyber attacks, econ collapse, disease, and refugee crises 

**Schnetzer, 16** \-\-- Fellow, Global Initiatives at the George W. Bush
Institute (7/21/16, Amanda, "Why promoting freedom and human rights is
in our national interest,"
<https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2016/07/why-promoting-freedom-is-in-national-interest.html>,
accessed on 6/4/19)

Substantially more people experience liberty today than at the end of
World War II, but [more than half the world's population still lives in
countries where basic political rights and civil liberties are only
partly respected, if at all]{.underline}. The last decade in particular
has not been good for freedom.

[For ten consecutive years, Freedom House has documented a **worrisome
"decline in global freedom."**]{.underline} The National Endowment for
Democracy has warned of [authoritarian regimes cracking down at home
while also "seeking to reshape the international order and democratic
norms."]{.underline}

**[From China to Russia to the Middle East, the challengers to
liberalism are gaining ground.]{.underline}** It [is in the direct and
immediate interest of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to help shift the balance by supporting the
advance of human rights and freedom abroad]{.underline}**.

The current mood in the United States does not appear conducive to this
strategy. New Pew Research polling shows that 69 percent of Americans
believe the United States should "concentrate more on our own national
problems." Seventy percent want the next U.S. president to focus on
domestic policy over foreign policy.

Yet **[in order to address the "major threats"]{.underline}** that keep
Americans awake at night --- [**ISIS, foreign cyberattacks, global
economic instability, the spread of infectious diseases, the refugee
crisis --- strong U.S. leadership is required**, as are strategies that
help advance rule of law, good governance, open markets, and other
features of free societies.]{.underline}

So where do we go from here?

[One step would be for policymakers]{.underline}, presidential
candidates, and other public office hopefuls [to make the promotion of
democracy and human rights an important part of their foreign policy
agendas]{.underline}. This March, 139 policy experts, civil society
leaders, and former elected officials---Republicans and Democrats
alike---signed a letter encouraging the presidential candidates to do
just that.

[While recognizing that "democracy and human rights cannot be the only
items on the foreign policy agenda,"]{.underline} the letter calls it [a
"false choice" to pit the pursuit of democratic ideals against national
security]{.underline}. I was proud to sign that letter.

A second step would be to engage the American people in a conversation
about the impact of advancing freedom on our own peace, prosperity, and
security.

[At the end of World War II]{.underline}, for example, [many questioned
whether democracy was compatible with Germany and Japan.
The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[actively supported the development of democratic institutions and
practices. Today, Germany and Japan are among our strongest partners and
allies in the world]{.underline}, and Americans reap tangible benefits.

In North Texas, where the Bush Institute is located, the relocation of
Toyota's North American headquarters is expected to create jobs and have
an economic impact of \$7 billion in the first ten years, according to
estimates when the move was announced.

[During the Cold War, the United States supported democratic reform in
places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Chile. The end of
the Cold War was a major victory for freedom in Central and Eastern
Europe. After decades of Soviet nuclear threat, it also was a great
victory for American peace and security.]{.underline}

[Today, **the moral and strategic imperatives of advancing human rights
are just as compelling**. In Afghanistan, investing in women promotes
stability and helps reduce the possibility of future terrorist attacks
on the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[emanating from that country. In the Middle East]{.underline}, the
spread of Islamic extremism and [ISIS has had devastating consequences,
and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[is not immune]{.underline}. [In North Korea, a regime that
systematically and horrifically abuses the rights of its own people
seeks nuclear weapons that can reach our shores.]{.underline}

In these and other places, it is in the interests of the United States
to see the forces of freedom eventually prevail.

A third step would be to find opportunities for immediate bipartisan
action. Both Republican and Democrat presidents have affirmed the U.S.
commitment to standing for freedom at home and leading the advance of
freedom abroad. Congress, too, has played an important role.

Ensuring continued support for democracy and development assistance
overseas, promoting progress on human rights in trade and economic
agreements, and continuing support for initiatives like the President\'s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that relieve human suffering are
just some of the options available to policymakers today.

In the current political environment, this may be a tall order, but [the
stakes at home and abroad are high and American leadership is
essential]{.underline}.

#### Only renewed U.S. leadership will save global democracy \-\-- autocracies must be checked

**Diamond, 5/17/19** \-\-- senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and
at Stanford University\'s Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies (Larry, Wall Street Journal (Online), "The Global Crisis of
Democracy; As China and Russia attack free governments and push
strongman rule, the U.S. has gone silent---and a new tide of
authoritarianism is gathering," Proquest database, JMP)

**[There is nothing inevitable about the expansion of
democracy.]{.underline}** Among countries with populations above one
million, there were only 11 democracies in 1900, 20 in 1920 and 29 in
1974. Only for the past quarter of a century has democracy been the
world\'s predominant form of government. By 1993, the number of
democracies had exploded to 77---representing, for the first time in
history, a majority of countries with at least one million people. By
2006, the number of democracies had ticked up to 86.

But **[we are now at a precarious moment. Democracy faces a global
crisis.]{.underline}** [We have seen 12 consecutive years of erosion in
global levels of political rights and civil liberties, with many more
countries declining than gaining each year]{.underline}, according to
the nonprofit group Freedom House. [Over the past decade, one in six
democracies has failed. Today only a bare majority of the world\'s
larger states remain democracies.]{.underline}

Nor do the numbers capture the full extent of the danger. Behind the
statistics is a steady, palpable corrosion of democratic institutions
and norms in a range of countries. [**China, Russia and their admirers
are making headway with a new global narrative**, hailing strongman
rule---not government by the people---as the way forward in difficult
times.]{.underline}

[**Until recently, U.S. resolve had helped to hold back today\'s main
foes of democracy**: an ambitious and rising China, a resentful and
declining Russia, and a new wave of populist authoritarians from Hungary
to the Philippines.]{.underline} Now, however, America\'s own political
decay is increasingly advanced. President Donald Trump has insulted U.S.
allies, befriended Vladimir Putin, excused a grim list of other
dictators, embraced nativist politics and movements, and shaken the
post-World War II liberal order. But the problem also includes cynical
politicians in both parties, calcified systems that don\'t deliver
public goods and complacent citizens who cannot bestir themselves to
vote.

All of this is tarnishing the overall luster of democracy---and pulling
America away from the world. **[If we do not soon reverse this U.S.
retreat, democracy world-wide will be at risk.]{.underline}**

As the late Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington explained,
democratic change doesn\'t happen in isolation. Rather, it surges
forward and retreats in waves , across regions and the whole globe. In a
democratic wave, the number of countries making the transition to
democracy greatly exceeds the number moving away from it, and overall
levels of liberty rise. In a reverse wave, the opposite is true:
Democracy shrinks, and so does human freedom.

Huntington argued that the first wave of global democratization began
with the democratization of the U.S., which he dates (disputably) to
1828, when more than half of all white American males became eligible to
vote. Gradually, the first wave engulfed most of Western Europe as well
as a few countries in Eastern Europe (such as Poland), Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and four South American countries. A century
later, more than 30 countries (some quite small) had \"established at
least minimal national democratic institutions,\" Huntington wrote.

As this first wave was cresting, a reverse wave began gathering in 1922,
when the Italian fascist Benito Mussolini marched on Rome and quickly
disposed of Italy\'s fragile democracy. Democratic reversals soon
followed in Portugal, Poland and the Baltics. The crucial turning point
came in 1933, when the Nazis took power in Germany. As liberal societies
struggled with the prolonged economic depression of the 1930s, doubts
about democracy\'s viability grew, even in Britain and the U.S.

It took the defeat of the Axis powers in World War II to halt this
momentum and launch the second wave of democratization. That second wave
restored democracy to most of Western Europe, introduced the first real
democracies in Japan and Turkey, and spread democracy further into Latin
America. But this wave was short-lived, ending in 1962. With the
exception of Costa Rica, Venezuela and Colombia, most of the new and
restored Latin American democracies fell in a spree of military coups.

The second wave also saw the birth of many new democracies through
decolonization, as the European empires in Africa, Asia and the Middle
East collapsed after World War II. These burgeoning democracies were
mainly former British colonies that had some experience with elections
and the rule of law, including India, Sri Lanka, Jamaica, Botswana,
Ghana, Nigeria and Burma. The first four of these democracies have
survived (except a brief period of emergency rule in India in 1975-77
and a more recent interruption in Sri Lanka), but most multiparty
systems in the Third World---including Turkey, South Korea, Indonesia
and many African countries---ultimately gave way to military, one-party
or one-man rule.

The third wave of democratization began in 1974, when a cabal of young,
left-wing military officers in Portugal overthrew its dictatorship, one
of the longest-surviving in Europe. Later that year, Greece---the
birthplace of democracy---restored it after a seven-year-old military
dictatorship collapsed following a defeat by Turkey in Cyprus. In 1978,
Spain became Europe\'s third new democracy, under a young conservative
prime minister determined to overcome the Franco dictatorship.
Aspirations for freedom were also stirring in Asia and Latin America.

In 1977, a new U.S. president of deeply Christian faith, Jimmy Carter,
began to change U.S. foreign policy. He elevated human rights through
strong public denunciations of atrocities, foreign-aid cuts for some
abusive regimes and the creation of a new human-rights bureau at the
State Department.

Not everyone approved of this new idealism; in 1980, William F. Buckley
Jr. sighed that Mr. Carter was mixing \"business with displeasure.\" But
U.S. pressure spared the lives of political prisoners, gave hope to
democratic movements world-wide and undermined the legitimacy of
military autocrats. In 1978, for instance, Mr. Carter sent stern
warnings and U.S. warships to the Dominican Republic after its military
stopped a vote count to thwart an opposition victory; the country\'s
strongman, Joaquin Balaguer, was defeated, and a new (albeit tentative)
democracy emerged.

When Ronald Reagan defeated Mr. Carter in 1980, few expected a new
world-wide eruption of freedom. The new president and his U.N.
ambassador, Jeane Kirkpatrick, had condemned Mr. Carter for naively
ignoring communist tyrannies while pressuring authoritarian U.S. allies
like the shah of Iran to liberalize. Reagan vowed in his 1981 inaugural
address to \"match loyalty with loyalty,\" which seemed to portend
renewed support for such autocratic friends of the U.S. as Augusto
Pinochet\'s Chile, Ferdinand Marcos\'s Philippines, a coup-prone South
Korea and apartheid South Africa. But by the time Reagan left office in
1989, all four regimes were gone or fading---followed in short order by
the Soviet Union itself.

In June 1982, Reagan delivered a historic speech at the British
Parliament in which he became among the first to recognize that a
\"democratic revolution\" was sweeping the world---and that it deserved
U.S. support. The next year, with unusually bipartisan support, Congress
established the National Endowment for Democracy (where I have long
served as an adviser).

Reagan\'s personal commitment was soon apparent. Take the Philippines:
In 1986, amid an election there, the new endowment gave financial
support to vote monitors, and the Reagan administration sent a
delegation (led by the late Republican Sen. Richard Lugar) to monitor
the balloting. As evidence mounted that Marcos had brazenly tried to
steal the election, Reagan threatened to cut off military aid if the
strongman used force and agreed to recognize the opposition candidate,
Corazon Aquino, as president. A U.S. Air Force plane flew the Marcoses
to exile in Hawaii, with 12 bags full of gold, jewelry, clothing and
cash valued at \$15 million.

A third democratic wave was breaking across Asia. Under pressure from
the U.S. Congress, Taiwan lifted martial law. In 1987, South Korea
inaugurated its own democracy with a free election. Not every freedom
movement succeeded. In 1989, China\'s Communist Party launched a deadly
military assault on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square,
killing what a recently declassified British cable estimated at more
than 10,000 people. With them died the hope for democratic change in
China for more than a generation.

Share Your Thoughts

Is democracy in danger today? Join the conversation below.

Still, by 1989, the proportion of democracies in the world had risen to
40% of all countries. Autocratic holdouts in Latin America were giving
way, including Chile, where pressure from the Reagan administration
helped to tip the balance against Pinochet\'s junta. Nicaragua\'s
far-left Sandinista dictator, Daniel Ortega, was defeated at the polls
after U.S. economic and diplomatic pressure got him to agree to
international election monitoring.

The most historic changes occurred in Europe. Decades of bipartisan U.S.
containment of the Soviet Union, from Harry Truman to George H.W. Bush,
had helped to produce an internal reform movement that came to be led by
Mikhail Gorbachev. Unlike his predecessors, who crushed Hungary\'s 1956
uprising and Czechoslovakia\'s 1968 \"Prague Spring,\" Mr. Gorbachev let
democratization sweep across the region, with Soviet puppet states
falling from East Germany to Romania. In 1991, the Soviet Union itself
collapsed.

That produced global shock waves. In Africa, opposition parties were
legalized, personal freedoms were widened, and multiparty elections were
held. In 1994, the white-supremacist minority regime in South Africa
gave way to a robust democracy led by a freely elected President Nelson
Mandela. In the early years of the 21st century, three so-called color
revolutions brought freedom to Serbia, Georgia and Ukraine. For the
first time in history, most of the countries on Earth were democracies.
Every region on the planet, except the Middle East, had a critical mass
of democracies.

It was inevitable that democracy\'s rapid march during the 1980s and
\'90s would slow. By 2000, most of the countries with the socioeconomic
conditions favorable for democracy had already adopted it. But the
world\'s sole superpower, the U.S., was joined with Europe in promoting
democracy as the only legitimate form of government. There seemed no
reason to believe that a third reverse wave was likely. Even in the five
years after the shock of 9/11, the world added seven more democracies.

But after 2006, three decades of progress ground to a halt---and began
to reverse. The key elements of this alarming deterioration have been
the rise of illiberal, anti-immigrant populist movements in Europe and
the U.S.; the steady decline in the quality of American democracy; and
the surge in global power of Russia and China, which are avidly
undermining democratic and liberal values around the world.

In earlier reverse waves, military coups were the main method of the
democratic recession. Not today. [The death of democracy is now
typically administered in a thousand cuts.]{.underline} In one country
after another, elected leaders have gradually attacked the deep tissues
of democracy---the independence of the courts, the business community,
the media, civil society, universities and sensitive state institutions
like the civil service, the intelligence agencies and the police.
Whether the agent of destruction is a right-wing nationalist like
Vladimir Putin in Russia or a left-wing \"Bolivarian\" socialist like
Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, the effect is the same: The structures and
norms of democracy are eviscerated, one by one, until all that is left
is a hollow shell.

[The global trend is sour.]{.underline} Religious intolerance is on the
rise in the huge democracies of Indonesia and India. [Surveys show that
most Africans still passionately want democratic and accountable
government, but the combination of Chineses boldness, European
distraction and American retreat are increasingly enabling African
autocrats to have their way.]{.underline} In the Middle East,
Tunisia---the lone Arab democracy still standing after the 2011 Arab
Spring---is facing a reeling economy, powerful Gulf autocrats who want
democracy to wither and opportunistic survivors from the old
dictatorship.

[The problem is not just that democracies are declining; it is that
**autocracies are becoming steadily more repressive and
aggressive**.]{.underline} [When the Cold War ended, authoritarians like
Hun Sen in Cambodia and Yoweri Museveni in Uganda **felt
compelled**]{.underline}---even as they rigged elections and arrested
critics---[**to tolerate opposition parties**, presidential challengers,
a nettlesome press and a vigilant civil society]{.underline}. But as the
global climate has changed, those restraints have evaporated. [Inspired
by the new swagger of]{.underline} Xi Jinping\'s [China and]{.underline}
Vladimir Putin\'s [Russia]{.underline}, [and **emboldened by the silence
from**]{.underline} Mr. **[Trump\'s America, today\'s autocrats
tyrannize their opponents openly and without apology]{.underline}**.

**[Slow descents have a way of lulling us into
complacency.]{.underline}** Things aren\'t so bad, we tell ourselves;
they\'re just slipping a bit. [In]{.underline} Ernest [Hemingway\'s
\"The Sun Also Rises,\"]{.underline} the freewheeling, hard-drinking
Mike [Campbell is asked how he went bankrupt. \"Two ways,\"]{.underline}
he says. **[\"Gradually and then suddenly.\" The demise of democracy is
often like that too.]{.underline}**

[We can still reverse these ill winds.]{.underline} We can even help
generate a new burst of freedom in the world. **[But it will not happen
without vigorous American leadership]{.underline}**---[to support
democrats, pressure autocrats and counter the malign expansion of
Russian and Chinese power]{.underline}.

[As one of the countless millions of people who were freed or protected
from totalitarianism by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates of
America, [it is easy for me to talk about the past]{.underline}. To talk
about the belief of the American people and their leaders that this
country was exceptional, and had special responsibilities to match its
tremendous power. That a nation founded on freedom was bound to defend
freedom everywhere. I could talk about the bipartisan legacy of this
most American principle, from the Founding Fathers, to Democrats like
Harry Truman, to Republicans like Ronald Reagan. [I could talk about how
the American people used to care deeply about human rights and
dissidents in far-off places, and how this is what made America a beacon
of hope, a shining city on a hill. America led by example and set a high
standard, a standard that exposed the hypocrisy and cruelty of
dictatorships around the world]{.underline}.

But there is no time for nostalgia. [Since the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War,
Americans]{.underline}, and America, [have retreated from those
principles]{.underline}, [and the world has become much worse off as a
result]{.underline}. American skepticism about America's role in the
world deepened in the long, painful wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and
their aftermaths. Instead of applying the lessons learned about how to
do better, lessons about faulty intelligence and working with native
populations, the main outcome was to stop trying.

[This result has been a tragedy for the billions of people still living
under authoritarian regimes around the world, and it is based on faulty
analysis. You can never guarantee a positive outcome]{.underline}--- not
in chess, not in war, and certainly not in politics. [The best you can
do is to do what you know is right and to try your best]{.underline}. I
speak from experience when I say that [the citizens of unfree states do
not expect guarantees. They want a reason to hope and a fighting chance.
People living under dictatorships want the opportunity for freedom, the
opportunity to live in peace and to follow their dreams. From the Iraq
War to the Arab Spring to the current battles for liberty from Venezuela
to Eastern Ukraine, people are fighting for that opportunity, giving up
their lives for freedom. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[must not abandon them]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the rest of the free
world has an unprecedented advantage in economic and military
strength]{.underline} today. [What is lacking is the will]{.underline}.
The will [to make the case to the American people, the will to take
risks and invest in the long-term security of the country, and the
world. This will require investments in aid, in education, in security
that allow countries to attain the stability their people so badly need.
Such investment is far more moral and far cheaper than the cycle of
**terror**, **war**, **refugees**, and **military intervention** that
results when America leaves a vacuum of power. The best way to help
refugees is to prevent them from becoming refugees in the first
place]{.underline}.

[The Soviet Union was an existential threat]{.underline}, and this
focused the attention of the world, and the American people.
[The]{.underline}re [**existential threat** today is not found on a map,
but **it is very real**. The forces of the past are making steady
progress against the modern world order. **Terrorist movements in the
Middle East**, **extremist parties across Europe**, a **paranoid tyrant
in North Korea threatening nuclear blackmail**, and]{.underline}, at the
center of the web, [**an aggressive KGB dictator in Russia**. They all
want to turn the world back to a dark past because their survival is

U.S. has retreated. The global freedom index has declined for ten
consecutive years. No one like to talk about the U]{.underline}nited

[The Cold War was won on American values that were shared by both

democracies. Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for
long-range planning. In contrast, dictators can operate only tactically,
not strategically, because they are not constrained by the balance of
powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival. This is
why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability to move
quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals that are
based on shared values, not on polls and cable news]{.underline}.

## Autocracy Extensions 

### XT: Autocracy

#### Uniquely, Saudi arms sales constitute a bromance between Trump and autocrats at the root of the decay of democracy. Signalling/spillover of MBS as a partner.

Sarah **Aziza 4-10**-2019 {Journalist covering issues related to the
Middle East, feminism, and human rights, \"Trump's Veto on Yemen War Is
a Sign That the Strongmen in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia Are Winning,\"
*Intercept*,
<https://theintercept.com/2019/04/18/trump-veto-yemen-saudi-arabia-mbs/>,
Accessed 6/19/19} //RG

The bill, though, just like [the president's objection]{.underline} to
it, [had much]{.underline} [more to do with Trump's relentless and
ill-advised devotion to MBS. The resolution first gained momentum in the
aftermath of Khashoggi's murder]{.underline} in October 2018, a crime
that many --- including the U.S. intelligence community --- have linked
to the crown prince. [MBS is also responsible for]{.underline} leading
[the]{.underline} coalition of Persian Gulf states in its four-year
[offensive in Yemen, which has left thousands of Yemeni civilians dead
and millions ravaged by famine and disease]{.underline}. In addition to
overseeing this disastrous war, MBS has [also]{.underline} ordered
[numerous crackdowns on his own civilians, including mass arrests and
alleged torture of nonviolent human rights advocates]{.underline}.

By calling for an end to U.S. support for the war, [Congress took aim at
Trump's obstinate and increasingly untenable loyalty to
MBS]{.underline}. Since Khashoggi's killing, [even staunch
supporters]{.underline} of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, such as Sen.
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., [have grown critical]{.underline} of Riyadh. In
contrast, [Trump has persistently ignored the ongoing abuse of Saudi
human rights activists and downplayed the mounting catastrophe in Yemen,
calling Saudi Arabia a "truly spectacular ally."]{.underline}

[IT WAS NO great surprise, then, to see the president resort to veto
power to protect MBS's disastrous Yemen campaign]{.underline}. Beneath
the shallow appeals to constitutionalism and national security, [Trump
is acting in accordance with a now-familiar pattern: gravitating toward
fellow strongmen and personality-driven deal-making. This
**entrepreneurial narcissism** has fueled much of the president's
volatile foreign policy, from his on-again-off-again "relationships"
with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim
Jong-un to his rabid devotion to building a wall on the Mexican
border.]{.underline}

This trend has dramatic implications in the Middle East. [Since the
collapse of the Arab Spring and in the wake of years of foreign
intervention, hopes of democracy in the region have]{.underline} in
large part [given way to a cast of authoritarian rulers]{.underline}.
From [MBS]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia to Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan]{.underline} in Turkey to the recently re-elected Benjamin
[Netanyahu]{.underline} in Israel, the region has grown increasingly
polarized under hawkish, right-wing leaders.

Among this fray, [Trump]{.underline}, along with his his son-in-law and
adviser Jared Kushner, [identified MBS as an ideal partner. The
president and crown prince share an alarmist message of Iran as a
regional menace and both use this stance to justify destabilizing
policies, such as the dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal and the war
in Yemen. Trump has also lauded MBS and the Saudis for their alleged
work to curb extremism in the region]{.underline}, despite reports that
Riyadh has cut deals with Al Qaeda fighters in Yemen.

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia promotes American complicity in the autocracy's actions---this lessens the push for reform.

News of the **[disappearance of]{.underline}** Washington Post
**[journalist Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline}** at the Saudi Arabian
consulate **[in Istanbul]{.underline}** last week has
**[prompted]{.underline}** numerous **[lawmakers]{.underline}** on both
sides of the aisle **[to urge]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}**
administration **[to halt U.S.-Saudi arm sales]{.underline}** and
reevaluate a decades-long alliance **[that]{.underline}** has
**[enable]{.underline}**d **[the]{.underline}** Gulf **[nation's bad
behavior]{.underline}**.  President Donald Trump, however, shot down the
possibility Thursday, telling reporters he is unwilling to give up the
billions of dollars in funding from the U.S.-Saudi arms deal reached in
May 2017.  "I don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being
poured into our country," Trump said. "They are spending \$110 billion
on military equipment and on things that create jobs for this country."
 While the \$110 billion number Trump touted is "fake news" ([last
year's deal likely amounted to \$4 billion]{.underline}), the arms
agreement is the latest in nearly one century of U.S. military aid to
Saudi Arabia. Although U.S.-Saudi relations grew slightly tense toward
the end of President Obama's term, largely due to the U.S.-Iran nuclear
deal and Saudi's unwillingness to engage with Iran, Obama's
administration oversaw the largest U.S.-Saudi arms deals in American
history.  A 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service found
that, from 2008 to 2015, Obama's sales to Saudi Arabia amounted to
nearly \$94 billion. Those sales showed no signs of slowing down in 2015
as Saudi Arabia led a coalition of Arab countries in a military campaign
against the Houthi rebels in Yemen**[. The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has supported Saudi's efforts with "weapons
sales]{.underline}**, aerial refueling, intelligence, and targeting
support," BuzzFeed News reported.  People search for survivors under the
rubble of houses destroyed by Saudi airstrikes in the old city of Sanaa,
Yemen, Friday, June 12, 2015. U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia have
warmed considerably under President Trump, whose family remains
especially close with the Gulf kingdom's totalitarian prince Mohammed
bin Salman. Although Saudi Arabia has not purchased new arms platforms
under Trump, according to Lawfare's Bruce Reidel, the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[has helped soften Saudi's
image, refusing to hold them accountable for war crimes in Yemen or for
human rights violations within the country,]{.underline}** and
positioning the Gulf nation as a counter to Iran's influence in the
region.  Shortly after Trump visited Saudi Arabia in the spring, the
Senate tabled a bipartisan resolution to stop U.S. military funding that
supports Saudi Arabia's brutal actions in Yemen. As ThinkProgress
reporter D. Parvaz wrote at the time, U.S. military officials have aided
Saudi efforts in Yemen "by refueling Saudi coalition bombers, an
unauthorized action that can be stopped using the War Powers Resolution.
The bill that failed ... invoked the resolution and called for the
immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces in the country not fighting al
Qaeda."  As of August 2018, strikes by the **[Saudi-led coalition in

conference on Thursday, Trump downplayed the alleged murder at the hands
of a Saudi "assassination squad," telling reporters, "Again, this took
place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge Khashoggi is not a
U.S. citizen, is that right? He's a permanent resident."  Meanwhile,
numerous companies and investors have pulled out of the Saudi Future
Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh next week, with the
Financial Times and CNN being the latest to do so. In an interview with
CNBC Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he was still planning
to attend the conference. "We are concerned about what is the status of
Mr. Khashoggi," he said. "\[But\] I am planning on going at this point."

Given its overall investment in the military, **[Saudi]{.underline}**
Arabia's **[attempts to build an indigenous arms industry have yielded
limited results]{.underline}**. A government plan to reorganize and
diversify the economy, launched in 2017 and known as Vision 2030,
contains vague ambitions for the development of an arms industry. The
aim is to 'localize over 50 per cent of \[Saudi\] military equipment
spending by 2030', up from 2 per cent in 2017. A new company has been
created, Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), by consolidating
several existing companies. SAMI aims to 'assume a leading role in the
global military industry sector by 2030'. Given the challenges that
Saudi Arabia faces in developing its industrial base more generally, and
the difficulties other countries have faced when pursuing military
industrialization, the extent to which these goals can be achieved
within a 14-year period is highly questionable. Nevertheless**[, Saudi

All in all, [US arms trade provides the destructive hardware used in
human rights abuses, atrocities and conflicts across the Middle
East]{.underline}. [It undermines democracy and development,
contributing to the poverty and suffering of million]{.underline}s. A
new report by War on Want, Banking on Bloodshed, has just exposed, for
the first time, the extent to which the main American and European banks
are also funding this violent trade. They are using money to fund
companies that sell arms used against civilians in wars and
pro-democracy protests across the region, including the conflicts in
Iraq, Syria and Yemen. [They are financing an industry that sells arms
to regimes committing human rights abuses such as Israel, Saudi Arabia
and Bahrain]{.underline}. Money from Western banks is also being used to
fund companies that produce pernicious weapons like depleted uranium and
cluster bombs. Guess what? No one in the West even bothers to impose
sanctions on these banks!

#### Trump National Emergency in selling arms to Saudi Arabia undermines US democracy Harb, Writer on US foreign policy, 19

(Ali, "Trump bypassed Congress on Saudi weapons sale. Here\'s how he did
it" , Middle East Eye, May 30 2019,

[Schoolchildren in the United States are taught from a young age that a
separation of powers is the backbone of their country\'s
democracy.]{.underline}

[The system also comes with checks and balances]{.underline} meant to
limit the power that the executive, judicial and legislative branches of
government can wield, [to prevent overreach.]{.underline}

Last week, however, [President Donald Trump threw that civics lesson out
the window, declaring an emergency]{.underline} to bypass US lawmakers
and green-light an \$8bn weapons deal with Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited recent tensions with Iran to
justify pushing the sales through without congressional oversight.

[Critics have rejected that justification, noting mounting scepticism
towards the Trump administration\'s claims of an imminent Iranian threat
in the Middle East]{.underline}.

\"[It seemed more like a manufactured justification that so far is not
sitting well with many members of Congress,\"]{.underline} said
Christina Arabia, director at the Washington-based Security Assistance
Monitor, which tracks US arms sales and military assistance to foreign
countries.

Indeed, senior lawmakers have vowed to push back against the decision.

But the US president holds broad authority, and while the law grants
Congress oversight over weapon sales, the administration ultimately has
the upper hand.

### XT: Instability

#### Ending arm sales to Saudi Arabia is the [only]{.underline} route to sustainable peace and stability in the Middle East; it also spills over to influence other sellers. No fill-in and compliance is stronger without sales.

Sophia **Lam 19** {Staff Writer at UChicago Gate, "Ending US Arms Sales
to Saudi Arabia," *The Gate*,
<http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/>,
Published 4/9/19, Accessed 6/22/19} //RG

Many [supporters of arms sales]{.underline}, including the current US
government, [are concerned about protecting US influence and stabilizing
the Saudi-Iranian relationship]{.underline}. They argue that cutting
arms sales would reduce the US' presence, embolden Iran and allow the
Yemen conflict to further spiral out of control. Iran is backing Houthi
rebels that are fighting against Saudi Arabia. If the US scales back its
commitments to Saudi Arabia, Iran could expand its regional influence
and its purportedly violent tendencies. [However]{.underline}, as
mentioned earlier, it is important to note that [US arms sales are
themselves perpetuating the conflict by injecting weapons of war into
Yemen. Saudi Arabia is the medium through which myriad parties acquire
arms. Ending the arms sales will mitigate Saudi Arabia and Iran's
thirsts for power by constraining the conflict's capacity for
violence.]{.underline}

While the US government suggests that arms sales incline Saudi Arabia to
cooperate with the US' agenda, the reverse is true. [Rather than the
United States gaining leverage through arms sales, Saudi Arabia has
gained more power instead]{.underline}. Patricia Sullivan of Foreign
Policy Analysis writes that, [empirically, states that receive military
aid are less cooperative than states that do not]{.underline}. States
that receive military aid are willing to take advantage of their
leverage because [the US often refrains from holding allied states
completely accountable to their commitments or to American
principles.]{.underline} Khashoggi's murder casts a long shadow in that
regard: [Trump has chosen to turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's blatant
disregard for civil liberties]{.underline} in the professed service of
protecting America's economy. Though not anywhere near as powerful as
the US, Saudi Arabia has escaped the Khashoggi situation with its US
arms deals intact.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [continues to play a
preeminent role in Saudi weapons acquisitions. Europe]{.underline}an
countries [have reduced]{.underline} their arms [sales]{.underline} in
response to Khashoggi's death [while the United States has increased
sales]{.underline}. There are multiple actors in the international game
but [the US has the biggest muscles to flex]{.underline}, economically
and diplomatically speaking. [Nearly all of Saudi Arabia's weapons have
American parts or are maintained by American technicians. Saudi Arabia
cannot find an easy replacement for its US weapons imports: it would
take decades for Saudi Arabia to implement different systems and the
transition costs of such a switch would be monumental.]{.underline}

[By ending]{.underline} arms [sales, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can assert its sway over Saudi]{.underline}
Arabia: if Saudi weapons and systems are so reliant on US assistance,
perhaps [the Saudis should be compelled to comply with new US
terms]{.underline}; Such a move would help change the narrative that the
US will never use its military aid leverage over other countries. [If
the United States suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, **other major
arms exporters might either take similar measures or continue to follow
their own preexisting scalebacks**.]{.underline}

The United States' [arms sales to Saudi Arabia are flawed in
humanitarian, economic and political terms]{.underline}. Rather than
search for innovative ways to justify protecting arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can and should
work **to** legitimately **foster sustainable peace and stability in the
Middle East**]{.underline}. In short, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[ought to reverse its wrongs by ending its
arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. Doing so will not only allow
war-torn Yemen to begin to recover, but would also allow the United
States to better revitalize its own economy, and reassert its military
leverage and international authority to hold allied states like Saudi
Arabia accountable for their agendas and actions.

#### Saudi dominance financed by US munitions has destabilized the Gulf.

Political Risk Analyst, "Maturing Sino-Saudi strategic relations and

It is important when analysing China's growing 'footprint' into the Gulf
region, to consider the changing dynamics that have occurred within the
last decade. The GCC has presented itself as a force for economic and
security stability in [the Gulf]{.underline}. However, it [has never
been the political and economically stable region that it tries to
present to the global community]{.underline}, instead, [it has been
increasingly frayed by Saudi-dominance and political
disputes.]{.underline} While each state within the Gulf has secured
political power within a domestic context, in terms of the wider
geopolitical arena, [the region is consistently divided by regional and
ideological rivalry]{.underline}. This is best exemplified in the
relationship between [Saudi Arabian regional dominance and perceived
Iranian expansionism.]{.underline} Consequently, in the post-Arab Spring
period, [a new-found pragmatism in pursuing more independent regional
and foreign policies by Saudi Arabia and Qatar]{.underline} (like the
funding of Sunni jihadist groups in the Syrian conflict) [has caused
further instability to the region and even the fracturing of once sound
multilateral groups as the GCC]{.underline}.30 This comes as well
[within the context of a more prominent rivalry between Iran and Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} which will be explored further in the next section.

Economically, the region has had to deal with changes in the once stable
oil market. Fluctuations in the market have seen prices since mid-2014
dip to their lowest levels ever and have failed to gain ground to their
previous price. This has meant that the once concrete pillar of rentier
economics31 and the provision of economic benefits for regime legitimacy
has been questioned. Incidentally, [this has led to new thinking within
the Gulf Monarchies as to how to maintain the delicate balance between
economic growth, domestic consumption and regime
legitimacy]{.underline}.32 Saudi Arabia knows that its oil resources are
finite and thus is trying to move away from its reliance on oil and
attempt to diversify Riyadh's economic growth. In its attempt to adopt a
post-rentier style economy, Saudi Arabia is seeking to diversify its
need to export oil into other economically viable areas such as nuclear
power and renewable energy resources.33 [Saudi Arabia's diversification
strategy]{.underline} away from their reliance on oil [has allowed them
to use their vast oil resources]{.underline} not just for economic
benefit, [but as a potential political tool for leverage]{.underline} as
Riyadh seeks to expand its role in regional and international affairs.

The changing security dynamic of the Gulf region is another point that
needs to be considered in analysing the China-Saudi-Iran triangular
relationship. Historically, [military self-reliance in these states has
been politically challenging and militarily ineffective]{.underline}34.
The potential instability of the Gulf and Middle East highlights the
dangers that Gulf monarchies face when it comes to security. Gulf
monarchies have adopted a policy of 'self-reliance \[with\] regional
balancing' and maintaining connections with great powers to ensure
security in a very troubled region. In terms of military projection,
[the 'rentier dynamic in the Gulf compels states like Saudi Arabia to
seek security assurances from the great powers']{.underline}.35 [These
security assurances are traditionally linked with the US, who provide
large arms transfers, close military to military coordination and
protection under their nuclear umbrella]{.underline}.36 The Gulf states
'want to be protected, and the United States wants to protect them'.

#### US arms sales to MBS encourage "pragmatic" adventurism that destabilizes the Middle East -- Syria, Yemen, the Gulf.

Iain **MacGillivray 18** {GRI Commissioning Editor and an Independent
Political Risk Analyst, "Maturing Sino-Saudi strategic relations and

[A succession of crises]{.underline} in the region including the
Iran-Iraq war, the 1991 and 2003 Gulf wars, and finally the Syrian and
Qatar crises [have done nothing to assuage the distrust between these
two powers]{.underline} in the region. However, the probability of
direct conflict between the two states is low. [There has been in the
recent decade]{.underline}, however, [a push by both states to fund and
promote their own interests within conflicts in the region which has led
to further problematic issues in the greater Middle East. The backing of
Sunni forces by Saudi Arabia in]{.underline} the [Syria]{.underline}n
Civil War [and direct Saudi Arabian engagement in Yemen has shown
a]{.underline} more pragmatic and [forceful use of Saudi power
projection to stop Iranian influence]{.underline}.52 Iran has as well
used its growing position in the region to extend support to Shia
militia groups, not just in the Levant, but also in Syria, Iraq and
Yemen. This regional rivalry between the two powers is slowly eroding
the stability of the Middle East. Crown Prince [M]{.underline}ohammad
[B]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman['s more pragmatic approach to
foreign policy in containing]{.underline} perceived
[Iran]{.underline}ian influence (e.g. in Yemen) [has heightened the
already conflicted tensions in the wider Middle East. Continued
adventurism by Riyadh could alter the traditional security relationship
between Saudi Arabia and the US.]{.underline} Further alliances with
other powers who have an interest in the region (such as China) is
therefore necessary to continue balancing against growing Iranian
influence.

For the meantime, [the US will continue to maintain their commitments
towards Saudi Arabia even in the aftermath of the]{.underline}
conclusion of the [JCPOA]{.underline}.53 The JCPOA was essentially
apolitical in terms of policy moderation towards Iran. [Lingering
mistrusts, and domestic considerations will continue to mean that the US
will attempt to maintain strong security relations with Saudi Arabia to
counterbalance Iranian influence and power projection in the Gulf and
Levant]{.underline}. It is interesting to note that with the advent of
the Trump administration, Saudi Arabia has been pursuing a re-engagement
with its relationship with the US to promote their more pragmatic
interests in the Gulf and circumvent growing Iranian influence. Donald
[Trump's first visit as head of state to the Kingdom highlights the
importance of this relationship with **increased arms deals** and
security coordination.]{.underline}54 However, Trump has pushed for
[greater security coordination between the Arab countries. Given the
current conditions of the region,]{.underline} this [seems highly
unlikely]{.underline}. It is too early to speculate how well the
Saudi--US relationship will develop under the Trump administration, but
the growing presence of China presents another option for Saudi Arabia
to gain leverage on growing Iranian power projection in the region.55

#### Security assurances without consequences enable Saudi to play both sides with the US and China, creating an [inherently instable Middle East]{.underline}.

As [the strategic partnership between Riyadh and Beijing]{.underline}
grows stronger and solidifies, this [has growing repercussions for
regional security and could alter the projection of US
power]{.underline} in the Middle East. While this relationship continues
to grow more strategic in its outlook and perception, [an empowered
Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and China [have the capacity to offset the
balance of power in their favour]{.underline} at the expense of the US
and other states in the region. Beijing will consider Riyadh's opinion
and regional interests more wisely as substantial changes develop in the
triangular relationship between Iran, China and Saudi Arabia. [This
partnership is changing the dynamics of the region]{.underline}, and
Beijing will have to reassess its position with Tehran as strategic
bonds mature. However, this also depends on whether China and Saudi
Arabia can maintain a strong economic relationship, especially as the
price of oil continues to be at record lows and foreign policy
adventurism could cause further conflicts of interest.

[Both states will continue to confront increasing regional challenges to
their economic and political interests]{.underline}
([including]{.underline} the continued [Syria]{.underline}n Civil War
[and]{.underline} the lingering threat of the [I]{.underline}slamic
[S]{.underline}tate). [Saudi Arabia will attempt to diversify its
political engagement in the region as to secure its hold over the Gulf
particularly as it seeks regional dominance at the expense of Iran. The
US will remain as Saudi Arabia's central security relationship in the
meantime]{.underline}, however, it is possible to foresee China having
an increased political role in solving regional challenges and taking
more responsibility as the Sino-Saudi partnership deepens. Furthermore,
it is highly probable that as the strategic partnership between China
and Saudi Arabia continues to grow, US hegemony may start to diminish in
the Middle East. [For the time being though, Saudi Arabia will maintain
its delicate balancing act with China and the US as a means of promoting
its own interests in the Gulf and containment of Iran.]{.underline}
[However, **'there is something inherently unstable about a Middle East
that relies on the West for its security and the East for its
prosperity'.**]{.underline}

[Riyadh has used its power and influence to vouch for its supporters and
not countries that are against it or are fence-sitters]{.underline}.
This is aptly seen in the case of [Morocco's]{.underline} (choosing to
be non-aligned on the Qatar crisis) [failure to acquire the bid for
the]{.underline} FIFA [World Cup]{.underline} 2026[, despite the
country's military force being a part of the Saudi-led alliance against
Yemen]{.underline}. And therefore it appears that the [relations are
meant for convenience]{.underline}. This identifies the significance of
sports as a soft power that is influenced by regional conflicts and
determines the winner based on its power play in the global order. The
objective of the new cold war rivalry for Riyadh and Tehran is to wield
regional influence.

The [ongoing wars]{.underline} will [encourage more arms sales to the
region as a support to the Saudi-led alliance]{.underline}. Also, [war
has had a heavy impact on the already suffering Iranian
government]{.underline}: 'Estimates of Iran's total funding for
Hezbollah in Lebanon vary from \$60 m (£44 m) to \$1bn a year ... while
Israeli intelligence estimates Iranian backing to Islamic groups in Gaza
adds up to some \$100 m (£74 m) annually.' 15 [The sectarian rhetoric is
used as politics to convince people that there is a threat to their very
existence, thus inviting an alliance against the
opposition]{.underline}. Sadly, though, [small states and their
weaknesses will only encourage key players and their foreign allies to
use the sectarian card to achieve their geopolitical goals]{.underline}.

[The US' sole objective is guided by its relations with Saudi Arabia,
its ally Israel and its animosity towards the Islamic
Republic]{.underline}. Hence, [the Western association with the region
is strategic in nature, focused on the economy, to maintain its sphere
of influence; this has proved to be detrimental to Iran and its
allies]{.underline} (including Russia), [**causing regional mayhem**,
while Russia's limited but growing presence matters]{.underline} to the
US---[the next American president will now face an extra-regional
competitor that can complicate the US freedom of manoeuvre]{.underline}
in the area to a degree [not seen since the end of the Cold
War.]{.underline}16 [The policies of these stakeholders appear have
strategic implications for the region as a whole]{.underline}. Since
President Trump's assumption of power, [major changes in US foreign
policy have shaken West Asian political dynamics]{.underline}. This
factor appears to be [in favour of Saudi Arabia, which intends to
suppress its rivals (supporters of Iran) by applying force if
necessary]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia has not been successful in drawing
the region's security architecture, apart from showcasing the image of
Iran as a threat to peace. It is stuck with its war in Yemen and
criticised for its blockade of Qatar in 2017. The Saudi invitation to
Qatar for the GCC summit in Riyadh aims at a stable GCC. Furthermore,
quitting OPEC17 would enhance Qatar's independent policymaking and might
see the growth of the gas-based cartel, the Gas Exporting Countries
Forum (GECF).

The Trump administration has made Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates the foundation of its anti-Iran strategy. As a result[,
Washington]{.underline}, despite its avowed commitment to democracy[, is
supporting two authoritarian absolute monarchies]{.underline}. Riyadh
recently distinguished itself by murdering and dismembering a
journalistic critic in its own consulate.

Worse, however[, the Saudis and Emiratis are proving to be **the most
disruptive, destabilizing forces in the Persian Gulf.**]{.underline}
Most disastrously, in 2015 they intervened in Yemen, turning that
nation's enduring internal strife into another front in the region's
dangerous sectarian struggle.

Their brutality has been ostentatious, [bombing urban and civilian
targets, including hospitals, markets, funerals, apartments, and more,
and killing tens of thousands of non-combatants]{.underline}. The UAE
also maintained detention facilities utilizing torture, at which
American personnel have been present, though supposedly not involved in
illegal behavior. Amnesty International reported "[detailed stories of
detention at gunpoint, torture with electric shocks, waterboarding,
hanging from the ceiling, sexual humiliation, prolonged solitary
confinement, squalid conditions, inadequate food and
water]{.underline}."

[Moreover, the "coalition" led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has been
aiding America's adversaries. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)
is the most effective affiliate of the organization which downed the
twin towers. The rebel Houthis dislike America but hate AQAP even more.
However, the Saudi/Emirati assault has diverted the Houthis' attention
from dealing with America's enemies. Chaos and conflict are ever the
terrorists' friends.]{.underline}

Worse, the Emiratis/Saudis, and the nominally legitimate government of
President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi which they are supporting, have been
aiding, arming, and recruiting radical jihadist groups, including AQAP.
(Riyadh and Abu Dhabi also employ members of the Sudanese Janjaweed
militia, known for its brutality.) Last year the Associated
Press [reported](https://www.apnews.com/f38788a561d74ca78c77cb43612d50da) that
the coalition paid and recruited AQAP members and "cut secret deals with
al-Qaida fighters, paying some to leave key cities and towns and letting
others retreat with weapons, equipment and wads of looted cash."
Moreover, "Coalition-backed militias actively recruit al-Qaeda
militants, or those who were recently members, because they're
considered exceptional fighters."

Emirati money also went to the AQAP-related Abu Abbas brigade, whose
founder, Abu al-Abbas, was labeled a terrorist by Washington. "The
coalition is still supporting me," declared al-Abbas, even though his
group launched a raid which freed Al Qaeda fighters from a local
security facility. Salafist Adnan Rouzek runs a brutal force which
operates under and is subsidized by President Hadi. Rouzek's top aide is
Al Qaeda and has been regularly seen with Al Qaeda officials; his group,
explained AP, is "one of the main recruiters of al-Qaeda fighters" in
the city of Taiz. "In one case, a tribal mediator who brokered a deal
between the Emiratis and al-Qaeda even gave the extremists a farewell
dinner."

This close relationship should surprise no one[. Riyadh has spent tens
of billions of dollars supporting fundamentalist Wahhabism around the
world, including in Yemen]{.underline}. In contrast, the Houthis, a Shia
off-shoot, are relative religious moderates, even though not friendly
toward the West.

Amnesty International (AI) recently reported that Washington's nominal
allies have been "recklessly" supplying radical groups in Yemen.
Explained AI: "[the UAE has become a major conduit for armored vehicles,
mortar systems, rifles, pistols, and machine guns---which are being
**illicitly diverted to unaccountable** militias accused of war crimes
and other serious violations."]{.underline}

The issue is not just common firearms. AI discovered the same models of
U.S. and European tanks and other armored vehicles being used by
UAE-backed militias. These transfers violated U.S. and European law.
Observed AI's Patrick Wilcken: "**[Emirati forces receive billions of
dollars' worth of arms from Western states]{.underline}** and others,
**[only to siphon them off to militias in Yemen that answer to no one
and are known to be committing war crimes."]{.underline}**

[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}, in the current nuclear age, [dominate
strategy, especially the diplomacy of violence]{.underline}. Despite the
relative era of nuclear peace in the world due to the deterrence of
military strategies, unfortunately, some believed new global
developments to be shifting the international system to experience state
and non-state actors who do not believe in the concept of the deterrence
theory (Green & Wehrey 2009). The current [prolif]{.underline}eration of
nuclear programs [has once again pushed the international system into
experiencing nuclear states characterized by global radical
revolutionary objectives]{.underline}. These objectives will first serve
as a threat to their regional foes and thus, binging about proliferation
in hostile pairs which can instigate fear into the neighboring states as
they become wary of their position in the region. [The fear of a nuclear
war is becoming more eminent and realistic owing to the numerous
unstable forces that dominate the current arena.]{.underline}

[The successful development of an Iranian bomb is a threat to the
balance between the Gulf States.]{.underline} The politics of the Middle
East has over the years focused on non-proliferation of nuclear
programs. Saudi Arabia advocated for a Middle East that is free of
nuclear weapons in the 1970s as paralleled by Persian Iran and the other
Arab Gulf countries. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has Saudi Arabia
and Iran as members but due to [Saudi]{.underline}'s alliance with the
US, they [are controlled by the U.S. nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. As
per Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of States at the Nuclear
Security Summit in April 2010.

Despite these assurance claims, Iran leveraged on the invasion of Iraq
by the United States to achieve its national aim of nuclear
proliferation. It was the opinion of the experts that allowing Iran to
have nuclear weapons will inevitably compel Saudi Arabia to revive their
own interest in a nuclear program (Feickert 2013). [Saudi]{.underline}
Arabia [became worried of becoming a pawn in Iran's struggle of becoming
the sovereign nation in the Islamic World.]{.underline} Assuming Islamic
leadership and regional hegemony would definitely confer on Iran an
unparalleled power which the other leading nations would not want to
provoke. Saudi Arabia, an arch rival of Iran, is not bothered if Iran is
going to deploy the bomb against them, Israel, or the United States.
[However, the theory of deterrence is still in place, but Saudi Arabia
may not allow the diplomatic, political, and military power Iran can
achieve if allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Saudi]{.underline} Arabia
[has been forced to reconsider its position in the Middle East and to
explore its own nuclear options]{.underline} due to the growing Iranian
nuclear proliferation threat, coupled with the antagonistic public
utterances and foreign policies of Ahmadinejad. A question of the
measures that can be taken to have an international stand in place
against Iran if the Iranian government threatens the economic interests
of oil-exporting countries was raised.

[Despite whether Saudi is considering]{.underline} nuclear
[prolif]{.underline}eration or not, its [military expenditure suggests
that they are extremely conscious of]{.underline} national [security and
are making effort to strengthen their conventional army]{.underline}. A
U.S. Congressional research service report suggested that Saudi Arabia
spent USD 8.7 billion in 2008 on an agreement that borders on
arms-transfer and received the first 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft in
2009, while they increased their order for Airbus A330 MRTT
tanker/transport from an initial 2 to 6. Furthermore, consensus Military
Technology reports are suggesting a clear trend in increased missile
defense, suggesting the need for Saudi Arabia to promote deterrence
against the devastating threat of an Iranian bomb in the Middle East.
There are also indications of billion-dollar deals between Saud Arabia
and Russia as they have followed the same missile defense pattern with
the purchase of S-300 which has earlier been purchased by Iran. The case
of Saudi Arabia is incredibly significant owing to their rich and
powerful status, coupled with their continued alliance with the US; they
can engage in activities and relations that will ensure national
security without the involvement of the US (Feickert 2013). Therefore,
the world is yet again witnessing the arms race mentality that was
dominant between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold
War but this time, it is between Saudi Arabia and Iran in a region that
is dominated by fanatical religious non-state actors and unstable
authoritarian governments.

#### More likely now than ever

**Satloff Dphil, 19**

(Robert Satloff,SeniorFellow@WashingtonInst,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-04-16/commitment-issues)

Indeed, the United States is already well into executing the pullback
that Karlin and Wittes fear American leaders will resist. This should be
cause for concern, because the [authors are wrong]{.underline} about
something else, too: [that the Middle East matters]{.underline} so much
less than it once did that the United States can be indifferent about
what happens there. In fact, contrary to what Karlin and Wittes claim,
[the potential for state-on-state conflict in the Middle East is
**higher today** than at any point in the last two decades]{.underline}.
[Israel's attacks against the Iranian forward presence in
Syria,]{.underline} for example, [are ominous signs of a potential war
between Israel and Iran.]{.underline} And in the event of a conflict
between Hezbollah and Israel, if Hezbollah inflicted mass casualties on
Israel, there is a good chance that Israel would extend its retaliation
beyond Lebanon to the terrorist group's masters in Tehran[. Karlin and
Wittes also argue that because the United States is now the world's top
oil producer, energy security has decreased as a driver of U.S. policy.
But Washington still has an interest in a stable global oil market,
given its allies' reliance on Gulf energy, and in the security of the
energy-producing countries.]{.underline} Moreover, the argument [that
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should shift]{.underline}
some of the [resources]{.underline} it currently expends in the Middle
East [toward Asia fails to account for the fact that the Middle East has
always been a theater for **great-power competition.**]{.underline} [It
would be naive to think]{.underline} that [Washington can insist that
China and Russia compete]{.underline} with the United States [only where
it wants]{.underline} (in Asia and Europe) and to believe **[that these
countries will not try to fill the vacuum that a U.S. departure from the
Middle East would create]{.underline}**---especially when Russia has
already reemerged as a power broker in the heart of the region for the
first time in 50 years. Nor can one assume that the United States would
be able to easily reestablish its dominance in the region once it pulled
out. Regaining physical access to abandoned ports, bases, and airfields
would be difficult; regaining the trust and confidence of Washington's
forsaken partners, even more so. But [the biggest mistake]{.underline}
Karlin and Wittes make is that [they ignore the Middle East's tendency
to **export insecurity.**]{.underline} They suggest that Washington
should treat the Middle East with the same insouciance it displayed
toward Africa during the Cold War: a policy they say may have had
terrible consequences for Africans but was tolerable for U.S. interests.
But Africa never excelled in exporting its insecurity the way the Middle
East does. From jihadists flying airplanes into American buildings and
decapitating American prisoners to refugees streaming across the borders
of the United States' European allies, the Middle East has been a
persistent source of threats to vital U.S. interests. Such insecurity
can be met with only one of two responses: either Washington can work
with local partners to mitigate problems before they leave the Middle
East, or it can try to wall itself off from these problems. I vote for
trying to do the former, using many of the tools that Karlin and Wittes
reject as "the Goldilocks approach," such as a balanced mix of military
engagement and vigorous diplomacy.

### XT: Failed States

#### The United States' policies are not self-contained -- our support independently protects and emboldens volatile autocratic elites.

International Relations of the Middle East in the School of Government
and International Affairs at Durham University, "International politics

[The hope and disappointment that accompanied the 2011 Arab uprisings
have demonstrated the centrality of international factors in affecting
regime change and shaping transitions in the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline}. Although the impact of international factors on the
survival of authoritarian regimes has gained attention in recent years,
it remains subject to wide disagreement in both academic and policy
circles. Some scholars stress the role of democracy promoters, namely
the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), in affecting regime
change in regions with entrenched authoritarian regimes, namely in
Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East[. Others
have, however, suggested that international policies can **protect and
embolden autocratic elites** through shielding incumbent autocrats from
democratizing pressures through diplomatic and economic
support]{.underline}. In the Middle East, research has overwhelmingly
demonstrated that international powers promoted the authoritarian status
quo (Jamal 2012; Bush 2015).

Although this debate challenges the traditional schism between the two
disciplines of Comparative Politics and International Relations by
bridging domestic and international dynamics, research under this theme
remains confined to disciplinary boundaries. On the one hand, [scholars
of IR have looked at the drivers that motivate international actors to
promote democracy or support autocracy abroad. Research from this
perspective followed an IR-centred approach]{.underline}, where scholars
have focused on the policies of democracy or autocracy promoters while
paying little attention to domestic politics in target states or the
outcome of these foreign policies on other countries.

On the other hand, scholars of Comparative Politics, however, invoked
the question of 'What effect does international politics have on the
domestic structures of states?' (e.g., Burnell & Schlumberger 2010).
This strand refers to what Gourevitch (1978) coins in an oft-cited
article as [the 'second image reversed'. Whereas the international
system has been long considered a variable of secondary importance, and
sometimes even an irrelevant one, in analysing authoritarian domestic
structures, scholars argue that domestic outcomes can derive from the
exigencies of the international system.]{.underline} In this context,
the international sources of authoritarian resilience and breakdown have
been the subject of increased scrutiny. The literature has shown that
prospects of authoritarian resilience or breakdown depend in large part
on the international context, including the regime's international
alliances, relationship with the superpowers, common membership in
international organizations and cross-border relationships.

correction or Congress pushes the White House to take action," she says.
"But either way, we're going to go in the same direction."

Among the concrete steps Professor Prodromou and others expect to see in
the coming weeks:

The [nominating finally of a US ambassador to Riyadh]{.underline} to
"professionalize" the relationship and take it out of Mr. Kushner's
inexperienced hands. Renewed congressional efforts to stop arming the
Saudi-led war in Yemen. Perhaps sanctions aimed at putting on notice
Saudi Arabia -- and for that matter other US partners in the region --
that America is going to act in defense of its values and count human
rights among its vital interests. "[The Saudi relationship will become
perhaps the key metric for how seriously the world takes us for our
exercise of soft power and our commitment to universal human
rights,"]{.underline} says Prodromou, an expert in the intersection of
religion, democracy, and [security. "It's going to provide a measure of
how we're perceived in the world, of our ability to lead on human rights

dissatisfaction, and serve an important communication role in
international politics.]{.underline}

Take, for example, the U.S. relationship with Israel in the 1960s. The
United States sold Israel Hawk surface-to-surface missiles in 1962, M-48
Patton tanks in 1964 and 1965, and A-4E Skyhawk bombers in 1966. Israeli
leaders understood that these transfers signaled a close U.S.-Israeli
relationship. As diplomat Abba Eban wrote, the arms transfers were "a
development of tremendous political value." [Even against this backdrop
of close ties and significant arms sales, Israeli leaders were extremely
sensitive to arms transfer denials]{.underline}. In April and May 1967,
the United States denied Israeli requests for armored personnel carriers
and fighter jets. [Approving the transfers would have signaled support,
and likely emboldened Israel, as tensions were growing in the region.
Israeli leaders believed these transfer denials overruled prior signals
and demonstrated that the United States was not willing to be a close
political ally for Israel]{.underline}. Eban described Israel as
"isolated," and the head of Israel's intelligence service said that the
arms transfer denials made it clear that "in Israel, there existed
certain misperceptions \[about the United States\]." If arms transfer
denials could have such a significant effect on Israeli thinking ---
keeping in mind that there was a close and significant political
relationship between the US and Israel --- imagine what a transfer
denial would mean for U.S.-Saudi relations. [Like Israel, Saudi Arabia
would have to re-think its impression that it has political support and
approval from the United States]{.underline}. We can, and should, ask
whether or not withdrawal of U.S. support would affect Saudi behavior,
but it's important that this question not get overlooked in the current
debate.

Because arms transfers (and denials) are powerful signals, they can have
an effect even before a transfer is actually completed. This suggests
that even the announcement of an embargo against Saudi Arabia could have
an effect. Take, for example, Taiwan's recent request for a fleet of new
fighter jets. As reports mounted that Trump had given "tacit approval"
to a deal for F-16 jets, China's protests increased. The United States
has not sold advanced fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992, partially out
of fear of angering China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province.
Even if the deal for F-16s is formally approved, Taiwan is unlikely to
see the jets until at least 2021, and the balance of power between China
and Taiwan would not change. As one researcher observed, the sale would
be a "huge shock" for Beijing, "But it would be more of a political
shock than a military shock. It would be, 'Oh, the U.S. doesn't care how
we feel.' It would be more of a symbolic or emotional issue." Yet
China's immediate, negative reaction to even the announcement of a
potential deal shows how powerful arms transfer signals can be.

If this same logic is applied to an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia,
[an arms embargo would signal that Saudi Arabia does not have the
support of the United States]{.underline}. [This signal would be an
important first step in changing Saudi behavior because it would
override other statements and actions the United States has sent that
indicate support]{.underline}. And Trump has given Saudi Arabia a number
of positive signals: He called Saudi Arabia a "great ally" and dismissed
reports that that the Saudi government was involved in the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested in selling
nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he has
repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia (he hasn't). With these clear signals of support, why should
Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that come out of
the House or Senate, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump, anyway? [An
arms embargo would be a clear and unambiguous signal that the United
States disproves of Saudi actions in Yemen]{.underline}.

As the leader of the coalition that began military operations against
Houthi forces in Yemen on March 26, 2015, [Saudi Arabia has committed
numerous violations of international humanitarian law]{.underline}. As
of August, [at least 6,592 civilians had been killed and 10,471
wounded]{.underline}, according to the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), although the actual civilian
casualty count is likely much higher. [The majority of these casualties
were a result of coalition airstrikes.]{.underline}

[Since March 2015, Human Rights Watch has documented about 90 apparently
unlawful attacks by the coalition that have hit homes, markets,
hospitals, schools, and mosques. Some of these attacks may amount to war
crimes]{.underline}. An April coalition attack on a wedding killed 22
people and wounded more than 50. An August attack on a bus killed and
wounded dozens of children. Saudi commanders face possible criminal
liability for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.

The conflict exacerbated an existing humanitarian crisis. [The Saudi-led
coalition has imposed an aerial and naval blockade since March 2015 and
restricted the flow of life-saving goods]{.underline} and the ability
for Yemenis to travel into and out of the country to varying degrees
throughout the war.

#### US continued sales of arms to Saudi Arabia civilians risk US becoming liable to War Crimes Mohomad, **Yemen researcher at Amnesty International, 18**

(Rasha, "It's time for the U.S. to stop supplying weapons to the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen", The Washington Post, August 18 2018,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2018/08/31/its-time-for-the-u-s-to-stop-supplying-weapons-to-the-saudi-led-coalition-in-yemen/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.71504fdd7411>,

So it should come as little surprise that [a U.N.-mandated body issued a
report this week that contains a stark recommendation: It calls upon
nations to refrain from supplying weapons that could be used in the
conflict.]{.underline} And [that includes, perhaps most importantly, the
United States, which, by continuing to transfer weaponry to its Saudi
allies, may be at risk of making itself an accessory to war
crimes.]{.underline}

In one case, documented by Amnesty International, on Aug. 25, 2017, a
[U.S.-manufactured Raytheon Paveway laser-guided bomb struck civilian
homes in Yemen's largest city, Sanaa. Five-year-old Buthaina was the
sole survivor in her family]{.underline}; she lost five siblings ages 2
to 10 and both of her parents.

On Aug. 15, 2016, [a Paveway guided missile hit a fully functioning
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital, killing 11 people, including an
MSF staff member, and injuring 19 others]{.underline}. This deprived a
vulnerable population of vital health care and prompted MSF to withdraw
staff from six other hospitals in northern Yemen.

Earlier this year the [U.N. Panel of Experts published a report
presenting evidence of U.K.- and U.S.-manufactured Paveway systems used
in nine strikes]{.underline}. [They resulted in 84 civilian deaths (with
77 injured) --- 33 of them in a single incident, when a high-explosive
bomb]{.underline}, assisted by a Paveway guidance kit, struck a motel in
Arhab on Aug. 23, 2017. This is surely just the tip of the iceberg.

D[espite copious evidence of U.S. weapons --- including internationally
banned cluster munitions --- being used to carry out attacks that have
violated international humanitarian law]{.underline} (the laws of war)
and killed and injured Yemeni civilians, the Trump administration is
unrepentant. [It reversed a December 2016 Obama-era decision to suspend
transfers over concerns about civilian casualties]{.underline} and, on a
trip to Riyadh, President Trump himself touted a "tremendous" new
multibillion-dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Based on our detailed
investigations, [Amnesty International has been calling on all countries
supplying arms to immediately halt transfers and military assistance to
all parties to the conflict for use in Yemen.]{.underline}

U.S. military officials appear increasingly rattled by reports of the
deaths caused by American weapons. When pressed, Defense Secretary James
Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday that [U.S. support to
the Saudi Arabia-led coalition is "not unconditional."]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia routinely engages in HR violations even with children 

#### Human Rights Watch 18 

("Saudi Arabia Events of 2018", Human Rights Watch,
<https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/saudi-arabia>,
accessed 6/18/19, GDS -- EW)

Saudi Arabia applies Sharia (Islamic law) as its national law. There is
no formal penal code, but the government has passed some laws and
regulations that subject certain broadly-defined offenses to criminal
penalties. In the absence of a written penal code or narrowly-worded
regulations, however, judges and prosecutors can convict people on a
wide range of offenses under broad, catch-all charges such as "breaking
allegiance with the ruler" or "trying to distort the reputation of the
kingdom." [Detainees, including children, commonly face systematic
violations of due process and fair trial rights, including arbitrary
arrest.]{.underline}

[Judges routinely sentence defendants to floggings of hundreds of
lashes. Children can be tried for capital crimes and sentenced as adults
if they show physical signs of puberty.]{.underline}

During 2018, [authorities continu]{.underline}ed [to detain arrested
suspects for months, even years, without judicial review or prosecution.
Saudi Arabia's online prisoner database revealed in May that authorities
were holding 2,305 individuals who are under investigation for more than
six months]{.underline} without referring them to a judge, including 251
for over three years.

As of November, Ali al-Nimr, Dawoud al-Marhoun, Abdullah al-Zaher,
Abdulkareem al-Hawaj, and others remained on death row for allegedly
committing protest-related crimes while they were children. [Saudi
judges based the capital convictions primarily on confessions that the
defendants retracted in court and said had been coerced, and the courts
did not investigate the allegations that the confessions were obtained
by torture.]{.underline}

According to Interior Ministry statements, [Saudi Arabia executed 139
persons between January and December, mostly for murder and drug crimes.
Fifty-four of those executed were convicted for non-violent drug crimes.
Most executions are carried out by beheading, sometimes in
public.]{.underline}

#### Continued selling of weapons to Saudi Arabia risks setting a bad precedent 

#### Miller, **Global Affairs Analyst, 19**

(Aaron, "Trump\'s arms sale to Saudis undermines US values", CNN, May 28
2019,
<https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/opinions/trump-sidestep-congress-saudi-arms-opinion-miller/index.html>,
accessed 6/19/19, GDS -- EW)

As far as relations between the administration and Congress go, these
sales can only add to the already-existing tension. [Sidestepping
Congress on one of the few checks it has in the national security space
follows the dangerous precedent that Trump has set of attempting to do
as he pleases, regardless of what Congress says]{.underline}. This could
likely see a congressional reaction in the form of pushback on future
nominees that Trump tries to appoint in his administration.

Some aspects of the sales \-- such as refitting F-18 fighter aircraft
\-- aren\'t emergency sales at all, as the aircraft are not used by the
kingdom but rather sold to countries such as Israel and South Korea. And
if, in fact, [we are entering a highly fraught period with Iran that
could lead to significant military action, now is not the time to sow
further mistrust and suspicion with Congress]{.underline}.

#### Solving Human Rights sustains US credibility in the middle east 

####  Singh, **Lane-Swig Senior Fellow and managing director at The Washington Institute and a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council, 18**

(Michael, "THE UNITED STATES, SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE
POST-KHASHOGGI ERA", War on the Rocks, December 18 2018,

Second, [the United States should elevate human and civil rights in its
regional bilateral relationships. American advocacy for human and civil
rights in the Middle East]{.underline} has sharply diminished in recent
years. This backlash was evident during the Obama administration, which
associated President George W. Bush's "Freedom Agenda" with the Iraq war
and interventionism. The so-called Arab Spring of 2011 only reinforced
this trend, despite a brief, initial revival of Western enthusiasm for
political reform. Under the Trump administration, which has sought to
practice a form of realpolitik in its foreign relations, this
downplaying of human rights has only grown stronger.

The present crisis in U.S.-Saudi relations illustrates the downsides of
these shifts. The [Khashoggi affair is a reminder that neglecting human
rights concerns can not only imperil domestic U.S. support for regional
relationships]{.underline}, but also blind policymakers to the
brittleness of partner states. Downgrading human rights is convenient
when dealing with autocratic partners, but comes with a cost. [It is at
odds with American values and thus difficult to sustain domestically and
broadly damaging to American credibility.]{.underline} Policymakers
should regard the matter not merely as a moral one, but as a strategic
imperative --- repressive regimes are often prone to instability, and
those that pursue cruel policies at home rarely exercise wisdom abroad.

[U.S. officials should elevate the human rights issue in bilateral and
regional agendas and ensure that American assistance programs focused on
rights and civil society enjoy clear, high-level diplomatic
support]{.underline}. Making clear to partners that these issues will
always be a topic of conversation when high-ranking U.S. officials
visit, and that visiting officials' itineraries will include meetings
with civil society representatives, can help rein in abuses and create
space for civil society in the region, which is vital to its prosperity
and stability. [This, in turn, can contribute to sustaining domestic
U.S. support for these relationships]{.underline}. Here again, the
United States must be in it for the long haul and be prepared to take a
patient, case-by-case approach, focusing less on headline gains such as
elections and more on the incremental work of building the institutions
that are vital to resilient states.

### A2 Alt Causes

#### They're using [our]{.underline} weapons to kill civilians -- it's about resources, not attitudes. We have a chart.

Alex **Kane 5/20**/19 {Freelance journalist who writes on
Israel/Palestine and civil liberties, "Here's Exactly Who's Profiting
from the War on Yemen," *In These Times*,

Accessed 6/20/19} //RG

Under President Barack Obama's administration and, now, President Donald
Trump's, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has put its
military might behind the Saudi-led coalition]{.underline}, waging a war
without congressional authorization. That [war has devastated Yemen's
infrastructure, destroyed or damaged more than half of Yemen's health
facilities, killed more than 8,350 civilians, injured another 9,500
civilians, displaced 3.3 million people, and created a humanitarian
disaster that threatens the lives of millions as cholera and famine
spread through the country]{.underline}.

[U.S. arms merchants]{.underline}, however, [have grown rich. Fragments
of the bombs]{.underline} were documented by journalists and HRW with
help from Mastaba villagers. An HRW munitions expert [determined the
bombs were]{.underline} 2,000-pound MK-84s, [manufactured by General
Dynamics]{.underline}. Based in Falls Church, Va., General Dynamics is
the world's sixth most profitable arms manufacturer. One of [the bombs
used a satellite guidance kit from]{.underline} Chicago-based
[Boeing]{.underline}, the world's second-most profitable weapons
company. [The other bomb had a]{.underline} Paveway [guidance system,
made by either Raytheon]{.underline} of Waltham, Mass., the
third-largest arms company in the world, [or Lockheed
Martin]{.underline} of Bethesda, Md., the world's top weapons
contractor. An In These Times analysis found that in the past decade,
[the State Department has approved at least \$30.1 billion in Saudi
military contracts for these four companies.]{.underline}

[The war in Yemen has been particularly lucrative for General Dynamics,
Boeing and Raytheon]{.underline}, which have received hundreds of
millions of dollars in Saudi weapons deals. All three corporations have
highlighted business with Saudi Arabia in their reports to shareholders.
Since the war began in March 2015, General Dynamics' [stock price has
risen]{.underline} from about \$135 to \$169 per share, Raytheon's from
about \$108 to more than \$180, and Boeing's from about \$150 to \$360.

Lockheed Martin declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for
Boeing said the company follows "guidance from the United States
government," while Raytheon replied, "You will need to contact the U.S.
government." General Dynamics did not respond to inquiries. The State
Department declined to comment on the record.

[The weapons contractors are correct on one point: They're working
hand-in-glove with the State Department.]{.underline} By law, the
department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs must approve any arms
sales by U.S. companies to foreign governments. [U.S. law also prohibits
sales to countries that indiscriminately kill civilians, as the
Saudi-led military coalition bombing Yemen did in the Mastaba strike and
many other documented cases.]{.underline} But ending sales to Saudi
Arabia would cost the U.S. arms industry its biggest global customer,
and to do so, Congress must cross an industry that pours millions into
the campaigns of lawmakers of both parties.

### XT-Soft Power Impacts

#### The decline of soft power leads to internal revolts 

####  Li, venture capitalist and political scientist in Shanghai,18 

(Eric, "The Rise and Fall of Soft Power", foreign policy.com, August 20
2018,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/20/the-rise-and-fall-of-soft-power/>,
accessed 6/20/19, GDS -- EW)

One theory for why is that the neoliberal economic revolution, [which
was part and parcel of the soft power era, weakened states instead of
strengthening them]{.underline}. The market was never a uniting
force---the idea that it could be an all-encompassing mechanism to
provide growth, good governance, and societal well-being was an illusion
to begin with. The German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck elaborated on
this idea at a conference in Taiwan this summer. Soft power
globalization, he warned, is simply "outpacing the capacity of national
societies and international organizations to build effective
institutions of economic and political governance." In turn, "increasing
debt, rising inequality, and unstable growth" is leading to "a general
crisis of political-economic governability[." That crisis has resulted
in internal revolts on soft power's home turf.]{.underline} Streeck
calls it "taking back control." You [might call it the rise of America's
Donald Trump, Hungary's Viktor Orban, or Italy's Five Star Movement and
the League.]{.underline}

So far[, such revolts have resulted in anti-liberal governing majorities
in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the United
States]{.underline}---and that is just among developed countries. Such
is the sorry state of [soft power liberalism that it has had trouble
holding on even in places where it should have had the best chances of
surviving]{.underline}.

#### The decline of soft power leads to a lack of leadership in solving trade agreements and the environment Lehmann, 16

(Jean-Pierre, "The Collapse Of US Soft Power - Global Impacts", Forbes,
April 28 2016,

accessed 6/22/19, GDS -- EW)

Global governance is adrift. Much of this arises from the lack of
leadership, [the absence of soft power, of the US, and its inability to
adjust to the new global realities, notably the rise of
China]{.underline}. Apart from the Middle East/North Africa quagmire,
American leadership has been found most wanting on the global trade
front. The failure of the Doha Development Agenda [and the consequent
impotence and irrelevance of the WTO is in most part an American
concoction. The attempt to substitute the multilateral trade system with
the new-fangled "mega-regionals]{.underline}", à la TPP (Trans-Pacific
Partnership) and TTIP (Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership),
[is not only a mistake, as I have argued on a number of occasions in
this column, but they are also likely to fail.]{.underline} The
protectionist tone of the current presidential candidates is, to say the
least, unnerving.

A [similar verdict of leaderless-ness]{.underline} (or indeed leading in
the wrong direction) would apply to a number of other major unmet issues
facing the planet[. On environment and climate change, there has been a
modest improvement with the Obama administration]{.underline}, though
not to the extent that anyone can seriously speak of American leadership
-- [in many ways the US, as great polluter, remains a major part of the
problem, rather than providing solutions, let alone leading by
example]{.underline}.

#### The fall of global democracy leads to xenophobic populist movements

Affairs, April 17 2018,

"The long century during which Western liberal democracies dominated the
globe has ended for good," write Harvard University lecturer Yascha
Mounk and University of Melbourne lecturer Roberto Stefan Foa. They
argue that [such governments have gotten worse at delivering economic
growth, whereas authoritarian states have gotten better at doing
so]{.underline}. "The only remaining question now is whether democracy
will transcend its once firm anchoring in the West, a shift that would
create the conditions for a truly global democratic century---or whether
democ­racy will become, at best, the lingering form of government in an
economically and demographically declining corner of the world."

"The immediate cause of [rising support for authoritarian, xenophobic
populist movements is a reaction against immigration (and, in the United
States, rising racial equality]{.underline})," observes University of
Michigan Professor Ronald Inglehart. He warns that the world is
experiencing the most severe democratic setback since the rise of
fascism in the 1930s. "But all is not lost. [Today's democratic decline
can be reversed," he writes, "if rich countries address the growing
inequality of recent decades and manage the transition to the automated
economy."]{.underline}

#### The fall of global democracy results in decreased civil rights

( "Democracy in Retreat" , Freedom House,
<https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat>,
accessed 6/22/19, GDS -- EW)

So far it has been [antiliberal populist movements of the far
right---those that emphasize national sovereignty, are hostile to
immigration]{.underline}, and reject constitutional checks on the will
of the majority---that have been most effective at seizing the open
political space. In countries from Italy to Sweden, antiliberal
politicians have shifted the terms of debate and won elections by
promoting an exclusionary national identity as a means for frustrated
majorities to gird themselves against a changing global and domestic
order. [By building alliances with or outright capturing mainstream
parties on the right, antiliberals have been able to launch attacks on
the institutions designed to protect minorities against abuses and
prevent monopolization of power]{.underline}. Victories for antiliberal
movements in Europe and the United States in recent years have
emboldened their counterparts around the world, as seen most recently in
the election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil.

These movements damage democracies internally through their dismissive
[attitude toward core civil and political rights, and they weaken the
cause of democracy around the world with their unilateralist
reflexes.]{.underline} For example, antiliberal leaders' attacks on the
media have contributed to increasing polarization of the press,
including political control over state broadcasters, and to growing
physical threats against journalists in their countries. At the same
time, such attacks have provided cover for authoritarian leaders abroad,
who now commonly cry "fake news" when squelching critical coverage.

### XT-Democracy Impact 

#### Continued populist rise erodes the liberal order and generates global chaos

**de Waal,** Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation at the
Fletcher School at Tufts University, **2016** (Alex, "Garrison America
and the Threat of Global War" Boston Review, December 5,

accessed 6/23/19, GDS -- EW)

[Trump's promises have been so vague that it will be hard for him to
disappoint]{.underline}. Nonetheless, many of his supporters will wake
up to the fact that they have been duped, or realize the futility of
voting for a wrecker out of a sense of alienated desperation. The
progressives' silver lining to the 2016 election is that, had Clinton
won, the Trump constituency would have been back in four years' time,
probably with a more ruthless and ideological candidate[. Better for
plutocratic populism to fail early]{.underline}. But [the damage
inflicted in the interim could be terrible---even
irredeemable]{.underline} if it were to include swinging a wrecking ball
at the Paris Climate Agreement out of simple ignorant malice.

Polanyi recounts [how economic and financial crisis led to global
calamity]{.underline}. Something similar could happen today. In fact we
are already in a steady unpicking of the liberal peace that glowed at
the turn of the millennium. Since approximately 2008, [the historic
decline in the number and lethality of wars appears to have been
reversed]{.underline}. Today's wars are not like World War I, with
formal declarations of war, clear war zones, rules of engagement, and
definite endings. But they are wars nonetheless.

What does a world in global, generalized war look like? We have an
unwinnable "war on terror" that is metastasizing with every escalation,
and [which has blurred the boundaries between war and everything
else]{.underline}. We [have deep states---built on a new oligarchy of
generals, spies, and private-sector suppliers]{.underline}---that are
strangling liberalism. [We have]{.underline} [emboldened middle
powers]{.underline} (such as Saudi Arabia) and revanchist powers (such
as Russia) rearming and taking unilateral military action across borders
(Ukraine and Syria). We have massive profiteering from conflicts by the
arms industry, as well as through the corruption and organized crime
that follow in their wake (Afghanistan[). We have impoverishment and
starvation through economic warfare]{.underline}, the worst case being
Yemen. [We have "peacekeeping" forces fighting wars]{.underline}
(Somalia). We have regional rivals threatening one another, some with
nuclear weapons (India and Pakistan) and others with possibilities of
acquiring them (Saudi Arabia and Iran).

Above all, [today's generalized war is a conflict of destabilization,
with big powers intervening in the domestic politics of
others,]{.underline} buying influence in their security establishments,
bribing their way to big commercial contracts and thereby corroding
respect for government, and manipulating public opinion through the
media. Washington, D.C., and Moscow each does this in its own way. Put
the pieces together and a global political market of rival plutocracies
comes into view. Add [virulent reactionary]{.underline} [populism to the
mix and it resembles a war on democracy.]{.underline}

What more might we see? [Economic liberalism is a creed of optimism and
abundance]{.underline}; reactionary protectionism feeds on pessimistic
scarcity. If [we see punitive trade wars and national leaders taking
preemptive action to secure strategic resources within the walls of
their garrison states]{.underline}, then old-fashioned territorial
disputes along with accelerated state-commercial grabbing of land and
minerals are in prospect. We [could see mobilization against immigrants
and minorities as a way of enflaming and rewarding a constituency that
can police borders, enforce the new political rightness, and even become
electoral vigilantes.]{.underline}

Liberal multilateralism is a system of seeking common wins through
peaceful negotiation; case-by-case power dealing is a zero-sum calculus.
[We may see regional arms races, nuclear proliferation, and
opportunistic power coalitions to exploit the weak]{.underline}. In such
a global political marketplace, we would see middle-ranking and junior
states rewarded for the toughness of their bargaining, and foreign
policy and security strategy delegated to the CEOs of oil companies,
defense contractors, bankers, and real estate magnates.

The United Nations system appeals to leaders to live up to the highest
standards. The fact that they so often conceal their transgressions is
the tribute that vice pays to virtue. A cabal of plutocratic populists
would revel in the opposite: applauding one another's readiness to tear
up cosmopolitan liberalism and pursue a latter-day mercantilist naked
self-interest. [Garrison America could opportunistically collude with
similarly constituted political-military business regimes in Russia,
China, Turkey, and elsewhere]{.underline} for a new realpolitik global
concert, redolent of the early nineteenth-century era of the Congress of
Vienna, bringing a façade of stability for as long as they collude---and
war when they fall out.

And [there is a danger that, in response to a terrorist outrage or an
international political crisis, President Trump will do something
stupid]{.underline}, just as Europe's leaders so unthinkingly strolled
into World War I. The multilateral security system is in poor health and
may not be able to cope.

Underpinning this is a simple truth: [the plutocratic populist order is
a future that does not work]{.underline}. If illustration were needed of
the logic of hiding under the blanket rather than facing difficult
realities, look no further than Trump's readiness to deny climate
change.

( "Democracy in Retreat" , Freedom House,
<https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat>,
accessed 6/22/19, GDS -- EW)

Another norm under siege is protection of the [rights of migrants and
refugees]{.underline}, [including the rights to due process, to freedom
from discrimination, and to seek asylum]{.underline}. All countries have
the legitimate authority to regulate migration, but they must do so in
line with international human rights standards and without violating the
fundamental principles of justice provided by their own laws and
constitutions. [Antiliberal populist leaders have increasingly demonized
immigrants and asylum seekers and targeted them for discriminatory
treatment]{.underline}, often using them as scapegoats to marginalize
any political opponents who come to their defense. In Freedom in the
World, eight democracies have suffered score declines in the past four
years alone due to their treatment of migrants. With some 257 million
people estimated to be in migration around the world, the persistent
assault on the rights of migrants is a significant threat to human
rights and a potential catalyst for other attacks on democratic
safeguards.

In addition to mistreating those who arrive in their territory in search
of work or protection, a growing number of governments are reaching
beyond their borders to target expatriates[, exiles, and
diasp]{.underline}oras. Freedom House found 24 countries around the
world---including heavyweights like Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, and
Saudi Arabia---[that have recently targeted political dissidents abroad
with practices such as harassment, extradition requests, kidnapping, and
even assassination]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia's murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey put a spotlight on authoritarian regimes'
aggressive pursuit of prominent critics. Turkey itself, which has sought
to keep Khashoggi's murder on the front pages, has by its own account
captured 104 of its citizens from 21 countries over the last two years
in a global crackdown on perceived enemies of the state. Beijing's
growing apparatus for policing opinions and enforcing its views among
Chinese citizens and communities overseas has led to outcomes including
the forced repatriation of Uighurs from countries where they sought
safety and the surveillance of Chinese students at foreign universities.
Interpol's notification system has become a tool for authoritarian
governments to detain and harass citizens in exile. The normalization of
such transnational violence and harassment would not just shut down the
last refuges for organized opposition to many repressive regimes. It
would also contribute to a broader breakdown in international law and
order, a world of borderless persecution in which any country could be a
hunting ground for spies and assassins dispatched by tyrants looking to
crush dissent.

Most disturbingly, Freedom House's global survey shows that ethnic
cleansing is a growing trend. In 2005, Freedom [in the World reduced the
scores of just three countries for ethnic cleansing or other egregious
efforts to alter the ethnic composition of their territory]{.underline};
this number has since grown to 11, and in some cases the scale or
intensity of such activities has increased over time as well[. In Syria
and Myanmar, hundreds of thousands of civilians from certain ethnic and
religious groups have been killed or displaced as world powers either
fail to respond adequately or facilitate the violence]{.underline}.
Russia's occupation of Crimea has included targeted repression of
Crimean Tatars and those who insist on maintaining their Ukrainian
identity. China's mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslims---with
some 800,000 to 2 million people held arbitrarily in "reeducation"
camps---can only be interpreted as a superpower's attempt to annihilate
the distinct identities of minority groups.

### Soft Power -- Terror 

#### The fall of US soft power leads us to not cooperate to stop things like terrorism Nye, Distinguished Service Professor and former Dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, 18

February 12 2018,
<https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/donald-trump-decline-us-soft-power/>,
accessed 6/22/19, GDS -- EW)

[Skeptics might still argue that the rise and fall of American soft
power does not matter much]{.underline}, because countries cooperate out
of self-interest. But this argument misses a crucial point[: cooperation
is a matter of degree, and the degree is affected by attraction or
repulsion]{.underline}. Moreover, the effects of a country's soft power
extend to non-state actors---for example, [by aiding or impeding
recruitment by terrorist organisations]{.underline}. In an information
age, success depends not only on whose army wins, but also on whose
story wins.

[One of the greatest sources of America's soft power is the openness of
its democratic processes. Even when mistaken policies reduce its
attractiveness]{.underline}, America's ability to criticise and correct
its mistakes makes it attractive to others at a deeper level. When
protesters overseas were marching against the Vietnam War, they often

(Robert,"After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic
Effects," Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July
2010, accessed 6/23/19, GDS -- EW)

[A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in
response by the country attacked in the first place, would not
necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds
imaginable.]{.underline} Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether
nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category
of [truly existential threats]{.underline}. A contrast can be drawn here
with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear
exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these
weapons in significant numbers. Even the [worst terrorism that the
twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance
alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have
wrought in the Cold War period.]{.underline} And it must be admitted
that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even
thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the
possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated
entirely by state possessors themselves.

But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor nuclear attack and a
catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and
especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of
events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or
more of the states that possess them. [In this context, today's and
tomorrow's terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the
early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals
who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between
the superpowers started by third parties]{.underline}. These risks were
considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about
nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem.

It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an
especially plausible situation where an act [of nuclear terrorism could
lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war]{.underline}. For
example[, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United
States]{.underline}, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or
China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because
they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or
encouragers of terrorist groups[. They would seem far too responsible to
be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could
just as easily threaten them as well.]{.underline}

Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example,
how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that
the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from
Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any
responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that
nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science
fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the
debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be "spread over a wide
area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable,
identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be
obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the
materials used and, most important ... some indication of where the
nuclear material came from."41

Alternatively, if the act [of nuclear terrorism came as a complete
surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist
group was fully responsible (or responsible at all) suspicion would
shift immediately to state possessors]{.underline}. Ruling out Western
ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel
and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very
short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program
continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and
China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear
Cluedo?

In particular, [if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a
backdrop of existing tension in Washington's relations with Russia
and/or China]{.underline}, and at a time when threats had already been
traded between these major powers, [would officials and political
leaders not be tempted to assume the worst?]{.underline} Of course, the
chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United
States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with
Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a
distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at
the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear
terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened
tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow
and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to
consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of
the attack?

[Washington's early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own
soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided)
confrontation with Russia and/or China]{.underline}. For example, in the
noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist
nuclear attack, [the U.S. president might be expected to place the
country's armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage
of alert]{.underline}. In such a tense environment, when careful
planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible
that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S.
intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. [In
that situation, the temptations to preempt such actions might grow,
although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still
meet with a devastating response.]{.underline}

#### The fall of US soft power leads us to not cooperate to stop things like terrorism 

#### Nye, Distinguished Service Professor and former Dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, 18

(Joseph, "Donald Trump and the decline of US soft power" , ASPI,
February 12 2018,
<https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/donald-trump-decline-us-soft-power/>,
accessed 6/22/19, GDS -- EW)

[Skeptics might still argue that the rise and fall of American soft
power does not matter much]{.underline}, because countries cooperate out
of self-interest. But this argument misses a crucial point[: cooperation
is a matter of degree, and the degree is affected by attraction or
repulsion]{.underline}. Moreover, the effects of a country's soft power
extend to non-state actors---for example, [by aiding or impeding
recruitment by terrorist organisations]{.underline}. In an information
age, success depends not only on whose army wins, but also on whose
story wins.

[One of the greatest sources of America's soft power is the openness of
its democratic processes. Even when mistaken policies reduce its
attractiveness]{.underline}, America's ability to criticise and correct
its mistakes makes it attractive to others at a deeper level. When
protesters overseas were marching against the Vietnam War, they often
sang 'We Shall Overcome', the anthem of the US civil rights movement.

## 1ac -- Yemen 

#### Saudi Arabia uses US arms to attack Yemen---Trump's recent refusal to halt sales [further emboldens]{.underline} them

**La Forgia and Bogdanich 6/7**- (Michael, a Pulitzer Prize winning
investigative reporter for the New York Times and Walt, an investigative
reporter for the New York Times Business and Finance Desk, "Trump Allows
High Tech U.S. Bomb Parts to Be Built in Saudi Arabia," New York Times,
2019,
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/saudi-arabia-arms-sales-raytheon.html)

[When the Trump administration declared an emergency last month and
fast-tracked the sale of more American arms to Saudi Arabia, it did more
than anger members of Congress who opposed the sale on humanitarian
grounds.]{.underline}

[It also raised concerns that the Saudis could gain access to technology
that would let them produce their own versions of American
precision-guided bombs --- weapons they have used in strikes on
civilians since they began fighting [a war in
Yemen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/middleeast/saudi-yemen-airstrikes-civilians.html?module=inline) four
years ago.]{.underline}

[The [emergency
authorization](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/middleeast/trump-troop-increase-middle-east-iran.html?module=inline) allows
Raytheon Company, a top American defense firm, to team with the Saudis
to build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} That
provision, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broad
package of information the administration released this week to
Congress.

The move grants Raytheon and the Saudis sweeping permission to begin
assembling the control systems, guidance electronics and circuit cards
that are essential to the company's Paveway smart bombs. The United
States has closely guarded such technology for national security
reasons.

[Multiple reports by human rights groups over the past four years have
singled out the weapons as being used in airstrikes on
civilians.]{.underline} One attack, on a Sana funeral home in October
2016, led the Obama administration to suspend bomb sales to the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.

[The new arrangement is part of a larger arms package, previously
blocked by Congress, that includes 120,000 precision-guided bombs that
Raytheon is prepared to ship to the coalition. These will add to the
tens of thousands of bombs that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates have already stockpiled, and some in Congress fear the surplus
would let the countries continue fighting in Yemen long into the
future.]{.underline} The move also includes support for Saudi F-15
warplanes, mortars, anti-tank missiles and .50-caliber rifles.

#### US support for Saudi Arabia through arms sales is the [driving force]{.underline} of the Yemen conflict

in the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University
and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and Caroline Dorminey is

Needs to Change Its Arms Sales Policy" *Defense One*. Mar 21, 2018

This approach to [arms sales invites negative downstream
consequences]{.underline}. Shockingly, in most recent military
interventions, [U.S. troops have faced adversaries armed with
American-made weapons. Indeed, U.S. arms exports tend to fuel conflicts
abroad]{.underline}. This is particularly true in the Middle East, where
almost every nation has been directly involved in a conflict in the last
five years, and whose nations account for 49 percent of total American
exports over that same period.

[Yemen illustrates how arms sales can make a conflict
worse]{.underline}. In 2015, the Obama administration made the decision
to provide support to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen's civil war.
The [Saudis, backed by U.S.]{.underline} logistical aid, arms sales, and
intelligence support, have [conducted thousands of airstrikes against
civilian targets including hospitals, schools, and food production
facilities in violation of the rules of war.]{.underline} The war has
also generated what United Nations agencies have called the [**world's
worst humanitarian crisis**, displacing more than two million Yemenis
and killing more than 10,000.]{.underline}

[Instead of working to convince the Saudis to end their horrific
campaign, the administration has **continued providing military support
and expanded arms sales** to Saudi Arabia despite several members of
Congress raising grave concerns.]{.underline} Weapons sold to Saudi
Arabia after the start of hostilities include \$500 million worth of
precision-guided munitions used in the kingdom's air campaign, along
with aircraft, helicopters, tanks, and armored vehicles. Not only does
this make the [**United States complicit in war crimes in Yemen**,
selling major conventional weapons to states actively engaged in a
conflict prolong those conflicts]{.underline}.

Few nations have large enough arsenals to fight conflicts for extended
periods of time without resupply. This is particularly true of nations
without large domestic defense industries that rely heavily on arms
imports to sustain combat operations. [Saudi Arabia was the
second-largest arms importer worldwide from 2013-17, and **increased its
imports 225 percent** over the previous five years, partly **in order to
fight its war on Yemen**.]{.underline}

#### Instability and the Yemen war are the perfect storm for a unchecked AQAP uprising, threatening the US and countries around the globe

Greg **Botelho**, Cnn, 1-24-20**15**, \"What\'s happening in the Middle
East and why it matters,\" CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/23/middleeast/middle-east-country-breakdown/

[The Middle East has never been a simple place.]{.underline}

Yet [nowadays, this region is especially turbulent]{.underline} \-- with
[waves rocking several countries, so big that their **effects are being
felt worldwide, including the West**]{.underline}.

[It\'s not like this uneasiness is concentrated only in one country, or
all for a common reason]{.underline}. There\'s [Islamic extremism,
political turnover, faltering oil prices and, let\'s not forget, age-old
sectarian tensions that are contributing in different ways in different
places to the tumult]{.underline}.

Many countries in the region have issues, such as Egypt\'s delicate
political and human rights situation and Turkey\'s dealing with the
impact of the war raging right over its border in Syria. Still, a few
stand out because of the unique \-- some might say intractable \--
challenges they face.

YEMEN

[Chaos is one way to describe it.]{.underline}

The [country\'s government is in a shambles]{.underline}.
[Violence]{.underline} \-- some of it sectarian, some of it thanks to
militancy from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) \-- has been
[raging nationwide for months, if not years]{.underline}. And it\'s far
and away the poorest nation in the region, with a per capita GDP of
\$1,473, according to the World Bank. (Compare that with Saudi Arabia\'s
\$25,962.)

Let\'s start with the still unfolding political crisis. Yemen\'s
President and Prime Minister abruptly resigned Thursday after Houthi
rebels moved on the capital, Sana\'a.

How Yemen\'s new government will look is still unclear, if it\'s going
to have a functioning government at all. If the Houthis take the lead,
that would mean Shiites ruling a country that\'s mostly Sunni. While the
Houthis and previous government both fought against al Qaeda, this
**[instability can only help that terror group]{.underline}**. And none
of this is helping the average Yemeni stuck in poverty, with little
time, money or effort seemingly focused on improving their straits or
the economy as a whole.

[For the rest of the world, political stability is a good thing for any
country in this region]{.underline}; on the flip side, [instability is
always a concern]{.underline}. There\'s also the fact that [Yemen has
enough oil and natural gas for its people and export]{.underline},
though [unrest makes it challenging to tap into these
resources]{.underline}, the U.S. Energy Information Administration
notes.

[All those worries and impacts are real]{.underline}. But, [for the
West, it\'s about AQAP]{.underline}.

Ever since Osama bin Laden was flushed out of Afghanistan, the terrorist
organization he founded has spread out and evolved. Rather than one
overarching entity, al Qaeda is now more of an association of groups \--
each with its own goals, even if they [all share a philosophy of lashing
out at the West and promoting their extreme brand of Islam.]{.underline}

And of those, [AQAP is widely considered the most dangerous to the
West.]{.underline}

It\'s the only al Qaeda affiliate to send terrorists from Yemen to the
United States. There was Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, better known as
\"the underwear bomber\" for his attempt to blow up a commercial
airliner on a Detroit-bound flight in December 2009. Then there are the
suspects in the deadly Boston Marathon bombings and Nidal Hassan, who
reportedly were inspired by American-born cleric and top AQAP figure
Anwar al-Awlaki.

[The United States isn\'t the only place affected]{.underline}. AQAP has
claimed to be behind the January 7 Charlie Hebdo massacre, and one of
the brothers involved \-- Cherif Kouachi \-- told CNN affiliate BFM that
he trained in Yemen on a trip financed by al-Awlaki.

Al-Awlaki is dead, but his organization is not. [With both Yemen\'s
government and the Houthis focused on each other, AQAP has more space to
**recruit and train** terrorists, as well as **devise ways for them to
strike.**]{.underline}

[Yemen\'s political upheaval is especially unsettling for countries like
the United States]{.underline}, which had a strong, working alliance
with now-departed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and his government.
As of Thursday, U.S. officials haven\'t held any talks with the Houthis,
nor did they know their intentions.

**Independently, US weapons are diverted to terrorist groups \-\--
conditions on sales agreements [don't work]{.underline}**

**Elbagir, Abdelaziz, El Gheit, and Smith-Spark 19** (Nima,

East Editor on CNN\'s International desk, Mohamed, and Laura, February

Hodeidah, Yemen (CNN) -- [Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have
transferred American-made weapons to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline
Salafi militias, and other factions waging war in Yemen, in violation of
their agreements with the United States]{.underline}, a CNN
investigation has found.

[The weapons have also made their way into the hands of Iranian-backed
rebels]{.underline} battling the coalition for control of the country,
[exposing some of America\'s sensitive military tech]{.underline}nology
to Tehran [and]{.underline} potentially [endangering the lives of US
troops]{.underline} in other conflict zones.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its main partner in the war,
have used the US-manufactured weapons as a form of currency to buy the
loyalties of militias or tribes, bolster chosen armed actors, and
influence the complex political landscape, according to local commanders
on the ground and analysts who spoke to CNN.

[By handing off this military equipment to third parties, the Saudi-led
coalition is **breaking the terms of its arms sales** with the
US,]{.underline} according to the Department of Defense. After CNN
presented its findings, a US defense official confirmed there was an
ongoing investigation into the issue.

The revelations raise fresh questions about whether the US has lost
control over a key ally presiding over one of the most horrific wars of
the past decade, and whether Saudi Arabia is responsible enough to be
allowed to continue buying the sophisticated arms and fighting hardware.
Previous CNN investigations established that [US-made weapons were used
in a series of deadly Saudi coalition attacks that killed dozens of
civilians, many of them children.]{.underline}

The developments also come as Congress, outraged with Riyadh over the
murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, considers whether to
force an end to the Trump administration\'s support for the Saudi
coalition, which relies on American weapons to conduct its war.In [2015,
Riyadh launched a coalition to oust Iranian-supported Houthi rebels from
the country\'s capital and reinstate the internationally recognized
government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The war split the
country in two]{.underline}, and with it came the weapons \-- not just
guns, but anti-tank missiles, armored vehicles, heat-seeking lasers and
artillery \-- all flooding into an unruly and complex state.

[Since then,]{.underline} some of America\'s \"beautiful [military
equipment]{.underline},\" as US President Donald Trump once called it,
[has been **passed on, sold, stolen or abandoned** in Yemen\'s state of
chaos, where murky alliances and fractured politics mean **little hope
for any system of accountability or tracking**.]{.underline}

[Some **terror groups have gained from the influx of US arms**, with the
**barrier of entry to advanced weaponry now lowered by the laws of
supply and demand**. Militia leaders have had ample opportunity to
obtain military hardware in exchange for the manpower to fight the
Houthi militias.]{.underline} Arms dealers have flourished, with traders
offering to buy or sell anything, from a US-manufactured rifle to a
tank, to the highest bidder.

[And Iran\'s proxies have captured American weapons they can exploit for
vulnerabilities or reverse-engineer for native production.]{.underline}

\'Do you have American guns here?\'

In the narrow, ramshackle streets of Taiz\'s historic district, weapons
shops lie tucked between women\'s clothing stores.

Arms markets are illegal in Yemen, but that doesn\'t stop them operating
openly in this large, mountainous city in the country\'s southwest. In
one arms market, sweets were displayed among the ammunition. \"Do you
have American guns here?\" CNN asked. \"The American guns are expensive
and sought after,\" the weapons trader replied, in an exchange captured
by undercover CNN cameras.

To one side hang veils, abayas and colorful dresses for sale; to the
other are pistols, hand grenades, and US assault rifles available on
special order.

In another of the city\'s markets, a very young-looking boy handled
weapons like an expert. Men joked and chewed khat, a commonly used drug,
and the atmosphere was casual. But these shops don\'t just take
individual orders, they can supply militias \-- and it\'s this
not-so-hidden black market that in part is driving the demand for
hi-tech American weapons and perpetuating the cycle of violence in
Yemen.

Once the intellectual heart of the country, Taiz is now a tinder box
that set off a war within a war last year, when the various militias
backed by the Saudi-led coalition turned their guns on each other.

Amid the chaos of the broader war[, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
(AQAP) made its way to the frontlines in Taiz in 2015, forging
advantageous alliances with the pro-Saudi militias they fought
alongside.]{.underline}

[One of those militias linked to AQAP, the Abu Abbas brigade, now
possesses US-made Oshkosh armored vehicles]{.underline}, paraded in a
2015 show of force through the city.

Abu Abbas, the founder, was declared a terrorist by the US in 2017, but
the group still enjoys support from the Saudi coalition and was absorbed
into the coalition-supported 35th Brigade of the Yemeni army.

"Oshkosh Defense strictly follows all US laws and regulations relating
to export control,\" the firm told CNN.And there are deadlier forms of
weaponry that have made their way into the city. In October 2015,
military forces loyal to the government boasted on Saudi- and UAE-backed
media that the Saudis had airdropped American-made TOW anti-tank
missiles on the same frontline where AQAP had been known to operate at
the time.

Local officials confirmed that the airdrop happened, but CNN\'s attempts
to conduct further interviews were blocked and the team was intimidated
by the local government. A local activist joked that the weapons had
probably been sold on.

Graveyard of US military hardware

[At a graveyard of discarded US-made military hardware near the
flashpoint port city of Hodeidah, it becomes clear that the Alwiyat al
Amalqa \-- the Giants Brigade, a predominantly Salafi, or
ultra-conservative Sunni, militia \-- is a favored faction.]{.underline}

Nearly half a dozen Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles sit
side by side, most bearing stickers with the insignia of the Giants
Brigade.

One even has the export label on it showing it was sent from Beaumont,
Texas to Abu Dhabi, in the UAE, before ending up in the hands of the
militia. The serial number of another MRAP reveals it was manufactured
by Navistar, the largest provider of armored vehicles for the US
military.The armored all-terrain vehicles are built to withstand
ballistic arms fire, mine blasts and improvised explosive devices
(IEDs). "It's the vehicle that every crew wants when they're out in the
field," Navistar's website says. The firm declined to comment on this
report.

[Recipients of US weaponry are **legally obligated to adhere to end-use
requirements** which **prohibit the transferring of any equipment to
third parties without prior authorization** from the US government. That
authorization was never obtained.]{.underline}

The Saudi coalition did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A
senior UAE official denied "in no uncertain terms that we are in
violation of end-user agreements in any manner."

The Giants Brigade is a "part of Yemeni forces," the official told CNN,
adding that the group was under the direct supervision of the UAE and,
therefore, the equipment was in the "collective possession" of the
coalition.

[The US Department of Defense, when asked specifically about the Giants
Brigades, said it had not given Saudi Arabia or the UAE permission to
hand over US weaponry to other factions on the ground.]{.underline}

\"The United States has not authorized the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or
the United Arab Emirates to re-transfer any equipment to parties inside
Yemen,\" Pentagon spokesman Johnny Michael told CNN. \"The US government
cannot comment on any pending investigations of claims of end-use
violations of defense articles and services transferred to our allies
and partners.\"

[Iran is 'assessing US military technology closely']{.underline}

[Because a majority of American troop deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq are
caused by IEDs, it is critical that knowledge of MRAP vulnerabilities
does not fall into enemy hands.]{.underline}

[But it\'s already too late.]{.underline}

In September [2017, a Houthi]{.underline}-run TV channel broadcast
images of Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the de facto [rebel
leader]{.underline}, proudly sitting behind the wheel of a [captured
US-made MRAP]{.underline} in the capital Sanaa, as a crowd chanted
\"death to America\" in the background. CNN obtained an image showing
the serial numbers of a second American MRAP in the hands of another
senior Houthi official last year in Hodeidah. The photo was first
published by Yemeni journalist Hussain al Bukhaiti, the official's
brother.

The vehicle was part of a \$2.5 billion sale to the UAE in 2014. The
sale document, seen by CNN, certifies that \"a determination has been
made that the recipient country can provide the same degree of
protection for the sensitive technology\" as the United States.

[MRAPs]{.underline} like these, [captured on the battlefield, have been
probed by Iranian intelligence,]{.underline} according to a member of a
secret Houthi unit backed by Iran known as the Preventative Security
Force. The unit oversees the transfer of military technology to and from
Tehran.

[The member of the force, speaking to CNN anonymously out of fear for
his safety, revealed that Iranian and Hezbollah advisers have already
gotten their hands on the armored vehicles and other US military
hardware.]{.underline}

[\"Iranian intelligence are assessing US military technology very
closely,\" the source said in an audio interview done from Sanaa.
\"Listen, there isn\'t a single American weapon that they don\'t try to
find out its details, what it\'s made of, how it works.\"]{.underline}

[IEDs are now mass-produced in Yemen by Houthi forces on a scale only
previously achieved by ISIS,]{.underline} according to a report
published by Conflict Armament Research.

The group tracks weapons and their supply chains in conflict zones, and
has found IEDs containing Iranian components in Yemen.

Hizam Al Assad, a member of the Houthi Political Council, confirmed to
CNN that the MRAPs were still in Houthi hands but denied the existence
of the Preventative Security Force.

Iran has not responded to a CNN request for comment.

[Human cost of conflict]{.underline}

[The flood of US weaponry is fueling a conflict that has killed tens of
thousands]{.underline} \-- among them children on school buses and
families fleeing violence \-- and pushed millions more to the brink of
famine.

Two-year-old Rehab is so severely malnourished that her chest has
collapsed into a deep dent at the center of her tiny body.

Rehab, 2, is examined by a doctor in Tohta.

There are an estimated 200 cases of malnutrition like hers in the
village of Tohta, a frontline area surrounded by artillery and mortar
positions on the Red Sea coast near Hodeidah.

A few months ago, the local clinic was shut down due to political
disagreements over funding. But Dr. Fatma Ibrahim won't give up.

She conducts house-to-house visits every week, and as soon as she steps
into the street, worried parents flock to her.

"Look, look," one father demands as he shows the doctor his skeletal
14-month-old girl, Roula. Ibrahim gently examines her, but soon it\'s
time to move on to the next baby.

For a young man, joining a fighting faction is one of the few means of
finding employment in a poor country with little infrastructure and a
barely functioning economy.

At the same time, too many powerful political figures and key armed
actors in the region have been prospering greatly from the conflict and,
as a result, they lack the incentives to agree to a peace process that
would threaten their financial gain.

The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to both Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates, and its support is crucial to the Saudi
coalition's continuing war in Yemen.

US lawmakers are trying to pass a resolution ending the Trump
administration's support for the coalition.

On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy described CNN's
investigation as a \"bombshell\" that should serve as a wake-up call to
\"get us out of the war in Yemen that has gone horribly wrong.\"

But Gen. Joseph Votel, the top US commander in the Middle East, told a
Senate hearing that while the military would be \"looking more closely
at the allegations\" in CNN's report, withdrawing support for the Saudi
coalition could further endanger Americans in the region.

[There is scant evidence that the White House wants to divert from its
current approach, despite evidence that the actions of a key US ally may
be making Americans less safe.]{.underline}

In the wake of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi murder last year, Trump
said it would be foolish for the US to cancel multi-billion dollar arms
deals with the Saudis. \"I don\'t want to lose all of that investment
being made into our country,\" he said.

#### US stopping sale of arms to Saudi Arabia is key -- it's the number one supplier, and Saudi Arabia is getting the most advanced weapons.

Arms import trends in Saudi Arabia

Despite fluctuations[, Saudi Arabia was the second largest arms importer
in the world in the period 1998--2017. There was a]{.underline} low
point in the period 2000--2008 when the country's armed forces
integrated large volumes of weapons that were ordered in the aftermath
of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990--91 and delivered in the late
1990s. This was followed by a [steep increase in the volume of arms
imports in 2013--2017 (see figure 3), to a level higher than any
previous five-year period and substantially higher than other countries
in the Gulf region]{.underline}.

Saudi Arabia\'s import of advanced weapons

[The SIPRI arms transfers database yields a long list of arms imported
by Saudi Arabia in the period 2013--2017. As these are generally
advanced weapons, Saudi Arabia is the most well-armed country in the
Gulf region in terms of its inventory of modern equipment. Only a few
examples are necessary to illustrate the types of recently acquired
weapons that are important to Saudi Arabia's capability to wage war in
Yemen while at the same time conducting internal military operations,
maintaining a military capability at the border with Iraq, facing Iran
militarily and contemplating the possibility of deploying its military
in Syria.]{.underline}

A combination of newly procured air force assets has increased the reach
and strike power of the Saudi Arabian armed forces[. The Royal Saudi Air
Forces (RSAF) uses several types of combat aircraft, all of which have
been used in the war in Yemen.]{.underline} During the 1990s, the USA
supplied 72 F-15S. Starting in 2016, these began being replaced by 154
F-15SA, a heavily modernized version of the F-15S ordered from the USA
in 2011. In addition, [the USA continues to deliver large quantities of
ordnance for these aircraft,]{.underline} such as SLAM-ER cruise
missiles with a 280-kilometre range, and a variety of guided bombs that
have been used in Yemen.

The United Kingdom supplied Tornado combat aircraft in the 1990s, and 84
of these were upgraded in the period 2007--13 to enable them to carry
new guided weapons, such as Storm Shadow cruise missiles which have a
range of at least 250 kilometres. These and other guided weapons
delivered by the UK have been used in Yemen since 2015, and deliveries
are ongoing. The UK also delivered 72 Typhoon combat aircraft in
2009--17 and contract negotiations for 48 more were continuing in 2018.

Saudi Arabia bases its long-range strike capability on aircraft, but it
also maintains a secretive Strategic Missile Force equipped with a small
arsenal of DF-3 ballistic missiles. These have a range of at least 2500
km and were supplied by China in 1988. There are indications that this
force was modernized around 2010.

A small fleet of tanker aircraft extends the range and increases the
payload of Saudi Arabia's combat aircraft. To supplement its existing
tanker aircraft, six new A-330 MRTT built by the trans-European Airbus
consortium were delivered from Spain between 2011 and 2015. The
significance of this tanker fleet was highlighted when, in November
2018, Saudi Arabia stated that it no longer required aerial refuelling
support from the USA for its operations in Yemen 'because it could now
handle it by itself'. Nonetheless[, it remains uncertain just how
independent the country really is in this regard.]{.underline}

[Sophisticated intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and command
and control equipment is crucial to the Saudi Arabian
military.]{.underline} Five E-3 airborne early warning and control
(AEW&C) aircraft were acquired from the USA in the 1980s and are
currently being extensively upgraded. In addition, Sweden supplied two
Erieye AEW&C aircraft in 2014.

[At the same time, Saudi Arabia is improving its capability to defend
against air and missile attacks. In 2014--17 it received 21 Patriot
PAC-3 air defence systems from the USA,]{.underline} which have been
used with mixed success to defend Riyadh and other places in Saudi
Arabia against ballistic missiles fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen. [In
November 2018 Saudi Arabia signed an agreement with the USA to buy THAAD
systems, the most advanced anti-missile system available.]{.underline}

Together, the increasing reach of the RSAF combined with improved target
acquisition capabilities and evolving air and missile defence systems
widen the technological gap between the Saudi Arabian arsenal and that
of its main rival, Iran.

[Saudi Arabia's land and naval forces are also continuously being
improved. In the period 2013--17, for example, the army and National
Guard received over 3000 armoured vehicles from Austria, Canada, France,
Georgia, South Africa, Turkey and the USA. Many of the vehicle types
delivered in recent years have been highly visible in coverage of the
war in Yemen. The Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF), which play an
important role in the blockade of Yemen, has initiated several major
procurement projects in recent years,]{.underline} including orders for
at least 33 patrol boats from Germany in 2014, two large patrol boats
from France in 2015, 4 highly advanced frigates [from the
USA]{.underline} in 2017 and 5 corvettes from Spain in 2018.

One aspect of Saudi Arabian military activities remains especially
difficult to assess as reliable information is so scarce---the extent of
the support it provides to its allies in the Middle East, often in
competition with Iranian support to its allies. For example, there are
strong indications that Saudi Arabia has supplied significant amounts of
weaponry to rebel forces in Syria and to government forces or related
armed groups in Yemen. These weapons come from existing Saudi Arabian
stocks or have reportedly been procured specifically for this purpose
from Bulgaria, Croatia and Serbia, among others.

Where do Saudi Arabia\'s arms come from?

[In 2013--17, 61 per cent of Saudi Arabia's arms imports came from the
USA and 23 per cent from the UK. Several other West European countries
supplied most of the rest (see figure 4).]{.underline}

#### The US and Russia would interpret small or large scale attacks from terrorist groups as acts of nuclear war and counterattack, causing extinction

Risks of Inadvertent Nuclear War Between the United States and Russia,"
Science and Global Security 21(2): 106-133)

[War involving significant fractions of the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}, which are by far the largest of any nations,
could have **[globally catastrophic effects]{.underline}** such as
[severely reducing food production for years, potentially leading to
collapse of modern civilization worldwide]{.underline}, [and even
the]{.underline} **[extinction of humanity]{.underline}**. [Nuclear war
between the United States and Russia could occur by various
routes]{.underline}, including [accidental or unauthorized
launch]{.underline}; [deliberate first attack by one
nation]{.underline}; and [inadvertent attack]{.underline}. In an
accidental or unauthorized launch or detonation, [system safeguards or
procedures to maintain control over nuclear weapons fail in such a way
that a nuclear weapon or missile launches or explodes without direction
from leaders]{.underline}. In a deliberate first attack, the attacking
nation decides to attack based on accurate information about the state
of affairs. In an inadvertent attack, the [attacking nation mistakenly
concludes that it is under attack and launches nuclear weapons in what
it believes is a counterattack.]{.underline}

Over the years, nuclear strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks
of intentional attack through development of deterrence capabilities,
and numerous measures also were taken to reduce probabilities of
accidents, unauthorized attack, and inadvertent war. For purposes of
deterrence, both U.S. and Soviet/Russian forces have maintained
significant capabilities to have some forces survive a first attack by
the other side and to launch a subsequent counter-attack. However,
[concerns about the extreme disruptions that a first attack would cause
in the other side\'s forces and command-and-control capabilities led to
both sides' development of capabilities to detect a first attack and
launch a counter-attack before suffering damage from the first
attack.]{.underline}

Many people believe that with the end of the Cold War and with improved
relations between the United States and Russia, the risk of East-West
nuclear war was significantly reduced. However, it also has been argued
that [inadvertent nuclear war between the United States and Russia has
continued to present a substantial risk]{.underline}. While the United
States and Russia are not actively threatening each other with war, they
have remained [ready to launch nuclear missiles in response to
indications of attack.]{.underline}

False indicators of a nuclear attack could be caused in several ways.
First, a [wide range of events have already been mistakenly interpreted
as indicators of attack]{.underline}, including weather phenomena, a
faulty computer chip, wild animal activity, and control-room training
tapes loaded at the wrong time. Second, [terrorist groups or other
actors might cause attacks on either the United States or Russia that
resemble some kind of nuclear attack by the other nation by actions such
as exploding a stolen or improvised nuclear bomb, especially if such an
event occurs during a crisis between the United States and
Russia]{.underline}. **[A variety of nuclear terrorism scenarios are
possible]{.underline}**. [**Al Qaeda** has sought to obtain or construct
nuclear weapons and to use them against the United States]{.underline}.
Other methods could involve [attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon
launch control safeguards or exploit holes in their
security.]{.underline}

It has long been argued that the [probability of inadvertent nuclear war
is significantly higher]{.underline} during U.S.--Russian crisis
conditions, with the Cuban Missile Crisis being a prime historical
example. It is possible that U.S.--Russian relations will significantly
deteriorate in the future, increasing nuclear tensions. There are a
[variety of ways]{.underline} for a [third party to raise tensions
between the United States and Russia, making one or both nations more
likely to misinterpret events as attacks]{.underline}.

#### Ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia solves Yemen conflict 

**Lam 4/9**- (Sophia, UChicago Gate contributor, "Ending US Arms Sales
to Saudi Arabia," The Gate, 2019,
http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/)

[Ending US arms sales to Saudi Arabia will help **resolve the conflict
in Yemen** in two ways. First, US arms often [end up in the wrong
hands](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/),
sometimes intentionally and sometimes unintentionally.]{.underline} Nima
Elbagir of
CNN [reports](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/) that
[Saudi Arabia has been transferring American weapons to Salafi militias
and other factions to escalate the conflict.]{.underline} These groups
cannot adequately retain the weapons that they receive. For example,
[Houthi and Iranian-backed forces have also wielded US weapons in
Yemen.]{.underline} The Houthis are currently more militarily
sophisticated and better able to [strike beyond Yemen's
borders](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/yemen/2018-11-26/only-way-end-war-yemen) than
they were at the start of the war. [Ending arms sales will disarm groups
on both sides and help stop large quantities of weapons from stoking the
flames of conflict.]{.underline}

[Second, ending arms sales will ground Saudi Arabia's airstrikes. Other
than proxy groups, Saudi Arabia's
main [method](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/world/middleeast/yemen-us-saudi-civilian-war.html) to
wage war and perpetrate genocide is by deploying its US-fueled air
force. The United States
continually [refuels ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/13/is-this-turning-point-war-yemen/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fcc7a5f30dd1)the
coalition aircraft that is used to kill a large number of civilians in
coalition airstrikes; US-made munitions have been found at numerous
attack sites, ranging from hospitals to weddings. In Yemen alone, over
half of civilian deaths have been caused by [Saudi
airstrikes](https://71republic.com/2018/12/09/end-alliance-with-saudi-arabia/) that
targeted hospitals, funerals, schools and refugee camps. The Saudis
have [blockaded](https://71republic.com/2018/12/09/end-alliance-with-saudi-arabia/) food
and supplies from entering Yemen in coordination with the United States
as well.]{.underline}

[Ending arms sales
will [limit](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/10/after-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-to-the-saudis-are-essential-leverage/) Saudi
Arabia's capability to incite violence abroad and stifle civilian
populations' wellbeings. Moreover, Saudi Arabia's military technology is
maintained and upgraded by the United States with almost no assistance
from the Saudis. Shifting maintenance costs to Saudi Arabia will help
check Saudi aggression.]{.underline}

## Yemen War Extensions

### Yemen War I/L Ext.

#### Saudi campaign to seduce Trump into selling arms has worked, exacerbating the Iran proxy war and overall making things worse

Mohamad **Bazzi**, 6-11-20**18**, \"The war in Yemen is disastrous.
America is only making things worse,\" Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-yemen-saudi-arabi-war-us-involvement-worsening-crisis

[The **Saudi campaign to seduce Trump** **worked**]{.underline}. Since
then, [Trump has offered virtually **unqualified support** for Saudi
leaders]{.underline}, [especially]{.underline} the young and ambitious
crown prince [Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline}, who is the [architect of
the disastrous war in Yemen]{.underline}. [By blatantly taking sides,
**Trump exacerbated the proxy war** between Iran and Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, and inflamed sectarian conflict in the region.

During his visit to Riyadh, [Trump announced a series of weapons sales
to the kingdom]{.underline} that will total nearly \$110bn over 10
years. Trump, along with Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior
adviser, who played a major role in negotiating parts of the agreement,
were [quick to claim credit]{.underline} for a massive arms deal that
would boost the US economy. But many of the weapons that the [Saudis
plan to buy]{.underline} -- including [dozens of F-15 fighter jets,
Patriot missile-defense systems, Apache attack helicopters, hundreds of
armored vehicles and thousands of bombs and missiles]{.underline} --
were already approved by Obama.

From 2009 to 2016, the Obama administration authorized a record \$115bn
in military sales to Saudi Arabia, far more than any previous
administration. Of that total, US and Saudi officials signed formal
deals worth about \$58bn, and Washington delivered \$14bn worth of
weaponry.

#### Arms diverted to terrorists and other groups that fuel the Yemen War and additional conflicts/ US weapons are fueling the Yemen war

Rod **Austin**, 11-28-20**18**, , journalist, director of Fig Media
Group and former organised crime detective , \"Yemen: inquiry finds
Saudis diverting arms to factions loyal to their cause,\" Guardian,
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/28/arms-yemen-militia-were-supplied-by-west-find-analysts>
//EN

[An investigation into weapons being used in the war in Yemen has shown
numerous examples of arms supplied by the]{.underline} UK and the [US,
among others, ending up in the hands of militias including those linked
to al-Qaida and Isis.]{.underline}

[In an apparent abuse of trade agreements by the Saudi- and UAE-led
coalition, sophisticated armoured vehicles, rocket launchers, grenades
and rifles are among the weapons being purchased from European and US
companies and reaching local factions and groups.]{.underline}

As international concerns continue to rise over the humanitarian crisis
in Yemen, the report by journalist Mohamed Abo-Elgheit and the Arab
Reporters for Investigative Journalists (Arij) alleges that [not only
are weapons being openly passed to militias aligned to the Saudi
coalition but also to marginalised and feuding groups fighting their own
territorial battles.]{.underline}

The details, to be aired in an Arabic-language documentary, The End
User, came from analysis of thousands of broadcasts, social media and
closed internet groups, alongside intensive research to verify the
origins of weapons.

["Where we found abuse of the end user certification system, we sought
explanations from the arms companies and government who authorised the
sales to the coalition. Many simply turn a blind eye," said
Abo-Elgheit.]{.underline}

The documentary accuses the Saudi coalition, weapons suppliers and
governments of a sustained breach of "end user" certification laws
stretching back to the beginning of the conflict in 2015. In 2016 UN
Security Council issued a warning over "lax accountability" on the part
of the coalition, and expressed concern that weapons may be diverted to
the black market.

[No penalties have ever been levied for breaches]{.underline}.
Certificates are meant to provide an assurance to those selling arms, or
authorising their sale, that weapons will be used only by the buyer, and
not passed or sold on.

Abo-Elgheit and his team compiled evidence that calls into question the
credibility of such certificates signed by Saudi Arabia and UAE.

Germany became the first EU country to officially raise the issue with
Saudi Arabia, after footage revealed the Houthis in possession of G3
rifles that had been air-dropped into their region.

In the historical south-western city of Taiz, an absence of state or
security services has allowed Aqap (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula)
to step into the vacuum. In 2016, Aqap broadcast footage of a battle in
Taiz against the Houthis, in which their fighters used German MG3
machine guns.

["We spotted dozens of these guns in the possession of Yemenis in
different provinces. A resistance fighter in Taiz told us that the Saudi
army had handed them out to its allies,"]{.underline} said Abo-Elgheit.
The gun is made by Heckler & Koch, who also licence Saudi Arabia to make
G3 and G36 assault rifles.

Germany and Belgium have now refused to authorise arms export to parties
involved in the Yemen conflict, but others refute allegations of
diversion breaches, including the UK.

[A complex splintering and merging of factions has made the situation in
Yemen particularly volatile]{.underline}, said Abo-Elgheit[. "Since the
start of the war, the Saudi-backed government in Yemen has continued to
merge popular resistance forces into the army]{.underline}, including
Abu al-Abbas Brigades, which became part of the Armoured Brigade 35 in
Taiz," he said. "[By arming these groups the coalition is]{.underline}
in breach of international law, [fuelling all-round
conflict]{.underline} and human rights abuses."

Abu al-Abbas is on the terror watchlists of many countries, including
Saudi Arabia.

Brigadier General Mohamed al-Mahmoudi, former director of security in
Taiz, said, "It is strange for an entity to be classified as a terrorist
organisation, while being supported by those who classified it as such."
A Brigade spokesperson said: "Nothing has changed. The weapons and
financial support are still the same as before."

"[Data shows that between 2011 and 2014 Saudi Arabia and the UAE
purchased 2,600 Oshkosh M-ATV mine-resistant ambush-protected (Mrap)
vehicles from the US. In 2015, the Abu al-Abbas group received three
such vehicles whilst others have fallen into the hands of other Yemeni
factions or the hands of Houthis]{.underline}," Abo-Elgheit said.

#### Large arms get stolen in Saudi Arabia and the UAE

//EN

And there are [deadlier forms of weaponry]{.underline} that [have made
their way into the city. In October 2015, military forces loyal to the
government boasted on Saudi- and UAE-backed media that the Saudis had
airdropped American-made TOW anti-tank missiles on the same frontline
where AQAP had been known to operate at the time.]{.underline}

Local officials confirmed that the airdrop happened, but CNN\'s attempts
to conduct further interviews were blocked and the team was intimidated
by the local government. A local activist joked that the weapons had
probably been sold on.

Graveyard of US military hardware

[At a graveyard of discarded US-made military hardware near the
flashpoint port city of Hodeidah, it becomes clear that the Alwiyat al
Amalqa \-- the Giants Brigade, a predominantly Salafi, or
ultra-conservative Sunni, militia \-- is a favored faction.]{.underline}

[Nearly half a dozen Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles sit
side by side, most bearing stickers with the insignia of the Giants
Brigade.]{.underline}

[One even has the export label on it showing it was sent from Beaumont,
Texas to Abu Dhabi, in the UAE, before ending up in the hands of the
militia. The serial number of another MRAP reveals it was manufactured
by Navistar, the largest provider of armored vehicles for the US
military.]{.underline}

The armored all-terrain vehicles are built to withstand ballistic arms
fire, mine blasts and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). "It's the
vehicle that every crew wants when they're out in the field," Navistar's
website says. The firm declined to comment on this report.

Recipients of US weaponry are legally obligated to adhere to end-use
requirements which prohibit the transferring of any equipment to third
parties without prior authorization from the US government. That
authorization was never obtained.

The Saudi coalition did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A
senior UAE official denied "in no uncertain terms that we are in
violation of end-user agreements in any manner."

The Giants Brigade is a "part of Yemeni forces," the official told CNN,
adding that the group was under the direct supervision of the UAE and,
therefore, the equipment was in the "collective possession" of the
coalition.

The US Department of Defense, when asked specifically about the Giants
Brigades, said it had not given Saudi Arabia or the UAE permission to
hand over US weaponry to other factions on the ground.

\"The United States has not authorized the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or
the United Arab Emirates to re-transfer any equipment to parties inside
Yemen,\" Pentagon spokesman Johnny Michael told CNN. \"The US government
cannot comment on any pending investigations of claims of end-use
violations of defense articles and services transferred to our allies
and partners.\"

Iran is 'assessing US military technology closely'

Because a majority of American troop deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq are
caused by IEDs, it is critical that knowledge of MRAP vulnerabilities
does not fall into enemy hands.

But it\'s already too late.

In September 2017, a Houthi-run TV channel broadcast images of Mohammed
Ali al-Houthi, the de facto rebel leader, proudly sitting behind the
wheel of a captured US-made MRAP in the capital Sanaa, as a crowd
chanted \"death to America\" in the background.

[CNN obtained an image showing the serial numbers of a second American
MRAP in the hands of another senior Houthi official last year in
Hodeidah.]{.underline} The photo was first published by Yemeni
journalist Hussain al Bukhaiti, the official's brother.

[The vehicle was part of a \$2.5 billion sale to the UAE in
2014]{.underline}. The sale document, seen by CNN, certifies that \"a
determination has been made that the recipient country can provide the
same degree of protection for the sensitive technology\" as the United
States.

[MRAPs like these, captured on the battlefield, have been probed by
Iranian intelligence, according to a member of a secret Houthi unit
backed by Iran known as the Preventative Security Force. The unit
oversees the transfer of military technology to and from
Tehran.]{.underline}

//EN

It is crucial that the United States and other arms exporting nations
conduct additional due diligence and controls on any exports to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Earlier this month, a [CNN
investigation](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/) provided
[further evidence that U.S. military equipment has been transferred from
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to a variety of
militias, including some linked to al-Qaeda]{.underline}. Given the
additional scrutiny of U.S.-Saudi relations since the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, recent U.S. Senate and House resolutions on
arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and ongoing Saudi and Emirati tensions with
neighbor Qatar, now is the time for a full-scale review of U.S. arms
sales to the Gulf region.

There are clear rules against arms transfers to third parties. There are
also end-use monitoring requirements for U.S. arms exports, but these
checks are hardly universal. Given that at least some of the equipment
found in militia hands can be tied to U.S. arms sales, the Department of
Defense, State Department, and Commerce Department are clearly not
adequately monitoring sales. (Which U.S. agency is responsible for
end-use checks depends on the type of sale conducted.)

[The United States is the largest arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE]{.underline}, two lucrative customers of the U.S. defense industry.
Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S. arms, having purchased
\$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017. The UAE was
the [second-largest
importer](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/657588534/fact-check-how-much-does-saudi-arabia-spend-on-arms-deals-with-the-u-s) of
U.S. arms in the same time span. Since 2009, over[ \$27
billion](https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_4498bdea89b148989be12b75281be4f5.pdf) in
weapons have been offered to the UAE in thirty-two separate deals under
the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program.

These [arms sales continue, despite both countries' history of diverting
arms to favored militias]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia has been purchasing
weapons from third parties to pass on to allied governments and groups
at least since the 1970s, sometimes on behalf of the U.S. government.
[Transparency International's Government Defense Anti-Corruption Index
ranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE in its high-risk category for corruption,
with Saudi Arabia receiving a score of zero out of four (zero being the
worst) and the UAE receiving a score of one for lacking a
well-scrutinized process for arms export decisions that aligns with
international protocols.]{.underline}

**[Examples of Gulf States Diverting U.S. Arms]{.underline}**

- [1970s---Saudi Arabia financed U.S.-made hardware for the Afghan
  Mujahideen]{.underline}

- [1980s---Saudi Arabia was a conduit for U.S. weapons to Iraq and a
  financier of the Iran-Contra scandal]{.underline}

- [More recently, Saudi Arabia purchased weapons from Croatia and
  Bulgaria for Syrian anti-government rebels---and some of these weapons
  ended up in the hands of the self-proclaimed Islamic
  State]{.underline}

- [2014---Saudi Arabia financed \$2 billion in Russian arms for Egypt's
  military-backed government]{.underline}

- [The UAE has been accused of shipping weapons to Libyan General
  Khalifa Haftar in violation of UN sanctions and to various Syrian
  rebel groups.]{.underline}

The CNN investigation comes as [Congress ramps up its opposition to U.S.
support for the Saudi-led coalition.]{.underline} Former U.S. president
Barack Obama's administration only reluctantly agreed to support the
Saudi-led coalition as it went on the offense in 2015, seeing it as an
unwinnable proxy war against Iran. Obama had put restrictions on arms
sales and intelligence cooperation with the coalition in 2016, but
President Donald Trump's administration lifted those restrictions in
March 2017, just prior to Trump's overseas visit to Saudi Arabia.

Saudi human rights abuses in Yemen using [U.S.
weapons](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/09/world/yemen-airstrikes-intl/index.html),
such as the airstrike on a [school
bus](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html) in
August 2018 that killed forty children, and the murder of Khashoggi have
shocked the U.S. public and Congress. In the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress required the
departments of Defense and State to certify that the Saudi-led coalition
was doing all it could to prevent civilian casualties; the State
Department failed to provide that justification when it was due earlier
this month. In December,
the [Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/yemen-saudi-war-pompeo-mattis.html) approved
a measure to end arms shipments to Saudi Arabia, despite the Trump
administration's strong opposition to the bill. The measure did not have
enough votes to override a presidential veto, but senators have promised
to introduce an even tougher bill in 2019. Last week,
the [House](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html) also
passed a measure to end U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in
Yemen, but again without enough votes to override an expected
presidential veto.

The Trump administration continues to approve arms shipments to the
Saudi coalition[. In 2018 alone, the United States directly sold \$4.4
billion in arms to Saudi Arabia,]{.underline} and the administration
approved the latest sale of [Patriot missile
upgrades](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/saudia-arabia-us-missile-defense-boost-khashoggi.html) in
December. [Tens of billions of dollars

Saudi Arabia remain in the pipeline as well, awaiting approvals as part
of the controversial, alleged May 2017 [\$110 billion arms
deal](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/) with
Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration has shown little inclination to
loosen its close ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE despite the death of
Khashoggi or the conduct of the war in Yemen.]{.underline}

The monarchs of [Saudi Arabia and the UAE can conduct these proxy
operations and divert equipment with no oversight and almost no input
from their own citizens. Both countries are absolute monarchies, and
their legislative bodies are advisory and contain only regime-approved
members.]{.underline} Both countries also stamp out any free press and
most independent civil society. Information on defense policies,
including the war in Yemen, is kept secret by the monarchs and their
inner circles.

proliferation: Fears to increase if US sells technology to Saudi
Arabia," Middle East Eye,

[As news of attempts by US President Donald Trump's [administration to
sell nuclear technology to Saudi
Arabia](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/congress-probes-plan-trump-officials-sell-nuclear-technology-saudi-arabia)
circulated last week, experts told Middle East Eye that it may heighten
fears of nuclear weapons proliferation.]{.underline}

"Any nuclear technology could be used for legitimate civilian things
like producing electricity or making medical isotopes to treat cancer
patients, but [that same technology can give countries the ability to
make nuclear weapons,]{.underline}" said Dr Matthew Fuhrmann, a
professor and nuclear security expert at Texas A&M University.

"[You always want to think about what the possibilities might be, that a
country may try and use things that were provided for peaceful purposes
down the road towards military ends]{.underline}," he said.

On Tuesday, Congressman Elijah Cummings' House Oversight committee
[released a
report](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/Trump%20Saudi%20Nuclear%20Report%20-%202-19-2019.pdf)
citing unidentified whistleblowers saying that current and former
administration officials have potentially attempted to bypass Congress
to rush selling "highly sensitive" nuclear technology.

The House Oversight committee has begun an investigation into the
claims.

According to the report, [people within the White House have pursued
selling nuclear technology]{.underline} since the early days of the
president's administration.

The House Oversight office did not respond to calls prior to
publication, nor did the Department of Energy's nuclear security office
reply to emailed questions.

Speaking at an event hosted by the Arab Center Washington DC last week,
Robert Jordan, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President
George W Bush, Said: "If the transfer has already occurred, or is being
discussed, it's likely in violation of the Atomic Energy Act section
123."

The Atomic Energy Act, which came into law in 1954, stipulates that a US
president must obtain congressional approval of nuclear trade
agreements.

Within that law is a section known as 123, which prohibits recipient
countries from using purchased nuclear technology to develop weapons
programmes.

"To put it more simply, congressional approval is generally required
before these deals can enter into force, and without a nuclear
cooperation agreement, you can't engage in nuclear commerce with the
recipient country," said Fuhrmann.

On Saturday, US Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said the US will
require Saudi Arabia to agree to section 123.

\"We won\'t allow them to bypass 123 if they want to have civilian
nuclear power that includes US nuclear technologies,\" Brouilette told
CNBC.

Concerns of nuclear proliferation

Experts, including Fuhrmann, said that [even if Saudi Arabia pledges to
use nuclear technology for purely peaceful purposes, selling nuclear
materials to them still runs the risk of eventual
proliferation.]{.underline}

"When you think about a country like Saudi Arabia, they're operating in
a dangerous environment, already fighting proxy wars with countries like
Iran and there is a possibility of regional conflict in the future," he
told MEE.

From Saudi Arabia's standpoint, "[you look at that situation and think
that there might be strong strategic incentive to want nuclear
weapons]{.underline}", he said.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de-facto ruler, said
last March that [if Iran attempts to pursue a nuclear weapon, Saudi
Arabia will do the same.]{.underline}

#### Prolif causes multiple scenarios for nuclear war

**Kroenig 16**- (Matthew, Associate Professor in the Department of
Government and School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and a
Senior Fellow in the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security at
the Atlantic Council, "Approaching Critical Mass: Asia's Multipolar
Nuclear Future," National Bureau of Asian Research Special Report #58,
June 2016

[The most important reason to be concerned about nuclear weapons in
Asia]{.underline}, of course, [is the threat that nuclear weapons might
be used]{.underline}. To be sure, [the use of nuclear weapons remains
remote, but the probability is not zero and the consequences could be
catastrophic]{.underline}. The subject, therefore, deserves careful
scrutiny. [Nuclear use would overturn a 70-year tradition of nonuse,
could result in large-scale death and destruction, and might set a
precedent that shapes how nuclear weapons are viewed, proliferated, and
postured decades hence. The dangers of escalation may be magnified in a
multipolar nuclear order in which small skirmishes present the potential
to quickly draw in multiple powers, each with a finger on the nuclear
trigger]{.underline}. The following discussion will explore the logic of
crisis escalation and strategic stability in a multipolar nuclear
order.14¶ First and foremost, [the existence of multipolar nuclear
powers means that crises may pit multiple nuclear-armed states against
one another]{.underline}. This may be the result of formal planning if a
state's strategy calls for fighting multiple nuclear-armed adversaries
simultaneously. A state may choose such a strategy if it believes that a
war with one of these states would inevitably mean war with both.
Alternatively, in a war between state A and state B, state A may decide
to conduct a preventive strike on state C for fear that it would
otherwise seek to exploit the aftermath of the war between states A and
B. Given U.S. nuclear strategy in the early Cold War, for example, it is
likely that a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union
would have also resulted in U.S. nuclear attacks against China, even if
China had not been a direct participant in the precipitating dispute.¶
In addition, [conflicts of interest between nuclear powers may
inadvertently impinge on the interests of other nuclear-armed states,
drawing them into conflict. There is always a danger that one nuclear
power could take action against a nuclear rival and that this action
would unintentionally cross a red line for a third nuclear power,
triggering a tripartite nuclear crisis]{.underline}. Linton Brooks and
Mira Rapp-Hooper have dubbed this category of phenomena the "security
trilemma."15 For example, if the United States were to engage in a show
of force in an effort to signal resolve to Russia, such as the flushing
of nuclear submarines, this action could inadvertently trigger a crisis
for China.¶ [There is also the issue of "catalytic" war]{.underline}.
This may be the first mechanism by which Cold War strategists feared
that multiple nuclear players could increase the motivations for a
nuclear exchange. They worried that [a third nuclear power]{.underline},
such as China, [might conduct a nuclear strike on one of the
superpowers, leading the wounded superpower to conclude wrongly that the
other]{.underline} superpower [was responsible and thereby retaliate
against an innocent state presumed to be the aggressor]{.underline}.
This outcome was seen as potentially attractive to the third state as a
way of destroying the superpowers and promoting itself within the global
power hierarchy. Fortunately, this scenario never came to pass during
the Cold War. With modern intelligence, reconnaissance, and early
warning capabilities among the major powers, it is more difficult to
imagine such a scenario today, although [this risk is still conceivable
among less technologically developed states]{.underline}.¶ In addition
to acting directly against one another, [nuclear powers could be drawn
into smaller conflicts between their allies and brought face to face in
peak crises]{.underline}. International relations [theorists discuss the
concept of "chain ganging" within alliance relationships, the dangers of
which are more severe when the possibility of nuclear escalation is
present]{.underline}.16 Although this was a potential problem even in a
bipolar nuclear order, [the more nuclear weapons states present, the
greater the likelihood of multiple nuclear powers entering a crisis. A
similar logic suggests that the more fingers on the nuclear trigger, the
more likely it is that nuclear weapons will be used.]{.underline}¶
[Multipolar nuclear crises are not without historical
precedent]{.underline}.17 Several Cold War crises featured the Soviet
Union against the United States and its European nuclear-armed allies,
Britain and later France. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War involved the United
States, the Soviet Union, and a nuclear-armed Israel. The United States
has been an interested party in regional nuclear disputes, including the
Sino-Soviet border war of 1969 and several crises in the past two
decades on the Indian subcontinent. Indeed, [many of these crises stand
out as among the most dangerous of the nuclear era.]{.underline}

### [Solvency Ext. -- Yemen War]{.underline}

#### US arms embargo against Saudi Arabia is key to ending the Yemen crisis

**Caverley 2018**- (Jonathan, expert in the global arms trade and
American military aid, "Want to Punish Saudi Arabia? Cut Off Its Weapons
Supply," The New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html>,
10/12/18 //jld)

[Despite copious evidence of U.S. weapons --- including [internationally
banned cluster
munitions](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/yemen-children-among-civilians-killed-and-maimed-in-cluster-bomb-minefields/)
--- being used to carry out attacks that have violated international
humanitarian law (the laws of war) and killed and injured Yemeni
civilians, the Trump administration is unrepentant.]{.underline} It
reversed a December 2016 Obama-era decision to suspend transfers over
concerns about civilian casualties and, on a trip to Riyadh, President
Trump himself touted [a "tremendous" new multibillion-dollar arms
deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-gets-elaborate-welcome-in-saudi-arabia-embarking-on-first-foreign-trip/2017/05/20/679f2766-3d1d-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html?utm_term=.a32a995f6471)
with Saudi Arabia. Based on our detailed investigations, Amnesty
International has been calling on all countries supplying arms to
immediately halt transfers and military assistance to all parties to the
conflict for use in Yemen.

[U.S. military officials appear increasingly rattled by reports of the
deaths caused by American weapons.]{.underline} When pressed, [Defense
Secretary James Mattis told
reporters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mattis-us-assistance-to-saudi-led-coalition-fighting-in-yemen-is-is-not-unconditional/2018/08/28/bee82195-67b5-4b35-949c-e5f877724b19_story.html?utm_term=.19797855b03f)
at the Pentagon on Tuesday that U.S. support to the Saudi Arabia-led
coalition is "not unconditional."

Congress is also bringing pressure to bear. The recently signed [2019
National Defense Authorization
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5515/text)
(NDAA) orders Mattis to review whether the United States or its allies
violated human rights in Yemen, including during [interrogations of
Yemeni
detainees](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/07/disappearances-and-torture-in-southern-yemen-detention-facilities-must-be-investigated-as-war-crimes/)
captured by United Arab Emirates forces and their allies. Additionally,
it bars the U.S. military from refueling Saudi Arabian and Emirati
warplanes unless the secretary of state certifies that the coalition is
taking steps to reduce civilian casualties.

But the Trump administration has been fighting back against
congressional oversight. Trump's signing statements to the NDAA suggest
that the White House may not believe that it is bound by these
provisions. Moreover, the Trump administration may override the attempt
by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) [to
block](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-arms-yemen/u-s-lawmaker-holds-back-support-for-munitions-sale-to-gulf-allies-due-to-yemen-idUSKBN1JO2HA)
the latest sale of Raytheon precision-guided weapons to the Saudi
Arabia-led coalition.

[It is imperative that the administration reflect on how its unflinching
support to the coalition has contributed to the unlawful killing and
injuring of countless civilians, the destruction of homes, schools and
hospitals, and the creation of the [world's worst humanitarian
catastrophe.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/03/middleeast/yemen-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis-un-intl/index.html)]{.underline}

[The United States can't have it both ways. The government is rightfully
proud when [it provides items that speed humanitarian
assistance](https://ye.usembassy.gov/u-s-funded-cranes-offloading-goods-yemen/)
to Yemen, but at the same time it is providing bombs that kill children.
The one sure way to fix this is for the United States to suspend all
arms transfers to the coalition for as long as those arms are being used
to violate the laws of war in Yemen.]{.underline}

### Terrorism I/L Ext.

#### US involvement fuels ISIS and AQAP 

**Pillar 18**, Paul R. Pillar is Nonresident Senior Fellow at Georgetown
University's Center for Security Studies and served for 28 years in the
U.S. intelligence community, including as the National Intelligence
Officer for the Near East and South Asia, and deputy chief of the CIA's
Counterterrorist Center, 3-20-2018, \"The Saudi War in Yemen Is
Strengthening Terrorism,\" Just Security,
https://www.justsecurity.org/54106/saudi-war-yemen-strengthening-terrorism/

[Ending a humanitarian crisis of this scale is reason enough to ramp up
U.S. diplomatic leadership on Yemen]{.underline}. But the [country's
connection with international terrorism also demands a renewed American
push to end the war]{.underline}. It was in Yemen that al Qaeda bombed
the USS Cole in 2000, killing 17 U.S. sailors, and Yemen-based al Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has sought to blow up American
airliners, including the failed 2009 "underwear bomber" attack. More
recently, [ISIS has established a growing presence in
Yemen.]{.underline}

[U.S. airstrikes]{.underline} against terrorist targets in Yemen have
[failed to diminish the threat]{.underline}. [When AQAP's forces are
damaged, ISIS often fills the void]{.underline}. The [intense Saudi
bombardment of Yemen]{.underline} -- since March 2015 a stunning average
of one airstrike every 94 minutes [-- has neither brought Riyadh closer
to achieving its objectives nor done anything to alleviate the terrorism
problem]{.underline}. In fact, the [Houthi forces]{.underline}, who are
the principal targets of Saudi attacks, [have been among the staunchest
Yemeni opponents of the Sunni extremists in AQAP and ISIS]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, there are reports of [AQAP fighters engaged alongside
Saudi-supported Yemeni forces, combating the Houthis.]{.underline}

As we should have learned in Afghanistan and Iraq, [neither we nor Saudi
Arabia can bomb our way to victory]{.underline}. [Extremists prosper in
ungoverned spaces and amid war's misery and deprivation.]{.underline}
**[As long as the Yemen war drags on, civilians will suffer and the
terrorist threat to the United States will increase]{.underline}**. The
[collapse of government institutions amid three years of war has created
openings for AQAP and ISIS to recruit and even to control
territory.]{.underline}

The [civilian casualties from the Saudi campaign and U.S.-Saudi ties
risk creating a generation of Yemeni civilians who see the United States
as an enemy]{.underline}. In Yemen, [America's humanitarian and
counterterrorist interests align, because both require a political
resolution of the conflict]{.underline}. **[Unless the fighting stops,
the humanitarian situation will further worsen and the recruiting
ability of AQAP and ISIS will continue to increase.]{.underline}**

The Trump Administration took an important first step in December,
calling out Saudi Arabia for the humanitarian impact of its policies and
demanding an end to a Saudi blockade of Yemen's ports that prevented
essential fuel, food, and medicine from reaching civilians. Congress is
increasingly focused on whether U.S. support for the Saudi air campaign
is in America's interests, and is questioning the legality of the Saudi
blockade.

But [to save the lives of millions of Yemeni civilians and to roll back
gains made by AQAP and ISIS, President Trump needs to assert U.S.
leadership in securing an end to the conflict]{.underline}. This will
necessitate getting Saudi Arabia to accept that negotiations are the
only way to achieve the stability in Yemen that Riyadh has failed to win
on the battlefield.

Although UN-led negotiations have been stalled for over a year, the
announcement this month of a new UN envoy provides an opportunity for
diplomatic progress. A new UN Security Council resolution could set the
stage for resumed peace talks, which neighboring Oman already has
offered to host. Following repeated ceasefire calls by the White House,
the Administration should make clear to its Saudi and Emirati allies --
including during visits to Washington by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, and UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed -- that continued
airstrikes will result in the withholding of U.S. military assistance.

Otherwise, [Yemen's war will continue to threaten not only the lives of
millions of Yemenis**, but also those of Americans as
well**]{.underline}.

#### The Yemen Crisis is fueling a deadly rivalry between Al Qaeda and the Islamic State

T[he Islamic State and al-Qaeda are waging a deadly contest for
territory, recruits and influence in Yemen that is dividing tribes and
deepening instability in the Middle East's poorest nation]{.underline},
according to tribal leaders, security officials and analysts.

[Clashes are occurring regularly in central Bayda province between
Yemeni tribal forces aligned with the two extremist groups]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, an online propaganda war of videos, images and even poems is
taking place in social media forums and Internet chat rooms as both
sides seek to gain more followers and sympathizers.

[In recent weeks, the fighting has escalated. The Islamic State deployed
suicide bombers, including a Somali national, against al-Qaeda
positions, killing and injuring more than 10 fighters, including
commanders. Al-Qaeda, in retaliation, attacked Islamic State bases,
claiming to wrest six of them away.]{.underline}

[Then, a tribal group affiliated with al-Qaeda did something
unprecedented: It offered a \$20,000 reward for the apprehension or
death of the local Islamic State leader.]{.underline}

"[The rivalry between Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Yemen has developed
into a full-blown blood feud,"]{.underline} Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen
expert at Oxford University, who closely monitors the tensions, said
late last month.

## Diversion Extensions

### Diversion I/L Ext.

**Diverted weapons fund multiple terrorist groups and give them
[critical knowledge]{.underline} of weapons systems**

**Horton 17** (Michael, fellow for Arabian affairs at the Jamestown
Foundation, frequent contributor to Jane's Intelligence Review, has
written for numerous other publications including: The National
Interest, The Economist and West Point's CTC Sentinel, Jamestown
Foundation, "Yemen: A Dangerous Regional Arms Bazaar", 6/16/17,
Terrorism Monitor Volume: 15 Issue: 12, available at:
https://www.refworld.org/docid/5947bb7c4.html \[accessed 22 June 2019\])

[After the start of the Saudi intervention in Yemen]{.underline}, which
began on March 26, 2015, [AQAP went on the offensive across much of the
southern part of the country. One of the organization\'s primary
objectives was the seizure of government stores of weapons. AQAP
succeeded in seizing stockpiles of weapons]{.underline} from sites
around the port city of al-Mukalla, among other towns, and captured
weapons from fleeing Yemeni Army units.

AQAP\'s leadership has been tied into the illicit networks that traffic
everything from arms to people. These networks have ready access to
Yemen\'s long and unguarded southern coast, allowing them to move all
manner of illicit (and licit) goods in and out of Yemen.

[The weapons became a ready source of funds for AQAP. The organization
kept and stockpiled the ones it most required and sold off those it did
not.]{.underline} Unlike the Saudi- and UAE-funded militias and army
units, AQAP\'s operatives are generally well and consistently paid.
While AQAP substantially boosted its funding when it seized an estimated
\$100 million from a branch of the Yemeni Central Bank in al-Mukalla,
[weapons sales and \"taxes\" imposed on smugglers are]{.underline} also
[significant sources of income for the group (Reuters, April 8, 2016).
On top of this, AQAP uses its access to weapons, especially ATGMs and
(potentially) surface-to-air missiles, as a way to build influence with
other al-Qaeda franchises like al-Shabaab.]{.underline}

Regional Proliferation

Relative to Yemen, there are far fewer weapons available in Somalia.
This is because Somalia has often acted as a conduit for arms and
materiel to other destinations in Africa. As a consequence of this, and
the decades of its own civil conflict, weapons command far higher prices
in Somalia than in Yemen.

[Access to adequate supplies of weapons and materiel has long been a
problem for al-Shabaab]{.underline}, and in particular the organization
has only ever had limited access to more advanced weapons[. Greater
access to ATGMs, advanced night vision equipment, lightweight man
portable mortars and hand-launched drones would make al-Shabaab a far
more lethal opponent.]{.underline}

[The leadership of AQAP and al-Shabaab have exchanged top-level
operatives]{.underline}, and both organizations have learned from one
another over the past five years. [AQAP has refined and expanded its
intelligence wing, learning from al-Shabaab\'s own intelligence
organization, the Amnniyat. \[4\] It is almost certain that al-Shabaab
will in turn benefit from AQAP\'s increasing experience in operating and
deploying a wider array of weapons. It is also likely that al-Shabaab
will benefit from AQAP\'s access to these weapons.]{.underline}

Al-Shabaab will not be the only group in Somalia to benefit from the
outflow of weapons from Yemen. [Somalia\'s pirate gangs,]{.underline}
which have had a working relationship with parts of the al-Shabaab
organization, [may also gain.]{.underline}

Somalia\'s pirate gangs have been greatly weakened over the last four
years due to the efforts of the international community and by the
governments of Somalia and Somaliland. Meanwhile, many shipping
companies have taken action, hiring armed security teams for their
ships. Somalia\'s pirates have historically been poorly armed, relying
on assault rifles and RPGs. [If these gangs were to gain access to
ATGMs, which can be easily repurposed, or other advanced weapons, it
could make them far more of a threat]{.underline} to ships transiting
the Bab al-Mandeb and the Somali coast (al-Jazeera, March 15).

Outlook

Al-Shabaab and Somalia\'s pirate gangs are but two [groups that stand to
benefit from the availability of weapons in Yemen]{.underline}.
Undoubtedly, as the war continues, there [will be many more. Yemen\'s
coast is extensive and unguarded. Weapons and materiel are being
exported with ease from Yemen to Somalia. It is likely that they are
travelling even further]{.underline} afield.

Quite apart from the dangers posed by an unchecked outflow of weapons,
including some relatively advanced armaments, [the trade is a ready
source of cash for al-Qaeda\'s most capable franchise. Meanwhile, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE\'s large scale exporting of arms to Yemen will have
grave repercussions for both them and the region as a
whole.]{.underline}

While personal ownership of weapons in [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} is
highly regulated, a thriving black market for weapons exists there.
Given that Saudi Arabia has little control of its border with Yemen[, it
is likely that some of the weapons there are making their way across the
border to be re-sold in Saudi Arabia to terrorist cells and other
organizations]{.underline} that oppose the House of Saud.

[The war in Yemen and the weapons provided to its various actors have
the potential to]{.underline} reshape and [intensify]{.underline} piracy
and other [regional threats. The outflow of weapons from Yemen is itself
of great concern, but knowledge and experience of how best to use them
is also being exported. The policy of supplying]{.underline} tens, if
not hundreds, of [millions of dollars worth of weapons to]{.underline}
ad-hoc [militias in a country as unstable and strategically located as
Yemen will result in a host of unintended and deadly
consequences.]{.underline}

#### The Saudi Arabian coalition is providing a huge influx of diverse arms into Yemen 

**Horton 17** (Michael, fellow for Arabian affairs at the Jamestown
Foundation, frequent contributor to Jane's Intelligence Review, has
written for numerous other publications including: The National
Interest, The Economist and West Point's CTC Sentinel, Jamestown
Foundation, "Yemen: A Dangerous Regional Arms Bazaar", 6/16/17,
Terrorism Monitor Volume: 15 Issue: 12, available at:
https://www.refworld.org/docid/5947bb7c4.html \[accessed 22 June 2019\])

[Yemen is the second most heavily armed country in the world after the
United States.]{.underline} Before the current civil war began, there
were an estimated 54 guns for every 100 residents. \[1\] [Now, the
number of small and medium arms in the country is far higher. Both Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who are the primary external
participants in the war, have flooded Yemen with weapons of all types.
These weapons, which range from assault rifles to anti-tank guided
missiles (ATGMs), are being provided to a range of disparate
militias]{.underline} so that, in theory, they can fight the Houthis who
control northwest Yemen. In reality, [there are]{.underline} almost [no
safeguards in place to monitor the end-use of these
weapons.]{.underline} \[2\] Consequently, many of them, including
sophisticated medium arms like ATGMs, are sold on to whichever
organization or individual will pay the highest price. \[3\]

Before the start of the conflict, Yemen was already a regional arms
bazaar, [but the country\'s well-established smuggling networks have
been reinvigorated by the influx of weapons.]{.underline} These networks
have contacts throughout the region and move significant quantities of
arms to Somalia and further afield, but it is not only Yemen\'s arms
dealers who are profiting from the inflow of weapons. [Groups like
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Somalia-based al-Shabaab
are]{.underline} also [benefiting. In the case of AQAP, the group has
never been better armed or better funded. While al-Shabaab has long
suffered from a dearth of weapons and materiel, this may not be the case
for much longer. What is certain is that the consequences of
indiscriminate weapons transfers to Yemen will have a profound effect
not only on Yemen but also on the region as a whole in the months and
years to come.]{.underline}

From Submachine Guns to Gently Used Tanks

Yemen\'s arms markets are a paradise for organizations that want to
stock up on anything from the latest high-end Heckler and Koch
submachine guns to secondhand but barely used tanks. Even when Yemen had
a functioning government, it was unable, and largely unwilling, to
impede the illicit trade in weapons.

Yemen\'s largest arms market is in the village of Jihana, a mere
40-minute drive from the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. There - and at other
markets - buyers can find a dizzying array of small and medium arms[.
Heavy weapons - such as tanks, artillery pieces and armored vehicles -
are also easily procured.]{.underline}

Most civil wars create a shortage of weapons and materiel, but [Yemen\'s
conflict has resulted in a glut of arms. Prices for less desirable
assault rifles, like the Steyr AUG used by Saudi forces, have
plummeted.]{.underline} These rifles now cost less than \$60. Of far
more interest to most buyers are [the advanced weapons
systems]{.underline} that have only recently been made available. These
include ATGMs and, perhaps most worryingly, surface-to-air missiles like
the SA-7 Grail and its variants. However, it is the ATGMs that [are most
in demand by all sides in the conflict and have proved to be decisive in
various battles around Yemen.]{.underline} Most of the more advanced
weapons, like the third-generation ATGMs, have come into the country in
the last two years. In addition to weapons, advanced kit like
night-vision goggles, hand-launched drones and encrypted communication
devices are also widely available.

[There are numerous claims that Iran is providing weapons to the
Houthis. However, it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia that are providing the
vast majority of these more advanced weapons. While they may be intended
for anti-Houthi militias]{.underline} and reconstituted units of the
part of the Yemeni Army aligned with Yemen\'s government-in-exile, [the
leaders of these forces simply sell much of it on the open
market]{.underline} (Daily Star, May 1). These militias and army units
are poorly paid - if they are paid at all - and the sale of weapons
provides a source of funds for both the men and their officers.

There is a long history in Yemen of military units selling weapons and
materiel. Between 2004 and 2011, during the Houthis\' six wars with the
Yemeni government, led by then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the
rebel\'s primary source for weapons and ammunition was the Yemeni Army
they were fighting.

While recently supplied weapons are being sold by the militias and army
units, [all sides in the conflict have seized weapons during battles and
from Yemeni army stockpiles. These seized weapons, those that are deemed
to be in surplus and not readily needed, are sold to arms dealers, third
parties and, in some cases, even rivals.]{.underline}

#### US military equipment has been transferred to al-Qaeda

**Vittori 19** (Jodi, 2/19/19, Expert on the linkages of corruption,
state fragility, illicit finance, and U.S. national security, U.S.
research and policy manager for Transparency International's Defense and
Security Program, adjunct professor at Georgetown University, "American
Weapons in the Wrong Hands", Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/19/american-weapons-in-wrong-hands-pub-78408)>

Earlier this month, a CNN investigation provided further evidence that
[U.S. military equipment has been transferred from Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) to a variety of militias, including some
linked to al-Qaeda]{.underline}. Given the additional scrutiny of
U.S.-Saudi relations since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
recent U.S. Senate and House resolutions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
and ongoing Saudi and Emirati tensions with neighbor Qatar[, now is the
time for a full-scale review of U.S. arms sales to the Gulf
region.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia feeds weapons to terrorists

[CNN reported that Saudi Arabia has been giving American-made weapons to
groups linked to al Qaeda. The Saudis have been using weapon sales to
gain leverage in the ongoing war in Yemen.]{.underline}

In August, the Washington Post reported, "New Associated Press reporting
from Yemen has laid bare the fact that [the UAE and Saudi Arabia have
been busy cutting 'secret deals with al-Qaida fighters, paying some to
leave key cities and towns and letting others retreat with weapons,
equipment and wads of looted cash ... hundreds more were recruited to
join the coalition itself.'"]{.underline}

Now CNN reveals this is happening with American weapons. Why wouldn't
this happen? Anyone could have predicted it. After all, Saudi Arabia is
America's number one weapons customer.

The weapons and equipment CNN learned are in al Qaeda's possession were
sold by the U.S. during the Obama administration, though [sales continue
under President Trump.]{.underline}

//EN

It is crucial that the United States and other arms exporting nations
conduct additional due diligence and controls on any exports to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Earlier this month, a [CNN
investigation](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/) provided
[further evidence that U.S. military equipment has been transferred from
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to a variety of
militias, including some linked to al-Qaeda]{.underline}. Given the
additional scrutiny of U.S.-Saudi relations since the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, recent U.S. Senate and House resolutions on
arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and ongoing Saudi and Emirati tensions with
neighbor Qatar, now is the time for a full-scale review of U.S. arms
sales to the Gulf region.

There are clear rules against arms transfers to third parties. There are
also end-use monitoring requirements for U.S. arms exports, but these
checks are hardly universal. Given that at least some of the equipment
found in militia hands can be tied to U.S. arms sales, the Department of
Defense, State Department, and Commerce Department are clearly not
adequately monitoring sales. (Which U.S. agency is responsible for
end-use checks depends on the type of sale conducted.)

[The United States is the largest arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE]{.underline}, two lucrative customers of the U.S. defense industry.
Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S. arms, having purchased
\$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017. The UAE was
the [second-largest
importer](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/657588534/fact-check-how-much-does-saudi-arabia-spend-on-arms-deals-with-the-u-s) of
U.S. arms in the same time span. Since 2009, over[ \$27
billion](https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_4498bdea89b148989be12b75281be4f5.pdf) in
weapons have been offered to the UAE in thirty-two separate deals under
the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program.

These [arms sales continue, despite both countries' history of diverting
arms to favored militias]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia has been purchasing
weapons from third parties to pass on to allied governments and groups
at least since the 1970s, sometimes on behalf of the U.S. government.
[Transparency International's Government Defense Anti-Corruption Index
ranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE in its high-risk category for corruption,
with Saudi Arabia receiving a score of zero out of four (zero being the
worst) and the UAE receiving a score of one for lacking a
well-scrutinized process for arms export decisions that aligns with
international protocols.]{.underline}

**[Examples of Gulf States Diverting U.S. Arms]{.underline}**

- [1970s---Saudi Arabia financed U.S.-made hardware for the Afghan
  Mujahideen]{.underline}

- [1980s---Saudi Arabia was a conduit for U.S. weapons to Iraq and a
  financier of the Iran-Contra scandal]{.underline}

- [More recently, Saudi Arabia purchased weapons from Croatia and
  Bulgaria for Syrian anti-government rebels---and some of these weapons
  ended up in the hands of the self-proclaimed Islamic
  State]{.underline}

- [2014---Saudi Arabia financed \$2 billion in Russian arms for Egypt's
  military-backed government]{.underline}

- [The UAE has been accused of shipping weapons to Libyan General
  Khalifa Haftar in violation of UN sanctions and to various Syrian
  rebel groups.]{.underline}

The CNN investigation comes as [Congress ramps up its opposition to U.S.
support for the Saudi-led coalition.]{.underline} Former U.S. president
Barack Obama's administration only reluctantly agreed to support the
Saudi-led coalition as it went on the offense in 2015, seeing it as an
unwinnable proxy war against Iran. Obama had put restrictions on arms
sales and intelligence cooperation with the coalition in 2016, but
President Donald Trump's administration lifted those restrictions in
March 2017, just prior to Trump's overseas visit to Saudi Arabia.

Saudi human rights abuses in Yemen using [U.S.
weapons](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/09/world/yemen-airstrikes-intl/index.html),
such as the airstrike on a [school
bus](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html) in
August 2018 that killed forty children, and the murder of Khashoggi have
shocked the U.S. public and Congress. In the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress required the
departments of Defense and State to certify that the Saudi-led coalition
was doing all it could to prevent civilian casualties; the State
Department failed to provide that justification when it was due earlier
this month. In December,
the [Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/yemen-saudi-war-pompeo-mattis.html) approved
a measure to end arms shipments to Saudi Arabia, despite the Trump
administration's strong opposition to the bill. The measure did not have
enough votes to override a presidential veto, but senators have promised
to introduce an even tougher bill in 2019. Last week,
the [House](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html) also
passed a measure to end U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in
Yemen, but again without enough votes to override an expected
presidential veto.

The Trump administration continues to approve arms shipments to the
Saudi coalition[. In 2018 alone, the United States directly sold \$4.4
billion in arms to Saudi Arabia,]{.underline} and the administration
approved the latest sale of [Patriot missile
upgrades](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/saudia-arabia-us-missile-defense-boost-khashoggi.html) in
December. [Tens of billions of dollars
in [deals](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arms-missiledefense/saudi-arabia-inks-deal-for-lockheeds-missile-defense-system-idUSKCN1NX2YJ) with
Saudi Arabia remain in the pipeline as well, awaiting approvals as part
of the controversial, alleged May 2017 [\$110 billion arms
deal](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/) with
Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration has shown little inclination to
loosen its close ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE despite the death of
Khashoggi or the conduct of the war in Yemen.]{.underline}

The monarchs of [Saudi Arabia and the UAE can conduct these proxy
operations and divert equipment with no oversight and almost no input
from their own citizens. Both countries are absolute monarchies, and
their legislative bodies are advisory and contain only regime-approved
members.]{.underline} Both countries also stamp out any free press and
most independent civil society. Information on defense policies,
including the war in Yemen, is kept secret by the monarchs and their
inner circles.

//EN

Spleeters is a field investigator for Conflict Armament Research (CAR),
an international organization funded by the European Union that
documents [weapon]{.underline}s [trafficking in war zones]{.underline}.
He is 31 years old, with a 1980s Freddie Mercury mustache and tattoos
covering thin arms that tan quickly in the desert sun. In another
context, he'd be mistaken for a hipster barista, not an investigator who
has spent the past three years tracking down rocket-­propelled grenades
in Syria, AK-47-style rifles in Mali, and [hundreds of]{.underline}
other [weapons]{.underline} [that have found their way into war
zones,]{.underline} sometimes in violation of international arms
agreements. The work Spleeters does is typically undertaken by secretive
government offices, such as the US Defense Intelligence Agency's
Military Material Identification Division, known as Chuckwagon. But
while Chuckwagon is barely discoverable by Google, Spleeters' detailed
reports for CAR are both publicly available online and contain more
useful information than any classified intelligence I ever received when
I was commanding a bomb disposal unit for the US military in Iraq in
2006.

In that fight, guerrillas ambushed American soldiers with IEDs. The
devices I saw during my tours were largely hidden in the ground or
deployed as massive car bombs, detonated in marketplaces and schools so
that the gutters filled with blood. But the majority of those devices
were crude, held together with duct tape and goopy solder. The few
rockets and mortars the fighters possessed were old and shoddy, lacked
the correct fuzes, and often failed to detonate.

[Many of ISIS' leaders were veterans of]{.underline} that
i[nsurgency]{.underline}, but as they began [ramping up their war
against the Iraqi government]{.underline} in 2014, they knew they needed
more than IEDs and AK-47s to seize territory and create their
independent Islamic State. [A conventional war required conventional
arms---mortars, rockets, grenades---which, as an international pariah,
ISIS could not buy in sufficient quantities. Some they looted from the
Iraqi or Syrian governments,]{.underline} but when those ran out they
did something that no terrorist group has ever done before and that they
continue to do today: design their own munitions and mass-produce them
using advanced manufacturing techniques. Iraq's oil fields provided the
industrial base---tool-and-die sets, high-end saws, injection-­molding
machines---and skilled workers who knew how to quickly fashion intricate
parts to spec. Raw materials came from cannibalizing steel pipe and
melting down scrap. ISIS engineers forged new fuzes, new rockets and
launchers, and new bomblets to be dropped by drones, all assembled using
instruction plans drawn up by ISIS officials.

Since the early days of the conflict, CAR has conducted 83 site visits
in Iraq to collect weapons data, and Spleeters has participated in
nearly every investigation[. The result is a detailed database that
lists 1,832 weapons and 40,984 pieces of ammunition recovered in Iraq
and Syria. CAR describes it as "the most comprehensive ­sample of Islamic
State--captured weapons and ammunition to date."]{.underline}

### Blowback I/L

#### US arm sales leads to blowback through stolen or lost weapons

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3-13-20**18**, \"Risky
Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,\" Cato
Institute,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full>
//EN

Arms Sales Have Many Potential Negative Consequences

Though arms sales are of marginal value to national security and the
pursuit of national interests, their negative consequences are varied
and often severe. [Arms sales can spawn]{.underline} unwanted outcomes
on three levels: [blowback against the United States]{.underline} and
entanglement in conflicts; regional consequences in the buyer's
neighborhood, such as the dispersion of weapons and increased
instability; [and consequences]{.underline} for the buyer itself[, such
as]{.underline} increased levels of corruption, [human rights abuses,
and civil conflict.]{.underline}

Effects on the United States. Though the goal of arms sales is to
promote American security and U.S. interests abroad, at least two
possible outcomes can cause serious consequences for the United States.
The first of these --- [blowback --- occurs when a former ally turns
into an adversary and uses the weapons against the United
States]{.underline}. The second --- entanglement --- is a process
whereby an arms sales relationship draws the United States into a
greater level of unwanted intervention.

Blowback. The fact that the United States has sold weapons to almost
every nation on earth, combined with frequent military intervention,
means that [blowback is an inescapable outcome of U.S. arms sales
policy]{.underline}. American troops and their allies have faced
American-made weapons in almost every military engagement since the end
of the Cold War, including in Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan,
Yemen, and Syria. And even where the United States has not yet engaged
in combat, American arms sales have bolstered the military capabilities
of adversaries once counted as friendly.

Blowback can occur in at least three ways. First, a previously friendly
regime becomes unfriendly. For example, the United States sold billions
of dollars in weapons to the Shah of Iran during the 1970s in the hopes
that Iran would provide a stabilizing influence on the Middle East. The
sales included everything from fighter jets for air campaigns to
surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy
fighters.[70](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor070) After
the 1979 revolution, however, Iran used those weapons in its war with
Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in the
region. Panama, the recipient of decades of American military
assistance, as well as host to a major military base and 9,000 U.S.
troops, was a similar case. In 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega --- himself a
CIA asset for more than 20 years --- took power and threatened U.S.
citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that featured American troops facing
American
weapons.[71](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor071)

Blowback also occurs when the United States sells weapons to nations (or
transfers them to nonstate actors) that, though not allies, simply did
not register as potential adversaries at the time of the sale. The
United States, for example, sold surface-to-air missiles, towed guns,
tanks, and armored personnel carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. Few
officials would have imagined that the United States would find itself
intervening in Somalia in 1992, or that the United States and its allies
would provide billions in weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an
effort to balance against Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the
battlefield to reverse its annexation of
Kuwait.[72](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor072)

And finally, [blowback can occur when U.S. weapons are sold or stolen
from the government that bought them and wind up on the battlefield in
the hands of the adversary.]{.underline} For example, the Reagan
administration covertly provided Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who
were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s; they in turn
sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea, among others. More
recently, [the Islamic State managed to capture from the Iraqi
government a stunning number of Humvees and tanks the United States had
sold to Iraq to rebuild its military capabilities after the 2003
invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to supply three
divisions of a conventional
army]{.underline}.[73](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor073)

### AT No Terrorism Impact

#### Terrorists trying to get nukes, biological and chemical weapons 

UFA, June 19. /TASS[/.]{.underline}

[International terrorists are trying to obtain access to nuclear and
biological weapons and also toxic chemicals to use them in their
attacks]{.underline}, Russian Deputy Security Council Secretary Yuri
Kokov told the tenth international meeting of high-level delegates
overseeing security matters in Ufa.

\"A number of tendencies in the tactics of international terrorist
organizations' steps deserve special attention and analysis,\" Kokov
said. \"First of all, this concerns [the continued attempts to get
access to data about the manufacturing of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, their increased attention to issues related to the
use of pathogenic biological agents and toxic chemicals for terrorist
purposes. \"]{.underline}

[\"The increased use of modern high-tech technical means creates
additional risks as terrorists seek to quickly acquire them and use in
order to commit crimes,\"]{.underline} Kokov said. As an example, the
deputy security chief cited the attacks on Russian military facilities
in Syria carried out with the use of drones. This March, in order to
prevent such attacks, Russia's Aerospace Defense Forces destroyed a
depot belonging to the Hay\'at Tahrir al-Sham terrorist group in Syria's
Idlib, which stored combat unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

[UNIDIR Chief of Research John Borrie, the panel's moderator, opened the
discussion by describing the complex and multifaceted challenge of
preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons.]{.underline} He said the
resolution offers a unique opportunity for the international community
to strengthen its cooperation in this regard.

### Terrorism Impacts

#### Nuclear terror causes accidental US/Russia nuclear war\-\--extinction

**Barrett 13** -- PhD, Engineering and Public Policy from Carnegie
Mellon University, Director of Research, Global Catastrophic Risk
Institute, Fellow in the RAND Stanton Nuclear Security Fellows Program,
Seth Baum, PhD, Geography, Pennsylvania State University, Executive
Director, GCRI, Research Scientist at the Blue Marble Space Institute of
Science, former Visiting Scholar position at the Center for Research on
Environmental Decisions at Columbia University, and Kelly Hostetler,
Research Assistant, GCRI (6/28, Anthony, "Analyzing and Reducing the
Risks of Inadvertent Nuclear War Between the United States and Russia,"
Science and Global Security 21(2): 106-133)

[War involving significant fractions of the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals,]{.underline} which are by far [the largest of any
nations]{.underline}, [could have globally catastrophic
effects]{.underline} such as severely reducing food production for
years,1 potentially [leading to collapse of modern civilization
worldwide and even the **extinction of humanity**]{.underline}.2 Nuclear
war between the United States and Russia could occur by various routes,
including accidental or unauthorized launch; deliberate first attack by
one nation; and inadvertent attack. In an accidental or unauthorized
launch or detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain
control over nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or
missile launches or explodes without direction from leaders. In a
deliberate first attack, the attacking nation decides to attack based on
accurate information about the state of affairs. In an inadvertent
attack, the attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under
attack and launches nuclear weapons in what it believes is a
counterattack.3 (Brinkmanship strategies incorporate elements of all of
the above, in that they involve intentional manipulation of risks from
otherwise accidental or inadvertent launches.4 ) ¶ Over the years,
nuclear strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional
attack through development of deterrence capabilities, though numerous
measures were also taken to reduce probabilities of accidents,
unauthorized attack, and inadvertent war. For purposes of deterrence,
both U.S. and Soviet/Russian forces have maintained significant
capabilities to have some forces survive a first attack by the other
side and to launch a subsequent counterattack. However, concerns about
the extreme disruptions that a first attack would cause in the other
side's forces and command-and-control capabilities led to both sides'
development of capabilities to detect a first attack and launch a
counter-attack before suffering damage from the first attack.5¶ Many
people believe that with the end of the Cold War and with improved
relations between the United States and Russia, the risk of East-West
nuclear war was significantly reduced.6 However, it has also been argued
that [**inadvertent nuclear war** between the United States and Russia
has continue]{.underline}d [to present a **substantial
risk**]{.underline}.7 While the United States and Russia are not
actively threatening each other with war, they have remained ready to
launch nuclear missiles in response to indications of attack.8¶ [False
indicators of nuclear attack could be caused in several
ways]{.underline}. First, a wide range of events have already been
mistakenly interpreted as indicators of attack, including weather
phenomena, a faulty computer chip, wild animal activity, and
control-room training tapes loaded at the wrong time.9 Second,
[terrorist groups or other actors might cause attacks on either the
**U**nited **S**tates or Russia that resemble some kind of nuclear
attack by the other nation by actions such as exploding a stolen or
improvised nuclear bomb]{.underline},10 especially if such an event
occurs during a crisis between the United States and Russia.11 [A
variety of nuclear terrorism scenarios are possible]{.underline}.12 [Al
Qaeda has sought to obtain or construct nuclear weapons and to use them
against the United States]{.underline}.13 [Other methods could involve
attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon launch control safeguards or
exploit holes in their security.]{.underline}14 [It has long been argued
that the probability of inadvertent nuclear war is significantly higher
during U.S.-Russian crisis conditions]{.underline},15 with the Cuban
Missile Crisis being a prime historical example. [It is possible that
U.S.-Russian relations will significantly **deteriorate** in the future,
**increasing nuclear tensions**]{.underline}. [There are a variety of
ways for a third party to raise tensions between the United States and
Russia]{.underline}, [making one or both nations more likely to
misinterpret events as attacks]{.underline}.16

#### Detonation causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--even [without]{.underline} retaliation

**Toon 7** -- Chair of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic
Sciences at CU-Boulder, et al. Owen B., April 19, 2007, "Atmospheric
Effects and Societal Consequences of Regional Scale Nuclear Conflicts
and Acts of Individual Nuclear Terrorism," online:
<http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf>

To an increasing extent, [people are congregating in the world's great
urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million
individuals]{.underline}. At the same time, [advanced technology has
designed nuclear explosives of such small size they can be easily
transported in a car]{.underline}, small plane or boat [to the heart of
a city]{.underline}. We demonstrate here that [a single detonation in
the 15 kiloton range can produce urban fatalities approaching one
million]{.underline} in some cases, [and casualties exceeding one
million]{.underline}. Thousands of small weapons still exist in the
arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and there are at least six other
countries with substantial nuclear weapons inventories. In all,
thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts of highly enriched
uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives. A conflict between
any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with yields of 15 kt has
the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of the Second World
War. Moreover, [even a single surface nuclear explosion]{.underline}, or
an air burst in rainy conditions, [in a city center is likely to cause
the entire metropolitan area to be abandoned at least for
decades]{.underline} owing to infrastructure damage and radioactive
contamination. As the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in Louisiana
suggests, [the economic consequences of even a localized nuclear
catastrophe would most likely have severe national and international
economic consequences]{.underline}. Striking effects result even from
relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most
effective against city centers where business and social activity as
well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and [terrorists would
be most likely to strike there]{.underline}. Accordingly,
[an]{.underline} organized [attack on the U.S. by a small nuclear state,
or terrorists]{.underline} supported by such a state, [could generate
casualties comparable to those]{.underline} once [predicted for a
**full-scale nuclear "counterforce" exchange in a superpower
conflict**]{.underline}. Remarkably, the [estimated quantities of smoke
generated by attacks totaling about one megaton of nuclear explosives
could lead to significant global climate perturbations]{.underline}
(Robock et al., 2007). While we did not extend our casualty and damage
predictions to include potential medical, social or economic impacts
following the initial explosions, such analyses have been performed in
the past for large-scale nuclear war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson,
1985). Such a study should be carried out as well for the present
scenarios and physical outcomes.

#### Global nuclear war 

**Ayson 10** (Robert, professor of strategic studies and director of the
Centre for Strategic Studies, "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack:
Envisaging Catalytic Effects," June 21,
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1057610X.2010.483756>)

[A **Catalytic Response**: **Dragging in the Major Nuclear
Powers**]{.underline} A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of
nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place,
would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds
imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether [nuclear
terrorism should]{.underline} ever [be regarded as]{.underline}
belonging in the category of truly **[existential
threats]{.underline}**. A contrast can be drawn here with the global
catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two
or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in
significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first
century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside
considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the
Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major
nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear
weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly
awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state
possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor
nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not
necessarily separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist
attack, and especially an act of [nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a
**chain of events** leading to a **massive exchange of nuclear weapons**
between two or more of the states that possess them]{.underline}. In
this context, today\'s and tomorrow\'s terrorist groups might assume the
place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors
of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a
catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties.
These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as
concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It
may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially
plausible situation where an act [of nuclear terrorism could lead
to]{.underline} such [a **massive inter-state nuclear
war**]{.underline}. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear
attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how [Russia
and/or China could]{.underline} plausibly [be brought into the
picture]{.underline}, not least because they seem unlikely to be
fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist
groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting
that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them
as well. [Some possibilities]{.underline}, however remote, do [suggest
themselves]{.underline}. For example, [how might the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [react if
it]{.underline} was [thought]{.underline} or discovered that the
[fissile material]{.underline} used in the act of nuclear terrorism [had
come from Russian stocks]{.underline}, 40 and if for some reason Moscow

attribution** of]{.underline} that [nuclear material to a]{.underline}
particular [country might not be a case of science fiction]{.underline}
given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris
resulting from a nuclear explosion would be "spread over a wide area in
tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and
collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its

important ... some indication of where the nuclear material came from."

came as a]{.underline} complete [surprise]{.underline}, and American
officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully
responsible (or responsible at all) [suspicion would shift immediately
to state possessors]{.underline}. Ruling out Western ally countries like
the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well,
authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list
consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and
possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be
definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In
particular, if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop
of existing tension in Washington\'s relations with Russia and/or China,
and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major
powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume
the worst? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to
increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of
limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were
confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as
these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well
apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China
during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the
United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might
rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible
perpetrator or encourager of the attack? [Washington\'s]{.underline}
early [response]{.underline} to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own
soil [might]{.underline} also [raise the possibility of a]{.underline}n
unwanted (and [**nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or
China**. For example, in the]{.underline} noise and
[confusion]{.underline} during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist
nuclear attack, [the U.S.]{.underline} president [might]{.underline} be
expected to [place the]{.underline} country\'s armed forces, including
its [nuclear arsenal, on]{.underline} a [higher]{.underline} stage of
[alert]{.underline}. In such a tense environment, when careful planning
runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that
[Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S.

against them]{.underline}. In that situation, the [temptations to

["The associated rise in security costs and loss in productivity of the
workforce---through damages to labor and capital---are likely to reduce
national income]{.underline}," the authors wrote.

However, the transnational incidents, though smaller in number, involved
foreign citizens and received international media attention. ["Such
publicity makes foreign nations less willing to do business with a
terrorism-prone nation, leading to less trade and FDI]{.underline},"
they wrote.

One study the authors cited found that terrorism had no significant
impact on economic growth for developed countries, but [it did hurt
developing countries]{.underline}. The 2009 paper found that an
additional [transnational incident per million people reduced the
affected developing country's growth rate]{.underline} by around 1.4
percentage points.1

Bandyopadhyay and Younas also saw [a link between terrorism and a
developing country's ability to attract foreign investment.]{.underline}

"Greater terrorism in a developing nation [raises the risk for foreign
investors of not being able to get the returns to their investments in
the fut]{.underline}ure. Such investors will look for safer alternate
nations to invest in," they wrote.

Bandyopadhyay and Younas co-authored a 2014 paper with Todd Sandler that
examined terrorism's impact on foreign investment.2 [They found that a
one standard deviation increase in domestic terrorist incidents per
100,000 people reduced net FDI by between \$323.6 million and \$512.9
million for the average sample country]{.underline}, while the
comparable reduction in the case of transnational terrorist incidents
was between \$296.5 million and \$735.7 million.

[The three authors also found that foreign aid can substantially lessen
terrorism's impact on FDI due to greater aid flows.]{.underline}

Terrorism also [raises the costs of doing business with terror-affected
countries. This increases the prices of products, which in turn tends to
reduce the exports and imports of these nations]{.underline}.

[One study cited by the authors found that a doubling in the number of
terror incidents]{.underline} from 1960 to 1993 [was associated with a
decrease in bilateral trade among 200 countries]{.underline} by about 4
percent.3

If you happened to be an Afghan, Iraqi, Libyan, Syrian, Somali, or
Yemeni in the twenty-first century, can there be any question that life
would have seemed asteroidal to you? What Osama bin Laden began with
just 19 fanatic followers and four hijacked commercial airliners the US
military continued across the Greater Middle East and North Africa as if
it were the force from outer space (which, in a sense, it was). It
doesn't matter whether you're talking about cities turned to rubble,
civilians slaughtered, wedding parties obliterated, populations uprooted
and sent into various forms of exile, [the transformation of former
nations (however autocratic) into failed states, or the spread of
terrorism.]{.underline} It's been quite a story. More than 17 years and
at least \$5.6 trillion after the Bush administration launched its
Global War on Terror, can there be any question that the wildest dreams
of Osama bin Laden have been more than fulfilled? And it's not faintly
over yet.

More remarkable still, just [about all of this has largely been ignored
in the country that functionally made it so. If you asked most
Americans, they would certainly know that almost 3,000 civilians were
slaughtered in the terror attacks of 9/11,]{.underline} but how many (if
any) would be aware of the several hundred civilians---brides, grooms,
revelers, you name it---[similarly slaughtered in what were, in essence,
US terror attacks against multiple wedding parties in Afghanistan, Iraq,
and Yemen? And that's just to begin to mention the kinds of destruction
that have gone on largely unnoticed here.]{.underline}

In the first 18 years of this century, [tens of millions of people have
been uprooted and displaced---more than 13 million in Syria alone---from
what had been their homes]{.underline}, lives, and worlds. Many of them
were sent fleeing into countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey.
Sooner or later, more than one million Syrians made it to Europe and
21,000 even made it to the United States. [In the process, Washington's
wars (and the conflicts that unfolded from them]{.underline}) unsettled
ever more of the planet in much the way those particulates in the
atmosphere did the world of 66 million years ago. So consider it an
irony that, here in the US, so few connections have been made between
such events and an unceasing series of American conflicts across the
Greater Middle East and Africa---or that the thought of even the mildest
sorts of retreats from any of those battlegrounds instantly leaves
political and national security elites in Washington (and the media that
cover them) in an uproar of horror.

#### Terrorism leads to Extinction

(Robert,"After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic
Effects," Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July
2010, accessed 6/23/19, GDS -- EW)

[A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in
response by the country attacked in the first place, would not
necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds
imaginable.]{.underline} Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether
nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category
of [truly existential threats]{.underline}. A contrast can be drawn here
with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear
exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these
weapons in significant numbers. Even the [worst terrorism that the
twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance
alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have
wrought in the Cold War period.]{.underline} And it must be admitted
that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even
thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the
possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated
entirely by state possessors themselves.

But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor nuclear attack and a
catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and
especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of
events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or
more of the states that possess them. [In this context, today's and
tomorrow's terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the
early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals
who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between
the superpowers started by third parties]{.underline}. These risks were
considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about
nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem.

It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an
especially plausible situation where an act [of nuclear terrorism could
lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war]{.underline}. For
example[, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United
States]{.underline}, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or
China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because
they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or
encouragers of terrorist groups[. They would seem far too responsible to
be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could
just as easily threaten them as well.]{.underline}

Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example,
how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that
the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from
Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any
responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that
nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science
fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the
debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be "spread over a wide
area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable,
identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be
obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the
materials used and, most important ... some indication of where the
nuclear material came from."41

Alternatively, if the act [of nuclear terrorism came as a complete
surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist
group was fully responsible (or responsible at all) suspicion would
shift immediately to state possessors]{.underline}. Ruling out Western
ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel
and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very
short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program
continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and
China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear

While most Al-Qaeda offshoots have died out or reduced their presence,
[the AQAP branch has remained intact by taking advantage of Yemen's
instability while continuing to make threats against Saudi Arabia and
the West.]{.underline}

[Today, a large proportion of U.S. security experts believe that AQAP is
the largest terrorist threat to the United States---more so than the
Islamic State,]{.underline} the strength of which is consistently
sensationalized by the media. Experts believe [AQAP is capable of
building bombs without metal, making them easy to transfer across
international borders and nearly impossible to detect.]{.underline}

As the Saudi Arabian-led coalition---backed U.S. weapons, equipment, and
intelligence---fights Iranian-backed Houthi forces in the northern
Yemen, it is also combating AQAP militants in the country's south.

## Case Answers -- General

### AT: Saudi Build Own

#### Saudi Arabia doesn't have the capabilities to build a domestic arms industry 

**Wezeman 18** (Pieter D., Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms
Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme, 12/14/18, "Saudi Arabia,
armaments and conflict in the Middle East", SIPRI,
<https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2018/saudi-arabia-armaments-and-conflict-middle-east)>

[Given its overall investment in the military, Saudi Arabia's attempts
to build an indigenous arms industry have yielded limited results. A
government plan to reorganize and diversify the economy, launched in
2017 and known as Vision 2030]{.underline}, contains vague ambitions for
the development of an arms industry. The aim is to 'localize over 50 per
cent of \[Saudi\] military equipment spending by 2030', up from 2 per
cent in 2017. A new company has been created, Saudi Arabian Military
Industries (SAMI), by consolidating several existing companies. SAMI
aims to 'assume a leading role in the global military industry sector by
2030'. [Given the challenges that Saudi Arabia faces in developing its
industrial base more generally, and the difficulties other countries
have faced when pursuing military industrialization, the extent to which
these goals can be achieved within a 14-year period is highly
questionable. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia remains highly dependent on
arms imports, and the developing indigenous Saudi arms industry can be
expected to be based on imported technology and expertise for many years
to come.]{.underline}

### AT: UK Alt Cause

London, United Kingdom - [Campaigners hailed an \"historic\" ruling by
the United Kingdom\'s court of appeal declaring British arms sales to
Saudi Arabia for use in its war against Yemen unlawful as a potential
turning point in the conflict]{.underline}.

The decision in London on Thursday follows a challenge by the Campaign
Against Arms Trade (CAAT) that accused the UK government of licensing
arms sales despite a clear risk their use could breach international
humanitarian law.

[Although it will not halt the Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline} - in
which an estimated 100,000 people have died since 2016 - [it adds
enormous support to international efforts to end the
conflict.]{.underline}

\"This ruling is huge,\" said Sam Perlo-Freeman, a research coordinator
at CAAT.

[\"We can see that arms sales for use in Yemen are now being
challenged]{.underline} internationally - in the US and Europe - [but
this from a court in one of Saudi Arabia\'s top two arms suppliers takes
that to a whole new level.]{.underline}

[\"It is historic in terms of the government\'s approach to export
licences being found to be illegal and adds huge momentum to the
campaign both in this country and internationally for a halt to arms
sales to Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led coalition.\"]{.underline}

be able to access if they decided to purchase more equipment from Russia
or China. And while the Saudis could technically decrease crude oil
production and raise gas prices at the pump for American consumers in
retaliation to U.S. pressure, such a move would be unsustainable for the
Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has yet to diversify its economy away from energy
and its budget is financed through the sale of oil. Saudi Arabia simply
can't afford to lose market share over the long-term.]{.underline}

Fox News Sunday, \"The Saudis need us \[the U.S.\] much more than we

The White House has a number of options at its disposal to reprimand the
Saudis for the murder of a journalist.

It could do what Sen. Dick Durban
(D-Ill.) [recommended](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/democratic-sen-durbin-calls-expulsion-saudi-ambassador-n922536) and
officially expel the Saudi ambassador back to the Kingdom, but this move
would be tantamount to a symbolic expression of anger.

The administration could utilize the Magnitsky Act or issue a standalone
executive order in which sanctions are placed on Saudi officials it
believes are involved in Khashoggi's murder. The White House could also
enact U.S. travel restrictions on senior Saudi royals or ministers. 

But while these measures would be satisfying on an emotional level, it
is an open question whether a few blocked bank accounts or VISA
limitations would force Riyadh to engage in the comprehensive
retrospection that is ultimately required; according to an
analysis [conducted](https://piie.com/summary-economic-sanctions-episodes-1914-2006) by
the Peterson Institute for International Economics, sanctions are hardly
a foolproof policy response in terms of effectiveness.

[If the administration wishes to get Saudi Arabia's attention, President
Trump could take a page out of Chancellor Angela Merkel's playbook
and [indefinitely end arms

the Kingdom.]{.underline}

In fact, the president can go further than that by calling King Salman
and Crown Prince MbS and telling both that the U.S. will no longer be
providing military or intelligence assistance to the Saudi-led coalition
in Yemen, a conflict which has decimated the country's infrastructure
and contributed to what U.N. officials have long described as the
world's [most acute humanitarian
emergency](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/16/enormity-yemen-famine-initially-underestimated).

[Withdrawing the U.S. from Yemen\'s proxy war would kill two birds with
one stone---it would lift some of the stain on America's reputation by
disassociating from the war crimes that have been committed since Riyadh
entered the conflict more than three years, and it allow the U.S. to
leave a sectarian quandary that has no bearing whatsoever on U.S.
national security. Such a decision would also be a victory for the
American people, whose taxpayer dollars are being used to pay for a war
that their elected representatives in Congress have never voted on.
 ]{.underline}

[In sum, a U.S. departure would be a highly rewarding and relatively
cost-free response.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia is not the strategic ally the Kingdom's lobbyists claim it
is. At the very best, the Saudi government is no better or worse than
the rest of Arab world\'s governments.

The Khashoggi affair and Riyadh's floundering cover up of the murder
demonstrates why putting all of America's chips in the Saudi pot is
dangerous. While the U.S. should always look for opportunities to engage
the Saudis on mutual problems, [Washington should no longer confuse
Saudi Arabia's interests with its own.]{.underline}

#### Ending Saudi arms sales is necessary and sufficient to stabilize Yemen and enhance US soft power in the Middle East

[The United States should end its current level of military
involvement]{.underline} and [instead focus on humanitarian efforts and
stabilizing Yemen]{.underline}. Yemen's civil war has led to immense
destruction and instability in what is essentially a Shia and Sunni
proxy war. Additionally, the **[United States should limit its role in
this conflict by suspending current and future arms sales]{.underline}**
and instead, increase its humanitarian presence. It is [time to
re-evaluate what role the United States will play, since its current
strategy in Yemen and the Middle East is not working.]{.underline}

In [2016 the United States canceled a million-dollar weapons sale to
Saudi Arabia]{.underline} as a result of a Saudi-led coalition airstrike
on a funeral that killed over a hundred Yemeni civilians. Even though
the United States had already sold Saudi Arabia millions of dollars'
worth of weapons by that point, [the canceled sale demonstrated
consequences for the Saudis' complete disregard of civilian casualties.
It also showed that a country's ability to pay for weapons was not the
only factor the United States would consider when selling
arms.]{.underline}

[The United States should **continue suspending current arms sales and
abandon any promise of future arms sales** to Saudi Arabia while this
proxy war in Yemen continues]{.underline}. The United States should
consider foreign arms sales on a case by case basis, instead of offering
a "blank check" to a government without considering their foreign policy
and human rights record.

U.S. supporters of arms deals with Saudi Arabia argue that the revenue
generated from these sales are too beneficial to end. However, [the arms
sales and continued conflict create larger and farther-reaching
costs.]{.underline} The U.S. government should [redirect its involvement
towards humanitarian actions in Yemen. **This policy would help to

region.**]{.underline}

in Yemen, a conflict which has decimated the country's infrastructure
and contributed to what U.N. officials have long described as the
world's [most acute humanitarian
emergency](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/16/enormity-yemen-famine-initially-underestimated).

[Withdrawing the U.S. from Yemen\'s proxy war would kill two birds with
one stone---it would lift some of the stain on America's reputation by
disassociating from the war crimes that have been committed since Riyadh
entered the conflict more than three years, and it allow the U.S. to
leave a sectarian quandary that has no bearing whatsoever on U.S.
national security. Such a decision would also be a victory for the
American people, whose taxpayer dollars are being used to pay for a war
that their elected representatives in Congress have never voted on.
 ]{.underline}

[In sum, a U.S. departure would be a highly rewarding and relatively
cost-free response.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia is not the strategic ally the Kingdom's lobbyists claim it
is. At the very best, the Saudi government is no better or worse than
the rest of Arab world\'s governments.

The Khashoggi affair and Riyadh's floundering cover up of the murder
demonstrates why putting all of America's chips in the Saudi pot is
dangerous. While the U.S. should always look for opportunities to engage
the Saudis on mutual problems, [Washington should no longer confuse
Saudi Arabia's interests with its own.]{.underline}

####  US soft power key to Middle East stability---instability leads to Russia and Iran power vacuum

**Mansour 2/11**- **(Muhammad, Egyptian expert and Op-ed writer with a
specialty in Middle Eastern affairs, "U.S. Withdrawal, Arab NATO, and
How America Can be a "Force for Good," The Washington Institute,
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/u.s.-withdrawal-arab-nato-and-how-america-can-be-a-force-for-good1>,
2/11/19//JD)**

Indeed, Pompeo appears to promise an American vision for the Middle East
founded on involvement, stating that in the past decade, "[We learned
that when America retreats, chaos often follows. When we neglect our
friends, resentment builds]{.underline}." [It is difficult to square
these promises with the vacuum that will be left by the United States in
Syria, which many see as majorly beneficial to Russia and Iran rather
than American allies.]{.underline}

Ironically, the major policy shift behind Pompeo's speech---President
Trump's decision to remove American forces from Syria---actually reads
as an echo of Obama's attempts to reduce U.S. military involvement in
Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, the recent breakthrough in negotiations
between the United States and the Taliban only solidifies this image of
a continuing policy of military withdrawal.

Thus, as regional observers attempt to square Pompeo's vision with the
United States' on-the-ground actions, many are trying to identify
unspoken motives behind the administration's apparent policy
contradiction. For example, given Trump's widely recognized and
self-promoted identity as a businessman, rumors have emerged that a U.S.
withdrawal of forces has an intentionally destabilizing effect actually
intended to give momentum to the conflict in the Middle East. Increased
instability would provide President Trump with an excuse to increase
military support to U.S. allies; this in turn would prompt new of arms
deals between the Gulf and the United States, thus benefiting the U.S.
economy.

A more coherent explanation is that a military withdrawal may be
intentionally designed to push U.S. regional allies into a role long
advocated by Trump: forcing through necessity the launch of the Arab
Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA), also known as the \'Arab NATO.\'
This organization would presumably be led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia to
combat Iran and its expansionist strategy in the region.

This alliance has been a talking point of the U.S. State Department for
months: in July, the U.S. National Security Council
spokesperson [defined ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-gulf-alliance/trump-seeks-to-revive-arab-nato-to-confront-iran-idUSKBN1KH2IK)the
Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) as "[a bulwark against Iranian
aggression, terrorism, \[and\] extremism" designed to promote regional
stability]{.underline}, while in September Pompeo met with his Arab
counterparts in New York to encourage such a move. Nonetheless, despite
Washington's willingness to sponsor this alliance, divisions and policy
conflicts in the region have reduced the likelihood of such an alliance
coming to fruition. [The United States may be attempting to jumpstart a
regional alliance by sending the message that its allies cannot rely on
indefinite U.S. military involvement in the region]{.underline}. Ironic

## Add-Ons

### Iran Add-On

#### Military support for Saudi Arabia increases Iran tensions 

**Depetris 19** (Daniel R., The American Conservative, 5/28/29, "Trump's
Decision to Arm the Saudis Against Iran Will End in Disaster",
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/trumps-decision-to-arm-the-saudis-against-iran-will-end-in-disaster/)

One envisions [National Security Advisor]{.underline} John Bolton and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [whispering in Trump's ear]{.underline}
as he sits behind the big desk in the Oval [that]{.underline} [sending
more weapons to Riyadh will deliver a message of resolve]{.underline} (a
favorite Beltway buzzword[) to the Iranians]{.underline}.

[But there aren't enough adjectives in Webster's dictionary to describe
just how counterproductive, and, well, plain dumb this would
be.]{.underline}

First, such a decision would [demonstrate total and complete contempt
for a bipartisan majority in both houses of Congress that just two
months ago voted to pull U.S. military support for the Saudi-led
coalition in Yemen]{.underline}. President Trump went on to veto the
resolution shortly thereafter, rendering the effort moot. Yet the fact
that the measure passed was a [clear-cut expression of congressional
intent]{.underline}---the first time in history that the 1973 War Powers
Act was used successfully in an attempt to withdraw the United States
from an overseas conflict that wasn't authorized by Congress. [Trump
would be spitting in the face of the legislative branch were he to
continue this aggressive stance towards Iran.]{.underline}

Trump, of course, has shown that he doesn't particularly care much about
Congress's concerns. But presumably, he does care about getting the
United States out of the Middle East's proxy conflicts and
sectarianism-infected rivalries. This is one of the main reasons [more
weapons to the Saudis is such a colossal mistake. By tying Washington to
the Kingdom so closely, it reinforces a narrative already prevalent
among the Gulf monarchies that Trump is a man who can not only be bought
but used.]{.underline}

[The fact that Washington is selling these weapons to Riyadh rather than
giving them away doesn't make this ordeal any less
pathetic]{.underline}. The president may not grasp the connection, but
[by opening up America's arsenal to the Saudis, he is indirectly
**deepening America's role as a combatant in a Saudi-Iranian rivalry**
that has torn the Middle East apart and done next to nothing to make the
American people safer.]{.underline} [At a time when the United States
should be rebalancing its force posture and taking a hard look at where
and how it allocates its limited military resources]{.underline}, [Trump
is bringing us **deeper into a region of diminishing geopolitical
importance.**]{.underline}

Finally, [we need to evaluate this latest arms sale through the prism of
today's events. American-Iranian relations are in the pits. Direct
communication between the two nations is likely nonexistent. Washington
is passing messages and warnings to Tehran]{.underline} through
intermediaries like the Iraqis, Omanis, and Swiss. And the [Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps]{.underline} remains on high alert status,
[monitoring moves by U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf that could be
construed as aggressive or preparations for an attack.]{.underline}

[Trump has talked rightly about war being the last thing he wants and
has broached the idea of a bilateral negotiation with Tehran on issues
of concern. Establishing more communication nodes with the Iranians is
the correct approach.]{.underline}

[More weapons in the hands of the Saudis, however, sends Iran the
opposite message---that the United States is only interested in talking
if the topic is full surrender]{.underline}. And if Iran remains
resistant to the idea, Washington will sell munitions to its adversaries
until it's ready to sign off like the Japanese in 1945.

It should go without saying [that this is not something the Iranians
will respond kindly to.]{.underline} The administration is confident
that maximum pressure will eventually frighten Iran to the table where
it will give up everything. More likely is the opposite---[the Iranians
will stiffen their spines.]{.underline}

[It's not too late for President Trump to reverse a potentially
calamitous decision.]{.underline} For the good of America's security,
one hopes he has second thoughts and recognizes that the [U.S. and Saudi
Arabia don't always align.]{.underline}

#### Even if we won, an Iran war would be catastrophic\--terrorism, disruption of oil and gas trade, global economic decline, and a collapse of the American military

David **French**, 5-16-20**19**, \"The Many Downsides of War with
Iran,\" National Review,
https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/the-many-downsides-of-war-with-iran/

Put simply, [Iran has at least some ability to recreate the threat
environment]{.underline} faced by American troops [during the Iraq War
and to directly strike American troops and ships with a missile force
**far superior to any wartime adversary the United States has faced** in
modern times.]{.underline} Moreover, [Iranian forces can threaten and
even sink American surface vessels]{.underline}. In a notorious 2002 war
game, a hostile force simulating Iran (commanded by Marine lieutenant
general Paul Van Riper) overwhelmed the Navy and sank multiple ships ---
an outcome that would represent a [monumental disaster for the United
States]{.underline}.

Moreover, [Iran is the most sophisticated terrorist state in the
world]{.underline}. It has proven --- for decades --- that **[its
proxies can inflict serious harm on U.S. forces]{.underline}**. The
Marine-barracks bombing in 1983 killed 241 American military personnel,
more men than died in any month in either the Iraq or Afghan wars. The
1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia killed 19 American
servicemen. These casualties don't include the hundreds of Americans who
died at the hands of Iranian militias, militias that often wielded
Iranian weapons, during the Iraq War.

Finally, it's worth pondering [the economic effect of a raging conflict
in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}. According to Navy analysis, [34
percent of global crude-oil exports]{.underline} pass through the Strait
of Hormuz, along with [33 percent of the global liquid-natural-gas
market]{.underline}. **[Disruption of the oil-and-gas trade alone would
cause global (and American) economic shocks.]{.underline}**

None of this means that America should be afraid of Iran. But [no
American should be under any illusion that a real fight with Iran would
be like anything we've seen since 9/11]{.underline}. It would be
virtually nothing like the conflict in Libya or the current fight
against ISIS --- where the prime risk of casualties has been borne by
local allies. While there is some best-case chance of a limited conflict
conducted not unlike Operation Praying Mantis, it is [entirely possible
that conflict could lead to the sight of burning American ships in the
Persian Gulf, missile strikes against American bases, a significant
terror strike outside the Middle East, and an economic shock that
disrupts the American recovery.]{.underline}

Of course we would deal greater damage to Iran than they would to us. Of
course we'd (over time) get the best of any military exchange. But it's
easy to imagine a [shocked American public looking at the loss of life,
the loss of material, and the economic disruption and wondering, "When
did we agree to this?"]{.underline}

#### An Iranian war would be unsuccessful, catastrophic, and result in nuclear proliferation and global economic shocks

**National Interest**, **6-14**-2019, \"A U.S.-Iran War Would Be All
Sorts of Awful,\" National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-iran-war-would-be-all-sorts-awful-62537

[The reality is that if negotiations with Iran fail, the wreckage will
leave the United States without any good options.]{.underline} "If we
undermine negotiations now, we'll have only [two choices]{.underline}
--- Accept the reality of an [Iranian nuclear bomb, or use military
force to attack Iran's nuclear program]{.underline}," former Sen. Carl
Levin wrote in a recent op-ed for U.S. News & World Report.

There is [hardly a nation in the world that wants a nuclear
Iran]{.underline}. But the United States should only consider a [war
with Iran to be a last resort]{.underline}. "If you think the war in
Iraq was hard, **[an attack on Iran would,]{.underline}** in my
opinion**[, be a catastrophe]{.underline}**," former Defense Secretary
Robert Gates said in 2012.

Furthermore, he added that such a quixotic attack would only "**[make a
nuclear-armed Iran inevitable]{.underline}**, \[as\] [they would just
bury the program deeper and make it more covert."]{.underline}

Yet the reality of this no-win scenario has done little to deter hawks,
both in and out of Congress, from continued attempts to undermine
negotiations. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton's letter, signed by 46 of his
Republican colleagues, is only the most recent example of their
continued campaign of political brinkmanship.

[Even more worrisome though, is the cavalier attitude toward the use of
U.S. military force that underlies this approach.]{.underline}

In his recent op-ed for The New York Times, former Bush administration
official John Bolton backed up the idea of using U.S. military force
against Iran.

"The inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel's 1981
attack on Saddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007
destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can
accomplish what is required," he wrote.

"Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed," Bolton added.
"Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for
Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran."

These comments echo Cotton's statements from earlier this month. "Israel
struck Iraq's nuclear program in 1981 and they didn't reconstitute it,"
Cotton said."Rogue regimes have a way of getting the picture when there
is a credible threat of military force on the table."

[Both Bolton and Cotton's accounts of the strikes on Iraq in 1981 are
completely wrong]{.underline}.

Those [strikes actually drove the program underground, where it
expanded]{.underline}. This is [just what]{.underline} Gates warns
[would happen with Iran]{.underline}. As Deputy National Security
Advisor Colin Kahl wrote in 2012, "[new evidence suggests that Hussein
had not decided to launch a full-fledged weapons program prior to the
Israeli strike]{.underline}."

"By demonstrating Iraq's vulnerability, the attack on Osirak actually
increased Hussein's determination to develop a nuclear deterrent and
provided Iraq's scientists an opportunity to better organize the
program. The Iraqi leader devoted significantly more resources toward
pursuing nuclear weapons after the Israeli assault. As \[political
scientist Dan\] Reiter notes, 'the Iraqi nuclear program increased from
a program of 400 scientists and \$400 million to one of 7,000 scientists
and \$10 billion.'"

More importantly, these sentiments are reminiscent of the Bush
administration's failed policy toward Iran in the early 2000s. When
approached with deals that would have seen all of Iran's enriched
uranium converted into fuel rods --- and would have capped the program
with some 100 odd centrifuges --- the Bush administration balked.

Vice President Dick Cheney even once said, "We don't negotiate with
evil; we defeat it." The results? Negotiations collapsed and Iran went
from only a few installed centrifuges at the beginning of the Bush
administration to about 6,000 by the end.

While many conservatives are quick to spurn negotiations with Iran, they
seem to have done very little in the way of analyzing what [a war with
Iran would]{.underline} actually look like. Maybe they need a reminder.

It [would neither be quick nor painless]{.underline}. As former
Brookings Institution fellow Noah Shachtman described in 2012, it would
be a [major major military action, with little chance of lasting
success.]{.underline}

"Setting back Iran's nuclear efforts will need to be an all-out effort,
with squadrons of bombers and fighter jets, teams of commandos, rings of
interceptor missiles and whole Navy carrier strike groups --- plus
enough drones, surveillance gear, tanker aircraft and logistical support
to make such a massive mission go. And all of it, [at best, would buy
the U.S. and Israel another decade of a nuke-free Iran."]{.underline}

[Even a limited strike by U.S. air and naval forces would be
massive]{.underline}, according to Anthony Cordesman of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.

"It is not a simple mission of bombers flying in and out of Iran, this
is a complicated Offensive Air Strike that will involve many aircraft,
each with its own role, such as Combat Aircarft \[sic\] whose role is to
suppress enemy air defenses along the way, aircraft that fly fighter
escort with the bombers, aircraft that carry specialized electronic
warfare equipment to jam enemy radars and communications., plus probably
air-to-air refueling along the way in and out of Iran."

Even then, Cordesman added, "depending on the forces allocated and
duration of air strikes, it is unlikely that an air campaign alone could
alone terminate Iran's program. The possibility of dispersed facilities
complicates any assessment of a potential mission success, making it
unclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be on Iran's nuclear
facilities."

Further complicating matters, U.S. military forces would not be able to
simply focus on striking Iranian nuclear targets. They would also have
to safeguard the Strait of Hormuz --- a narrow waterway connecting the
Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf --- through which some 20 percent of
the world's oil passes, as well as countless other U.S. and allied
strategic assets in the area.

Indeed, even a temporary closure of the strait through Iranian
deployment of mines, mini-subs, shore-to-ship missile batteries and
patrol boats could have a **[serious effect upon the world
economy.]{.underline}**

The Federation of American Scientists estimates that the "the rough
effects of U.S. \[military\] action against Iran on the global economy
--- measured only in the first three months of actualization ---
\[could\] range from [total losses of approximately \$60 billion on one
end of the scale to more than \$2 trillion to the world economy on the
other end."]{.underline}

All in all, a U.S. or coalition attack against Iran now would be like
setting off a bomb in a gunpowder factory. As Cordesman noted, **[any
"military strike \[against Iran\] could be destabilizing for the entire
Middle East region and potentially generate a nuclear weapons race in
that part of the world."]{.underline}**

[War with Iran is no joke]{.underline}. Critics of a deal with Iran
should not treat it like one. A breakdown in negotiations will have
serious repercussions for the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy. That
being the case, lawmakers should be more careful when threatening to use
U.S. military force.

The enormous costs involved in engaging U.S. forces against Iran, both
human and materiel, should not be bandied about lightly.

As Levin wrote, "We owe it to our friends and allies in the region, and
to our men and women in uniform who might have to risk their lives if
diplomacy fails, to give negotiations every chance to succeed."

We should listen to his advice.

areas]{.underline}, identified in the proceeding chapters, [are likely
to mature into **global security threats** in the immediate
future]{.underline}. As the case study on South Korea suggest, [the
overlapping security issues associated with economic decline and reduced
military spending by the United States will **affect allied confidence
in America's security guarantees**]{.underline}. The study shows that
[this outcome could cause **regional instability** or realignments of

potential risks associated with **stolen or loose WMD**]{.underline},
[resulting from poor security, can also pose a threat to U.S. national
security]{.underline}. The case study on Pakistan, Syria and North Korea
show how [financial constraints affect weapons security making weapons
vulnerable to theft, and how financial factors can influence WMD
proliferation]{.underline} by contributing to the motivating factors
behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons technology. The
[inherent vulnerabilities within the global financial markets will
provide terrorists' organizations and other non-state
groups]{.underline}, who object to the current international system or
distribution of power, [with opportunities to disrupt global finance and
perhaps weaken America's status]{.underline}.

[The U.S. is responsible for crimes against humanity regarding Iran and

what \@SecPompeo? It\'s the Yemenis themselves who\'re responsible for

6/5/17, JD)

[Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed their
ties with Qatar]{.underline} on Monday, accusing it of supporting
terrorism and opening up the worst rift in years among some of the most
powerful states in the Arab world.

[Iran \-- long at odds with Saudi Arabia and a behind-the-scenes target
of the move \-- immediately blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for
setting the stage during his recent trip to Riyadh.]{.underline}

Gulf Arab states and Egypt have already long resented Qatar\'s support
for Islamists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood which they regard as a
dangerous political enemy.

[The coordinated move, with Yemen and Libya\'s eastern-based government
joining in later, created a dramatic rift among the Arab
nations]{.underline}, many of which are in OPEC.

Announcing the closure of transport ties with Qatar, the three Gulf
states gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave. Qatar was
also expelled from the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.

Oil giant Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of backing militant groups \-- some
backed by regional arch-rival Iran \-- and broadcasting their ideology,
an apparent reference to Qatar\'s influential state-owned satellite
channel al Jazeera.

\"(Qatar) embraces multiple terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at
disturbing stability in the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood,
ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Qaeda, and promotes the message and schemes
of these groups through their media constantly,\" Saudi state news
agency SPA said.

It accused Qatar of supporting what it described as Iranian-backed
militants in its restive and largely Shi\'ite Muslim-populated Eastern
region of Qatif and in Bahrain.

Qatar said it was facing a campaign aimed at weakening it, denying it
was interfering in the affairs of other countries.

#### Iran blames the US for Middle East tensions

Tehran warns against \'escalation,'" ABC News,
<https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-iranian-general-warns-us-war-63890003>,

[Iran\'s president has accused the United States of fueling tensions in
an already volatile region,]{.underline} as the crisis between the two
countries escalates.

The official [IRNA news agency quoted Sunday Hassan Rouhani as saying
the \"interventionist military presence\" of the U.S. is responsible for
the Middle East\'s problems.]{.underline}

Rouhani also denounced what Iran alleges was the incursion of its
airspace by a U.S. military drone, which Tehran shot down on Thursday.

Rouhani said: [\"We expect international bodies to show proper reaction
to the invasion move.]{.underline}\" His remarks came during a meeting
with the president of IPU, or Inter-Parliamentary Union, Gabriela
Cuevas, in Tehran.

The U.S. says the drone was flying above international waters near the
Persian Gulf.

### \--Iran War Impact Ext.

#### Iran and the US are on the brink of war---one that would be immeasurably bad for both countries---sheer death, international perception of the US as being in the wrong, regional spillover, and military implications

**RT International**, **6-22**-2019, \"US war with Iran would be a
disaster with ripple effects that 'could last decades',\"
https://www.rt.com/usa/459342-us-iran-war-disaster/

The [situation around Iran has been cranked up to fever
pitch]{.underline}, and another [American war in the Middle East seems
just around the corner]{.underline} -- [a war that spells devastation
for both the region and Trump\'s presidency]{.underline}, analysts
believe.

The US is allegedly mulling a war plan against Iran with 120,000 troops
potentially involved, according to a recent New York Times report which
cited unnamed officials. US President Donald Trump denied that his
administration has been planning to send troops, but added that if they
did, it would be "a hell of a lot more" than what the Times report
suggested.

Nonetheless, Washington has been notching up war talk in recent days and
weeks, with Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo touring the world
threatening Iran at every stop -- at times even going out of the way to
make these treats from more strategically-important spots, like
Iraq.]{.underline}

The chant has been that the US doesn\'t want war, but stands ready to
hit "swiftly and decisively" should Iran or its nebulous "proxies"
attempt any attack against American "interests or citizens." As if on
cue, such an apparent attempt came on Sunday, when oil tankers -- two of
them Saudi Arabian, one bound for the US -- were hit by "sabotage" just
off the Strait of Hormuz.

Nobody was hurt, no oil was spilled, and no-one has officially accused
Iran -- yet, -- but unofficially, there already are reports that US
officials are blaming the convenient culprit. Trump, in particular,
didn\'t wait for confirmation, threatening the Iranians would "suffer
greatly" if they "do anything."

And while analysts in even the mainstream media appear to be somewhat
alarmed by the looming war, obviously spurred on by the militancy of
Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, influential critical
voices among Washington politicians are all but absent -- despite the
eerie similarities with the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

That one became a quagmire that swallowed an estimated 400,000 lives,
over 4,000 of them American troops, as well as billions of dollars. Even
the fact that Trump is about to break another of his platform promises
-- to end senseless American wars abroad -- can\'t seem to inspire a
rebuke among his many opponents in Washington.

While the cons[equences of war with Iran in terms of **death and
destruction would be "literally incalculable**," starting such a
conflict could also be a colossal mistake for Trump
politically,]{.underline} James Jatras, a former US diplomat and
Republican Senate policy adviser told RT.

Jatras said that while the White House strategists and war hawks like
Bolton and Pompeo may "think" they know how events would play it, these
things "very rarely actually go according to plan."

Trump will have "betrayed everything he promised" to the electorate if
he dives into [another potentially endless conflict]{.underline}, having
promised no more pointless regime change wars during his 2016 campaign.
At that point, Jatras said, his presidency would look more like a "third
term for George W. Bush."

A [war with Iran would also undoubtedly put the US's regional allies,
Israel and Saudi Arabia, at risk]{.underline}, although Bolton and
Pompeo seem determined to bring regime change to Tehran despite all
these potential dangers, regional and otherwise.

Jatras believes such thinking is the result of "imperial hubris." Even
though Washington may understand Iran's military capabilities, there are
still [influential figures in the White House who are "so arrogant" and
believe so much in the US's "overwhelming superiority" that they believe
Iran would turn out to be a "paper tiger."]{.underline}

While [Israel and Saudi Arabia may believe they will benefit in the long
run from a US attack on their Iranian foe]{.underline}, it is almost
"**[100 percent" certain]{.underline}** that if Washington attacks Iran,
[Iran will attack both "facilitator" countries in return]{.underline},
according to Foad Izadi, professor of political communication at the
University of Tehran.

[If the conflict did prompt Tehran to attack Israel and Saudi Arabia,
Izadi said the Israelis and Saudis would want to fight Iran "**to the
last American soldier**]{.underline}" --- a comment which should give
American citizens and media pundits pause for thought before
cheerleading for another disastrous regime change war, as many did in
the lead up to the Iraq war.

'[No winners' and everyone knows it]{.underline}

The [sheer catastrophic scale a US-Iran war would spill out
into]{.underline}, is exactly what stands in the way of it actually
happening, says Vladimir Sazhin, a senior fellow at the Iran sector of
the Oriental Studies Research Institute of the Russian Academy of
Sciences. Whatever the belligerent rhetoric by Trump\'s hawk nest or
Rouhani\'s generals, [neither really want the war]{.underline}.

"[Nobody wins from this, a big war would be a disaster for the Middle
East]{.underline}," Sazhin told RT. With [Washington and Tehran mutually
declaring each other\'s militaries 'terrorist
organizations,']{.underline} there\'s plenty of casus belli -- but all
the buildup is just psychological warfare, he believes. About the only
likely way that Tehran can provoke a strike is by following up on
threats to block off the Strait of Hormuz.

"Should the Iranians do that -- it\'s not difficult even without a
military force -- then the [US and their allies... won\'t stand idly by
and will strike]{.underline}," Sazhin said. Even then, however, he
believes "it won\'t go as far as any kind of massive warfare, because
both in [Washington and in Tehran everyone understands it won\'t result
in anything good."]{.underline}

Can Iran put up a fight?

Should it come to blows, Iran\'s chances look bleak, Sazhin says. Its
ground forces can\'t stand up to the US\' and allies\', and while [it
has missiles capable of reaching nearly every American and Israeli base
in the region]{.underline}, Israeli missile defenses are good enough to
intercept them, and the US has recently bolstered its force of Patriot
air defense systems in the area.

[One battlefield where the US and its allies could be in for more than
they bargained for is the sea, thanks to Iran\'s swarms of tiny, fast
strike boats known as dhows]{.underline}.

"[Iran has a very significant small-size fleet]{.underline}, belonging
to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. These are [small boats, very
high-speed... which zip around, carrying various weapons, including
recoilless rifles and even small missiles]{.underline}. Besides, they
are [almost invisible to radar]{.underline} thanks to their small size.
[There are a lot of them -- like mosquitoes, they can emerge from bays
and inlets, chase down enemy vessels and destroy them,]{.underline}"
Sazhin said.

[Iran\'s other major advantages are morale and resilience]{.underline},
says Izadi.

"The US military is larger than Iran\'s military, but [Iran showed in
the eight years of the Iran-Iraq war that the Iranian people are
resilient]{.underline}. They may be weaker in terms of military
capability, but they are [stronger in terms of resilience against
foreign interference]{.underline}."

Besides, it would be a "war of choice" for the US, driven by nothing
else than the ambitions of war hawks in Washington. Echoing Jatras,
Izadi said this would make war a "[disaster" for Trump\'s image, because
the world\'s "public opinion will be with Iran and against the
US.]{.underline}"

Ultimately, however, there would be **[no way to contain the
catastrophic consequences of a conflict with Iran in terms of sheer
death, destruction and regional spillover, which Izadi said could have a
"lasting effects for decades."]{.underline}**

and [helped catalyze the rise of the Islamic State
group.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/isis-origins-anbari-zarqawi/577030/)]{.underline}

Iran has a population of about 82 million people, and its military is
ranked as [the 14th most
powerful](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=iran).
According to recent estimates, Iran has [523,000 active military
personnel](https://www.csis.org/analysis/arab-gulf-states-and-iran-military-spending-modernization-and-shifting-military-balance) in
addition to 250,000 reserve personnel.

Comparatively, Iraq had a population of about 25 million people, and the
Iraqi military had [fewer than 450,000
personnel](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/iraq-iraqs-prewar-military-capabilities) when
the US invaded over a decade ago.

Iran is also much bigger than Iraq geographically. It has [591,000
square miles of
land](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html) versus
Iraq\'s 168,000 square miles, and its influence has grown as the power
of its rival Iraq collapsed in the wake of the US war there.

[If the US launched an attack against Iran, it would also reverberate
across the Middle East. Iran has proxies throughout the region and is
allied with militant groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. A revised
Pentagon estimate released in April found Iranian proxy forces
killed [at least 608 US
troops](https://www.newsweek.com/iran-us-iraq-war-troops-killed-efps-shiite-militias-1385990) in
Iraq between 2003 and 2011.]{.underline}

Moreover, [Iran shares a border with a number of countries the US
considers allies and has a military presence in --- including Turkey,
Iraq, and Afghanistan. None of these countries are especially stable at
the moment, as they all continue to deal with ongoing conflicts and
their consequences]{.underline} [(including millions of displaced
people).](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/middle-east-and-north-africa.html)

[In terms of other geopolitical blowback, Iran is [allied with Russia
and
China](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/25/moscow-and-beijing-have-tehrans-back/),]{.underline}
and it\'s unclear how these major powers might react if conflict breaks
out. [Key US allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, which are
adversaries of Iran and just a stone\'s throw away from it, would also
likely get sucked into a US-Iran war.]{.underline}

"I think as far as I can see, it is America, which is making all the
provocation," Mahathir told CNBC's [Tanvir
Gill](https://www.cnbc.com/tanvir-gill/) on Saturday, when asked which
side might be responsible for miscalculations.

"First, they withdrew from the (nuclear) treaty, and now they're sending
warships to the Gulf, and doing things that will provoke Iran," he told
CNBC in Bangkok, Thailand where Asian leaders were gathered for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.

drone](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/us-drone-shot-down-by-iranian-missile-in-international-airspace.html)]{.underline}.

The shooting of the drone prompted U.S. President [Donald

on several Iranian
targets](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/trump-approves-military-strikes-on-iran-then-pulls-back-report.html) ---
but he abruptly called off the attacks late Thursday. The president

would have been disproportionate to the downing of an unmanned drone.

"I am in no hurry," Trump said on Twitter Friday. "Our Military is
rebuilt, new, and ready to go."

[Even before the latest escalation in tensions, the two countries
appeared to be heading closer toward a military conflict]{.underline}

counter Iran, amid allegations the Islamic country was responsible for
attacks on oil tankers in the region. Tehran has rejected those
accusations.

Mahathir on Saturday warned: "[If they go to war, it will not be Iran
against America. It will be a world war." He explained that other
countries that do not want to see nuclear weapons being used "will have
to come in and put a stop to it."]{.underline}

### Asia Pivot Add on 

#### Continuing commitments in the Middle East through arms sales traps the US in a foreign policy quagmire that turns every objective.

Institute, \"Let\'s Face It: US Policy in the Middle East Has Failed,\"

[The ongoing controversy surrounding the murder of a dissident Saudi
journalist and Saudi Arabia's brutal bombing campaign of a largely
defenseless neighboring Yemen, which has come with an enormous human
toll, have elicited increased scrutiny over the U.S.-Saudi
alliance]{.underline}. The White House remains supportive of Riyadh,
both diplomatically and with continued military aid. [Republicans have
offered mildly critical words for the Saudi regime, while an increasing
number of Democrats are calling for a fundamental reassessment of the
U.S.-Saudi relationship.]{.underline}

Such a reassessment is long overdue. Washington's partnership with
Riyadh has often been treated as sacrosanct, at least here in the
nation's capital. It should have been clear long ago that [the
Saudis]{.underline} are not good allies. In fact, they [often act in
ways that undermine U.S. interests. Backing one of the world's most
appallingly tyrannical regimes to the hilt has actually not been a net
positive for U.S. national security or for stability in the
region.]{.underline}

[With any luck, the unfolding drama over the U.S.-Saudi partnership will
extend beyond merely this troubled bilateral relationship to U.S. policy
in the Middle East as a whole.]{.underline} The United States is deeply
entangled in this region, with roughly 50,000 boots on the ground,
dozens of permanent military bases and deployed assets, and a staggering
sum of taxpayer dollars, essentially wasted. [We are engaged in active
combat operations in at least five countries across the Middle East and
North Africa, bogged down in endless counter-insurgency campaigns,
grisly counter-terrorism operations, and inglorious proxy
wars.]{.underline} Washington also tasks Central Command with the
responsibility of supporting, training, arming, and stabilizing various
corrupt dictatorships, while we also try to put the squeeze on Iran.

A well-timed paper by Chatham House's Micah Zenko clarifies [the failure
of U.S. regional objectives, despite the gargantuan resources devoted to
them]{.underline}. Zenko lists four primary objectives: (1) [enhancing
regional security and reducing political instability within Middle East
governments]{.underline}; (2) [preventing the emergence of terrorist
safe havens;]{.underline} (3) [ensuring the free flow of energy
resources; and]{.underline} (4) [enabling allies to build enough
military capacity to defend themselves.]{.underline}

We have failed at each of these. Indeed, [far from serving a stabilizing
role, U.S. policy has rather plainly destabilized the
region]{.underline}. The [Iraq]{.underline} War [upended the Middle
East, empowered Iran, and fueled a new generation of jihadist
terrorists]{.underline}. Washington bungled a series of changes in the
[Egypt]{.underline}ian regime and [helped]{.underline} (along with other
external actors) [fuel Syria]{.underline}'s civil war. The Obama
administration's [Libya]{.underline} war [created anarchy and new
refugee flows. And]{.underline} our longstanding [support for Saudi
Arabia as a balance to Iran has not only failed to roll back Iran's
regional activity, but it has also emboldened Riyadh to act aggressively
and pick fights with several of its neighbors.]{.underline}

#### Specifically, a continued focus on Saudi Arabia poisons the well of the US grand strategy and distracts from bigger threats in the Asia Pacific.

Evan **Resnick 18** {Assistant Professor and Coordinator of the United
States Programme at RSIS, "The Case of Jamal Khashoggi: America's
Obsolete Alliance with Saudi Arabia," *RSIS*,
<https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/46529>, Published 10/31/18, Accessed
6/18/19} //RG

The Khashoggi scandal should serve as [a wakeup call, not only for
decades of US obsequiousness towards its unsavoury Saudi ally of
convenience, but also and more importantly, for America's drifting grand
strategy. Since 9/11, successive administrations in Washington DC have
focused their attention and resources overarchingly on the Middle
East.]{.underline}

[By comparison, they have been habitually distracted from events in the
Asia Pacific, which]{.underline} is the only part of the world that
[hosts a viable peer competitor capable of threatening the survival of
the US, namely a rising and expansionist China]{.underline}. Even the
Obama administration, which ostentatiously embarked on a "rebalance to
Asia," nevertheless found itself surging tens of thousands of troops
into the unnecessary and still ongoing war in Afghanistan and
redeploying thousands of troops to Iraq to combat ISIS.

[It would behoove the Trump administration to consider the Khashoggi
killing an opportunity to finish the job that Trump's predecessor failed
to complete, by prudently reorienting US strategy from the increasingly
peripheral Middle East to the increasingly integral Asia
Pacific.]{.underline} The recent repackaging of America\'s strategic
interests in Asia under an Indo-Pacific vision requires substantive
policy attention by Washington DC. [One step President Trump can offer
as redress is to initiate the attachment of onerous new conditions to
any future US arms sales to Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

7/9/18, GDI-GFerrer-Falto\]

[While many states in east Asia are economically powerful, and while
regional forms of interdependence should not be downplayed, many of
these states are also largely dependent for their security on the United
States, primarily as a hedge against a rapidly rising China, and the
United States is now committed to a buildup of its military capacity in
the region]{.underline}. The same 2012 document makes explicit the
synergy between US strategic and economic interests, as well as the
leverage that US mediation capacity delivers[: the 'maintenance of peace
\[and\] stability, the free flow of commerce, and of U.S. influence in
this dynamic region will depend in part on an underlying balance of
military capability and presence'.]{.underline}72

Indeed, [concerns over rising Chinese power have seen a wide range of
advances recently in security cooperation with the United
States]{.underline}. In particular, [long-established military exercises
have been significantly expanded]{.underline}. Operation Balikatan, the
annual US--Philippines military exercise, doubled in size in 2015, with
the number of troops involved rising from 5,500 to 11,500.73 This
followed on from the signing in 2014 of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement, which has once again allowed the stationing of US troops on
Philippine soil. [Similar agreements have been replicated across the
region, with states including Australia and even Singapore permitting
the stationing of American military personnel and hardware within their
sovereign territory]{.underline},74 [underscoring the manner in which
rising Chinese power is coming to reshape the region\'s security
dynamics]{.underline}. [In terms of structural power, this trend is
likely to provide opportunities for the United States to increase its
institutional and economic influence]{.underline}. [Not only does it
provide more positive incentives for states to operate within US-centred
networks, but it is also likely to deepen their reliance on US security
guarantees]{.underline}. Thus, much as was the case throughout the Cold
War, [fear of US disengagement may result in concessions in non-security
fields]{.underline}. Given this, and in keeping with our case selection
criteria, what can we say about how the 2008 financial crisis and its
aftermath have affected US leveraging capacity?

Saudi Arabia," *War on the Rocks*, 2019,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/)>

[According to the 2019 Military Balance, most of Saudi Arabia's
equipment is American or French in origin]{.underline}, such as the M1A2
Abrams and AMX-30 tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and F-15C/D
fighter jets. Saudi Arabia has some equipment manufactured wholly or in
part in Germany, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado ground
attack craft, but these weapons are a small portion of its complete
arsenal. [A U.S. embargo would send an important signal to the allies
who also supply Saudi Arabia, allowing them to explain participation in
the embargo to their own domestic constituencies. This is especially
important for countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom,
that need to export arms to keep their own production lines
running.]{.underline} While the research shows that sustaining an arms
embargo is often the most difficult step, embargoes can restrain sending
states' arms exports. Even if a U.S. embargo won't have a direct effect
on Saudi Arabia on its own, an embargo is important for building
coalitions for a more expansive embargo that could affect Saudi
behavior.

The Difficulty of Stopping Atrocities

Beyond signaling, we know U.S. arms sales often end up in the wrong
hands, and have been used in Yemen. The Saudi-led war in Yemen has led
to starvation conditions, caused thousands of civilian casualties, and
has led to the displacement of millions of people. The United Nations
estimates that 80 percent of Yemen's population -- 24 million people --
require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, and that the
severity of the situation is increasing. Would an arms embargo create
meaningful change in Yemen?

An initial effect of an embargo is that [Saudi Arabia would have to work
harder to access war materiel.]{.underline} As Jonathan Caverley noted[,
more than 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's arms delivered in the past five
years came from the United States]{.underline}. Even if this percentage
decreases over time[, it will be costly for Saudi Arabia to transition
to a primarily Russian- or Chinese-supplied military]{.underline}.
Though Saudi Arabia might be willing to pay this cost[, it
would]{.underline} still have to pay, and [take]{.underline} the [time
to transition]{.underline} to its new weapons systems. This would
represent a brief break in hostilities that could facilitate the
delivery of aid and assistance in Yemen.

U.S. forces the issue.

[[Trump has
said](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/10/11/trump-doubles-down-hes-not-stopping-saudi-arms-sales/)
that if the United States doesn't sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, then
Russia or China will. But Saudi Arabia needs American spare parts, and
it also buys U.S. weapons partly for the implicit security guarantee
that comes with them. No other country can provide that security
blanket.]{.underline}

"The Saudi military is dependent on American spare parts, logistics and
munitions," noted Bruce Riedel, a Middle East expert at the Brookings
Institution. "If Washington uses its enormous leverage, the Saudis have
no choice but to end the war."

We are drifting toward an increased risk of a collision with Iran, and
the U.S. Navy in particular worries about an accident in the Persian
Gulf that escalates. In 1988, in a similar period of tensions, the
United States mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger plane, killing
290 people on board.

So of course let's work to reduce the risk of a war directly with Iran.
But let's also not forget this old, shameful war outside Iran's borders:
It's time to end American support for the bombing and starvation of
children in Yemen.

### AT: Saudi Relations DA

#### The Saudi partnership is meaningless and counterproductive if there are no limits to what we'll tolerate.

Foreign Relations Committee, "We must demand accountability for Saudi
Arabia's behavior," *Washington Post*,

[Reports indicate that Saudi Arabia dispatched a hit squad that brazenly
abducted and murdered Khashoggi]{.underline}, a U.S. resident, in the
Saudi Consulate in Istanbul --- [simply because he regularly criticized
his government in public]{.underline}. The Saudis have issued blanket
denials and refused to provide any evidence to the contrary, arrogantly
assuming they don't owe us an explanation.

When I came to Congress a little more than 10 years ago, support for
Saudi Arabia was broad and bipartisan. But now, [as the new crown prince
engages in increasingly reckless behavior, more and more of us are
wondering whether **our ally's** actions are in **our own** best
interests. The list of erratic actions]{.underline} from Mohammed bin
Salman [is long: the jailing of royal family members, the detention of
the Lebanese prime minister, a nonsensical feud with Qatar, the growing
internal repression of political speech and the disastrous war in
Yemen.]{.underline}

[These counterproductive moves have been met with increasing criticism
on Capitol Hill and have prompted new questions about the Saudi project
that is perhaps most damaging to global security]{.underline}: the
decades-long effort to sow across the world the seeds of Salafist Islam,
often a crucial ingredient of the Sunni [extremism that fuels terrorist
groups]{.underline} such as the Islamic State and al- Qaeda.

This administration appears unlikely to take decisive action, so it's up
to Congress to determine the consequences. [One of those consequences
must be ending our military assistance, which has given the Saudis free
rein in the ongoing horror in Yemen.]{.underline}

#### The Aff doesn't necessarily sever the alliance between Saudi and the US -- merely demands that our relationship be changed for meaningful progress.

**WSJ** Editorial Board **18** {The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board

Declaration of Independence and *Wealth of Nations*, "America and the
Saudis," *WSJ*,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-and-the-saudis-1540159637}

[The "fight" story]{.underline} also [conveniently lays blame on
lower-ranking officials while effectively absolving members of the royal
family, especially]{.underline} the Crown Prince known as
[MBS]{.underline}. The Saudis say they've arrested 18 officials and
sacked five others. Several are part of MBS's inner circle, and it's
unlikely they would have acted without at least the tacit assent of the
Crown Prince. [Khashoggi]{.underline}, who had a wide following in the
Middle East, [had criticized the Crown Prince]{.underline} for his
authoritarian tactics in trying to reform the Kingdom.

On Sunday Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir called it a "rogue
operation" that neither MBS nor "the senior leadership of our
intelligence service" was aware of. This would be more believable if the
Saudis hadn't taken 18 days to say it. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is
promising to reveal Turkey's account of what happened on Tuesday, and
that could further undermine Saudi credibility.

[The Trump Administration's response to all this hasn't exactly been a
model of moral or strategic clarity. Mr. Trump has rambled from
promising "severe" consequences to extolling U.S. arms sales to
threatening sanctions to a seeming apologia for MBS as an "incredible
ally."]{.underline} On Saturday he finally got closer to the truth when
he told the Washington Post that he doubted the Saudi explanation.
"Obviously there's been deception, and there's been lies," Mr. Trump
said.

[The U.S. goal should be to preserve the U.S.-Saudi alliance while
making clear that murdering journalists is unacceptable and that MBS's
erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral
relationship.]{.underline} The U.S. can't dictate to King Salman who
should run his government, but [MBS also can't be allowed to conclude
that America thinks this is no big deal. Otherwise he'll keep creating
trouble for his own country and the U.S.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia is an \"important security partner,\" Miller said, but not
a true American ally]{.underline} as Trump said given it doesn\'t share
US values.

With that said, the strategic partnership between the US and Saudis that
dates back to the 1940s has begun to crumble in recent years.

[For decades, the US has provided security, while the Saudis have
provided oil. But the US no longer needs Saudi oil]{.underline}, Miller
said, as the shale revolution has made it virtually energy independent.

Indeed, it\'s the US, not Saudi Arabia, that is now the [world\'s
largest](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053)crude-oil
producer.

[\'Saudi Arabia needs us a lot more than we need them\']{.underline}

At the end of the day, Saudi Arabia now needs the US \"a lot more than
we need them,\" Gen. Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied
Commander, told CNN on Tuesday in response to the president\'s
statement.

Clark said that [the Saudis \"need\" US protection but the US no longer
needs their oil, adding that though it might be \"inconvenient\" in the
short-run for the US government to take actions that hurt the royal
family there\'s also important strategic value in upholding American
ideals.]{.underline}

\"[If we\'re going to have America in the world that we want to see, we
have to stand up for our values, and we have to put those values up
front,\"]{.underline} Clark said. \"We need to help the Saudis come in
our direction. And calling it like it is on this would help them.\"

[\'We\'ve allowed the US-Saudi relationship to get out of
control\']{.underline}

The Economics of Arms Sales

[Grand [claims](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/21/18003696/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-weapons-jobs) about
the importance of arms sales to maintaining American jobs and boosting
the]{.underline} domestic **[economy are often
exaggerated]{.underline}** [so that private defense companies can keep
deals that]{.underline} **[generate enormous profit]{.underline}**.
[Private sector defense workers only make up about [0.5
percent](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/21/18003696/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-weapons-jobs) of
the total US labor force and almost none of them depend specifically on
arms sales to Saudi Arabia for their livelihood. Even if the deals
ended, companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing would
only [lose](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/saudi-arms-sale-limits-would-have-slight-impact-on-us-defense-firms.html) about
2 percent of revenue. In fact, these arms deals create significantly
more job opportunities for Saudis than for Americans. Empirically,
Trump's plan will create nearly [ten thousand
jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-saudi-arms-deal-job-creation-2018-10) in
Saudi ports but only five hundred US jobs overall.]{.underline}

**[US arms sales to Saudi Arabia have hurt the US economy by diverting
funds away from better economic growth opportunities]{.underline}**.
[Investments into military jobs are often [less
effective](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-is-the-top-buyer-of-u-s-weapons/) than
federal spending on education, healthcare, or infrastructure. Professor
Heidi Garrett-Peltier of Brown
University [sums](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2017/Job%20Opportunity%20Cost%20of%20War%20-%20HGP%20-%20FINAL.pdf) it
up: by increasing military spending, America pays an economic
opportunity cost that sacrifices the chance to fund programs that are
better at job creation. These sectors create many more jobs than defense
spending does and can generate better value for the overall economy. If
increasing job opportunities and expanding the American economy is the
priority, then, military contracts are far from the most effective
solution.]{.underline}

Defense contractors are economically-driven corporations that seek
higher profits. To avoid the political backlash of Saudi arms sales in
their pursuits, contractors tend to claim that they are both helping the
American economy and assisting the US government's Saudi relations.
Lockheed Martin alone
will [acquire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/25/defense-contractors-stand-with-white-house-saudi-arms-sales/?utm_term=.f14799a8b3b6) about
\$900 million from Saudi sales in 2020 and an additional \$450 million
contract if Saudi Arabia decides to deploy an American ballistic missile
defense system. Contractors like Lockheed Martin are increasing revenue
streams at the expense of millions of lives in Yemen. The United States
should not continue to prioritize defense contractor business
opportunities over its capability to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in
Yemen and the continuously dire implications of Saudi Arabia weapons
purchases.

**[Ending the arms sales will also lift the veil on the Trump
Administration's disingenuous economic justifications for politically
expedient Saudi relations]{.underline}**. The Trump Administration has
long used economic arguments to cover for their political and military
desires. However, the arms sales to Saudi Arabia transcend economics. By
maintaining Saudi arms sales, the United States
is [declining](https://duckofminerva.com/2018/10/with-arms-sales-its-not-just-the-economy-stupid.html) to
hold countries accountable in exchange for the comfortable benefits
offered by the status quo. [The administration has attempted to simplify
the arms sales issue to make the controversy appear more palatable. In
reality, the arms sales are diverting American dollars to a sector that
is relatively ineffective at job development, implicitly condoning human
rights abuses that stem from those sales and harming American foreign
policy itself.]{.underline}

The Foreign Policy of Arms Sales

Many supporters of arms sales, including the current US government,
are [concerned ](https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea)about
protecting US influence and stabilizing the Saudi-Iranian relationship.
They argue that cutting arms sales would reduce the US' presence,
embolden Iran and allow the Yemen conflict to further spiral out of
control. Iran is backing Houthi rebels that are fighting against Saudi
Arabia. If the US scales back its commitments to Saudi Arabia, Iran
could expand its regional influence and its purportedly violent
tendencies. However, as mentioned earlier, it is important to note that
US arms sales are themselves perpetuating the conflict by injecting
weapons of war into Yemen. Saudi Arabia is the medium through which
myriad parties acquire arms. Ending the arms sales will mitigate Saudi
Arabia and Iran's thirsts for power by constraining the conflict's
capacity for violence.

While the US government suggests that arms sales incline Saudi Arabia to
cooperate with the US' agenda, the reverse is true. Rather than the
United States gaining leverage through arms sales, Saudi Arabia has
gained more power instead. Patricia Sullivan of Foreign Policy
Analysis [writes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf4e/e4125c4d788098a9fc326cb32856b49df5b7.pdf) that,
empirically, states that receive military aid are less cooperative than
states that do not. States that receive military aid are willing to take
advantage of their leverage because the US often refrains from holding
allied states completely accountable to their commitments or to American
principles. Khashoggi's murder casts a long shadow in that regard: Trump
has chosen
to [turn](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/21/18003696/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-weapons-jobs) a
blind eye to Saudi Arabia's blatant disregard for civil liberties in the
professed service of protecting America's economy. Though not anywhere
near as powerful as the US, Saudi Arabia has escaped the Khashoggi
situation with its US arms deals intact.

The United States continues to play a preeminent role in Saudi weapons
acquisitions. European countries
have [reduced](https://www.ft.com/content/dd836c34-d60b-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8) their
arms sales in response to Khashoggi's death while the United States has
increased sales. There are multiple actors in the international game but
the US has the biggest muscles to flex, economically and diplomatically
speaking. Nearly all of Saudi Arabia's weapons [have American
parts](https://qz.com/1514582/us-supports-saudi-war-in-yemen-even-after-senate-votes-no/) or
are maintained by American technicians. Saudi Arabia cannot find an easy
replacement for its US weapons imports: it would take decades for Saudi
Arabia to implement different systems and the transition costs of such a
switch would be monumental.

**[By ending arms sales, the United States can assert its sway over
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**: if Saudi weapons and systems are so reliant
on US assistance, perhaps the Saudis should be compelled to comply with
new US terms; [Such a move would help change the narrative that the US
will never use its military aid leverage over other
countries]{.underline}. **[If the United States suspended arms sales to
Saudi Arabia, other major arms exporters might either
take [similar](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-saudi-arabia-arms-deals-jamal-khashoggi-dead-murder-merkel-trump-a8595876.html)
measures or continue to follow their own preexisting
scalebacks.]{.underline}**

End Saudi Arms Sales

[The United States' arms sales to Saudi Arabia are flawed in
humanitarian, economic and political terms. Rather than search for
innovative ways to justify protecting arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the
United States can]{.underline} and should [work to legitimately foster
sustainable peace and stability in the Middle East]{.underline}. In
short, [the United States ought to reverse its wrongs by ending its arms
sales to Saudi Arabia. Doing so will not only allow war-torn Yemen to
begin to recover, but would also allow the United States to better
revitalize its own economy, and reassert its military leverage and
international authority to hold allied states like Saudi Arabia
accountable for their agendas and actions.]{.underline}

### AT: Saudi Deterrence

#### Turn -- arm sales in the modern age are not an effective deterrent.

Anthony H. **Cordesman 18** {Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the

Gulf, and the United States: Abizaid\'s Mission Possible?,\" *Center for

Another area where Ambassador must deal with U.S. mistakes and problems
is [the recent U.S. emphasis on the sheer volume of U.S. arms sales to
the Gulf]{.underline}. A strong U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia can be a
key voice in persuading the President that focusing on high levels of
U.S. arms sales [does not really U.S. strategic interests. **More U.S.
arms sales often mean less** in terms of regional stability and
security.]{.underline}

[What the U.S. needs from its Arab Gulf security partners is far more
effective, interoperable, and integrated forces that can perform the
right missions in deterring and defending against Iran and
counterterrorism -- not more revenues from selling them
arms.]{.underline}

As noted earlier, the key immediate security priorities in the Arab Gulf
are integrated missile/air defense, effective counterterrorism forces,
and counters to Iran\'s steadily more capable mix of naval-missile-air
threats to shipping in the Gulf, nearby waters, and the Red Sea. [At
present, each state tends to spend far more on poorly coordinated
showpiece efforts than it would cost to fund a proper share of the
forces that are really needed.]{.underline}

Even seen from the most selfish American perspective, [the U.S. benefits
far more from sound increases in Arab partner security forces, and being
able to limit the forces it forward deploys, than it gains from selling
arms]{.underline} the Arab Gulf states do not need. [The cost-benefits
to both the U.S. and its allies rise by an order of magnitude if more
effective Arab Gulf forces deter even a relatively low-level conflict
between the U.S. and Iran.]{.underline}

#### [Saudi military budget unsustainable -- leads to a collapse of capabilities and domestic stability.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia must deal with]{.underline} seven critical [external
security objectives]{.underline} in the process [if it is to bring
security costs down to the proper levels]{.underline}:

Find [affordable ways to deter and contain Iran]{.underline}, both in a
narrow military sense and in terms of its regional impact of influence.

Find [affordable way to end its war in Yemen]{.underline}--- choosing
containment over victory if necessary.

Find a [workable compromise with Qatar, do what it can to revise the
G]{.underline}ulf [C]{.underline}ooperation [C]{.underline}ouncil [and
give it the meaningful level of integration and interoperability it has
lacked since its founding]{.underline}. This means building on its de
facto present military alliance with the UAE, improving relations with
Oman, pushing for reform in Bahrain, and integrating key aspects of air,
missile, and maritime defense with Kuwait and other Gulf states.

[Giving Iraq strong incentives to join other Arab states in creating a
Gulf security structure]{.underline} and to limit Iranian
influence---rather than standing largely aside and assuming that Iran
has already won.

[Making Jordan a full security partner]{.underline}; doing what it can
to support the Lebanese central government and armed forces to
counterbalance the Hezbollah, and isolate the Assad regime in Syria.

[Focus on providing the resources for]{.underline} three [critical
weaknesses in its current security forces]{.underline}: theater missile
defense, naval and air forces better designed to check Iran's asymmetric
threat, and border defenses and security barriers to guard its border
with Yemen.

[Creating a de facto joint force planning, exercise, and contingency
capability with the United States as its primary external security
guarantor to develop a common mix of security forces]{.underline} that
are both fully interoperable and affordable, that contain Iran and can
counter the extremist threat, and provide for the option of extended
deterrence in the JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran should fail.

There is no royal road to achieving any of these objectives. [These
objectives require major changes over a period of years to bring Saudi
spending down to the proper levels, as well as leadership at the highest
levels of government and the royal family who recognize this need. It
also means that key strategic partners like the U.S. must act in ways
that recognize that **Saudi overspending on security threatens Saudi
domestic stability**.]{.underline} Both Saudi Arabia leaders and those
of its partners need to realize that [Saudi civil stability and
development is the core priority, not building up Saudi military forces
or using Saudi Arabia as a cash cow for arms buys, fund aid, or meeting
other security objectives.]{.underline}

### AT: Iran DA

#### US arm sales only strengthen Iranian influence in Yemen and the rest of the Middle East.

Daniel **Byman 18** {Senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy
at Brookings, "How the U.S. Is Empowering Iran in Yemen,"
*ForeignAffairs*,

Yet such [warnings of the Iranian threat miss a key factor: the United
States' own policies have at times advanced rather than hindered
Tehran's regional ambitions. **Nowhere is this clearer than in
Yemen**]{.underline}. [U.S. support for]{.underline} a brutal
[Saudi]{.underline}-led military campaign in the country [has created a
humanitarian crisis of staggering proportions, while **offering an
opening** for Iran to expand its influence in the country.]{.underline}
Military intervention has made insurgents more reliant on support from
Tehran and is turning civilians against U.S. partners. [If Washington
wants to counter Iranian influence, **it needs to reverse
course**---ending its disastrous support for the Saudi-led coalition and
throwing its weight behind peace talks. Doubling down on the military
effort will serve only to further Iran's regional
ascendance.]{.underline}

The roots of the current conflict in Yemen trace back to the early
2000s, when Houthi rebels from the northern region of Saada repeatedly
rebelled against the regime of then resident Ali Abdullah Saleh, hoping
to increase their share of state patronage. Arab Spring protests in 2011
forced Saleh to step down and hand power to his second-in-command, Abd
Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Behind the scenes, however, Saleh schemed with loyal
military forces to retain his influence. Taking advantage of the ensuing
chaos, Houthi rebels conquered the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. By the
following year, they controlled much of Yemen. Fighting against the
Houthis---and among each other---were supporters of Hadi's government, a
local al Qaeda branch, southern separatists, and a collective of local
actors.

[Blithely ignoring this complexity, Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [and the
U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates [entered
the war]{.underline} in March 2015, seeking [to put Hadi back in power
and fight]{.underline} the Houthis, whom they saw as [a proxy of their
archenemy]{.underline}, Iran. Saudi and Emirati leaders feared that,
through the Houthis, Iran would gain a foothold in Yemen much as it had
done in Lebanon, where Tehran has a powerful proto-state ally in the
form of Hezbollah. Saudi leaders predicted that the intervention would
quickly tip the scales and that the civil war would end after only a few
weeks.

Three years later, [what was supposed to be a short, decisive
intervention has ground on, with no end in sight]{.underline}. The
campaign has reclaimed parts of southern Yemen from the Houthis. But the
insurgents have kept control over the capital, Sanaa, and still boast
tens of thousands of armed fighters.

[There has been good reason for]{.underline} policymakers in Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, and [Washington to worry about Iranian ascendance
across the region]{.underline}. Tehran's closest ally, Syrian dictator
Bashar al-[Assad, has made steady headway against insurgent groups,
including forces backed by the United States and its
allies]{.underline}. In May, elections in Iraq and Lebanon boosted the
influence of Iranian-backed groups, while the United States' and the
Saudis' favored candidates suffered setbacks. An Iranian member of
parliament has famously boasted that his country controls "four Arab
capitals"---Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus, and now Sanaa.

Yet it's easy to overstate Iran's hold on the region overall---and on
Yemen in particular. In reality, [**the Houthis and Iran are allies of
convenience** against the U.S.-backed Saudi military
campaign]{.underline}. Although the Houthis are commonly referred to as
Shiites, their faith more closely resembles Sunnism than Shiism as
practiced in Iran. Unlike the Lebanese Hezbollah, they do not profess
loyalty to Iran's Supreme Leader. [The Persian-Arab divide, the Houthis'
focus on accessing state patronage in Yemen, and a strong sense of
Yemeni independence also complicate the idea that the Houthis are
Tehran's proxies.]{.underline}

But [because of the]{.underline} Saudi-led [campaign]{.underline} meant
to push back on Iran, **[Tehran now has an opening in Yemen it might
otherwise not have had]{.underline}**. Iran gives the Houthis arms,
including short-range ballistic missiles, and in exchange the Houthis
have offered it an entry into a part of the world where its influence
had once been limited. Houthis have threatened ships off the Yemeni
coast with Iranian missiles, even hitting a Turkish ship delivering
humanitarian aid. And their slogans, speeches, and media strategy
increasingly echo those of Hezbollah, lending some support to Saudi
fears that the group may be turning into a Yemeni version of Iran's
Lebanese proxy. In addition, Shiites in other countries are embracing
the Houthi cause as part of what they see as a larger struggle against
Sunni hegemony.

#### It's reverse causal: ending support stabilizes the region, including ISIS, and emboldens Iran.

Daniel **Byman 18** {Senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy
at Brookings, "How the U.S. Is Empowering Iran in Yemen,"
*ForeignAffairs*,

[Washington should end its casual support for its allies' ill-fated and
destructive efforts. **Doing so is in its own strategic interest**: Iran
is stronger in Yemen than it was at the outset of the Saudi-led
intervention]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab
[E]{.underline}mirates [and Saudi Arabia have spent tens of
billions]{.underline} on the war, [and many Yemeni hate them for the
destruction they have brought]{.underline}. Even with a Houthi defeat in
Hodeidah, the war will likely drag on.

Moreover, the United States' yellow light does not absolve it from its
complicity in the humanitarian disaster gripping Yemen. Although the
Trump administration has done little to suggest that it cares about
humanitarian crises, especially in the Middle East, its logistical and
intelligence support for the intervention ties it directly to the
Yemenis' suffering. This is true even though leaders claim that the
United States is not at war and few U.S. citizens know of their
country's role in the conflict. As Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) has noted,
"It stretches the imagination, and it stretches the English language
beyond its breaking point, to suggest the U.S. military is not engaged
in hostilities in Yemen."

[Ironically, Trump may need the goodwill of the Saudis and Emiratis much
less than his predecessor]{.underline} did. [Both allies support the
U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, but the campaign's success has largely
driven the caliphate underground]{.underline} in Iraq and Syria.
Notionally, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates also play a role in
Trump's Arab-Israeli peace plans, but given that these are deeply
unrealistic and unformed, this is of little relevance. [Even within
Yemen, the United States has tremendous leverage over its allies---it
just won't use it.]{.underline} As researcher and aid expert Alex De
Waal argues, the in-flight refueling, presence of U.S. advisers, and
[arms sales]{.underline} all [offer tools for the United States to exert
pressure on its allies.]{.underline}

Although the Trump administration is unlikely to seize it, the UAE's
current assault on the strategic, Houthi-held port of Hodeidah offers an
opportunity to renew negotiations. [The United States should support the
ongoing efforts]{.underline} of Martin Griffiths, the UN's new envoy to
Yemen, [to halt the offensive and conduct peace talks. Congress could
encourage such efforts, **using its influence over the approval of arms
sales** and control over U.S. military spending to push the
administration. Hearings on growing Iranian influence and the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen that involve public criticism of
publicity-sensitive allies such as Saudi Arabia also can shift the
debate.]{.underline} An attack on Hodeidah by the Saudi-UAE coalition
forces is likely to be costly to both sides, but a defeat would be
particularly devastating for the Houthis, who would lose a supply port
as well as a visible symbol of their military might. To prevent such an
outcome, the Houthis could be encouraged to enter a deal on the
condition of reducing ties to Tehran. In the absence of such a deal,
however, they are likely to double down on Iran's support, which would
become their primary lifeline. U.S. allies, for their part, can claim
victory in Hodeidah and enter negotiations with a "win," allowing them
to at least reduce the scale of their interventions. That won't solve

//JTR

President Trump came into office criticizing the U.S. wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq and promised he would try to avoid foreign military
engagements. [Yet this month the [White House]{.mark} has been [talking
as if conflict with Iran is]{.mark} suddenly [on the
table. ]{.mark}]{.underline}[Trump tweeted]{.mark}[ over the weekend,
\"[If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of
Iran.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

But it\'s not clear if U.S. officials have evidence that Iran \"wants to
fight\" or why the Pentagon has dispatched additional ships and bombers
to the Middle East.

[National security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo have been especially aggressive in their Iran
rhetoric.]{.underline}

Pompeo and other top officials briefed members of the House and Senate
in private on Tuesday. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told
reporters that the U.S. warnings and deployments have already made Iran
think twice about starting anything. \"This is about deterrence, not
about war,\" Shanahan said.

[But [Iranian Foreign Minister]{.mark} Mohammad Javad
Zarif ]{.underline}[told]{.mark} CNN[ [the U.S. is \"playing a very,
very dangerous game]{.mark}\" by placing more military assets in the
region.]{.underline}

[Wednesday night, two U.S. officials told NPR\'s Tom Bowman the [White
House]{.mark} is [considering]{.mark} a further [deployment of]{.mark}
about [5,000 military personnel to the region]{.mark}. This would
[include]{.mark} Patriot [missile batteries designed]{.mark} to shoot
down incoming missiles, plus [aircraft and warships]{.mark}. The
officials stressed the deployment, if approved, would be \"defensive in
nature.\"]{.underline}

Here\'s a look at how the talk has turned so bellicose and the risks
involved.

**What changed between the U.S. and Iran?**

[The first Sunday night in May, the White House ]{.underline}issued a
statement[ from Bolton, saying the U.S. has seen \"a number of troubling
and escalatory indications and warnings\" tied to the Iranian regime
threatening U.S. and allied interests. Bolton said the [U.S.]{.mark} was
[sending]{.mark} an [aircraft carrier strike group and land-based
bombers to]{.mark} the [Persian Gulf]{.mark} in response.]{.underline}

Later, administration sources said intelligence photos showed Iran had
loaded missiles onto small boats run by Iran\'s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps, which the U.S. last month declared a terrorist
organization. But then the Iranian forces reportedly unloaded some. U.S.
allies in the Gulf last week said oil tankers suffered damage from
sabotage attributed to Iran. Iran has denied plans to attack U.S.
interests but said it is prepared to defend itself against the United
States.

**Iran and the U.S. have been adversaries for decades. Why is this
happening now?**

The Trump administration is trying to pressure and isolate Iran. A year
ago, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by pulling out of the Obama-era
agreement to limit Iran\'s nuclear program. That was a deal between Iran
and world powers to ease economic sanctions in return for Iran putting
limits on its nuclear program. Trump says it\'s not tough enough. Since
pulling out, the U.S. has been pushing hard for countries to stop doing
business with Iran in the hopes it will change its behavior in the
region, like stop supporting militias in Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere
and stop developing missiles. Pompeo says Iran needs to act \"like a
normal country.\" One of the U.S. officials raising alarms about Iran
threats is Bolton, who joined the administration as national security
adviser a year ago and has in the past supported forcing a regime change
in Iran. But administration officials insist the goal now is only to
change the regime\'s behavior. That would include, officials say,
renegotiating the nuclear deal. Iran rejects the idea of reopening the
deal.

**Why are other countries resisting the U.S. push?**

[First, the [Trump]{.mark} administration has [split from other world
powers]{.mark} on the nuclear deal. The U.S. is the only signatory to
pull out,]{.underline} while others --- Britain, France, Germany,
Russia, China, the European Union --- say the agreement is working to
keep Iran from getting close to building nuclear weapons. They\'re
working to keep it going, even though companies in those countries could
get cut off from business with the U.S. if they do business with Iran.
China, Iran\'s biggest oil buyer, has tried to continue importing
Iranian crude.

[As the U.S. increases pressure and warns of military action, European
leaders seem to ]{.underline}be getting more worried.[ They [fear
Iran]{.mark} [will]{.mark} just decide that since it\'s not getting the
sanctions relief and economic benefits promised under the nuclear deal,
it will just ]{.underline}[resume its previous nuclear
activities]{.mark}. Iran has threatened it could do so next month if
Europe doesn\'t save the deal.

Europeans remember misleading U.S. warnings about the threat of Iraqi
weapons before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

**How real is the risk of war?**

Both Iran and the United States are on the record denying they want a
war and it\'s hard to see how it would be popular in either country.
[But [the military situation]{.mark} in the Middle East [is inherently
unstable]{.mark}, and there are [multiple potential flashpoints]{.mark}.
U.S. and Iranian military forces are in close proximity across the
region. [There\'s a risk of miscalculation or acciden]{.mark}t. U.S. and
Iranian boats crisscross in the Persian Gulf, where Iran
captured ]{.underline}some U.S. sailors in 2016[. Iranian officials have
threatened to ]{.underline}block the narrow Strait of Hormuz[.
Pro-Iranian militias move in the same cities in Iraq as U.S. troops and
have attacked them in the past. They\'re also close to each other in
Syria. [The U.S. has major military bases in Qatar and Bahrain]{.mark},
just across the Gulf from Iran. [Some of Iran\'s hard-liners might
welcome a conflict with the U.S.]{.mark} because it would undermine
moderate Iranians who want to engage with the West. And [a small
conflict could grow]{.mark}. Iran could engage in underground attacks
around the region or outside it. Israel or Saudi Arabia might take the
opportunity to attack their big regional rival.]{.underline}

### AT: Defense Base DA

#### **Cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia wouldn't cause considerable job loss and econ damage, and wouldn't be a national security threat** 

**Caverley 18** (Jonathan D., 10/12/18, associate professor at the
United States Naval War College and a research scientist at M.I.T.,
"Want to Punish Saudi Arabia? Cut Off Its Weapons Supply", The New York,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)>

[Despite recent increases, Saudi arms orders remain a manageably small
part of the United States' exports.]{.underline} According to the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, [in 2017]{.underline}, a
near-record year for annual purchases, [the United State]{.underline}s
delivered \$5.5 billion worth of arms, [20 percent of all foreign
military sales. That may sound like a lot, but the United States exports
only 25 to 30 percent of its defense industry production, so exports to
Saudi Arabia clearly remain a relatively small slice of the]{.underline}
enormous defense industrial [pie.]{.underline}

And contrary to President Trump's statement, exports to Saudi Arabia
create relatively few American jobs. [Based on Commerce Department
figures, releasing the billion dollars of munitions currently on hold in
the Senate would "create or sustain" fewer than 4,000 jobs. Here's a
more specific example: Publicizing a recent \$6 billion helicopter deal
with Saudi Arabia, Lockheed Martin predicted that it would "support" 450
American jobs.]{.underline}

[To date these sales have not "stewarded our national
security."]{.underline} Beyond its tragic war in Yemen, [Saudi Arabia
has blockaded Qatar]{.underline}, an ally that hosts the Middle East's
largest American military base. And [Saudi Arabia provides little help
when it comes to Washington's real regional priorities, such as fighting
the Islamic State and stabilizing Iraq.]{.underline} The Pentagon's
National Defense Strategy specifically de-emphasizes the war on terror
to focus on competition with China and Russia.

#### Econ benefits of arms sales over exaggerated 

**Thrall and Cohen 19** (A. Trevor, senior fellow for the Cato's
Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department, an associate
professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and
Government, and Jordan, a Ph.D. student in political science at George
Mason University, "The False Promises of Trump's Arms Sales", 4/5/19,
Cato Institute,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales)>

Finally, Trump's [claims about the economic benefits of arms sales ring
the hollowest of all.]{.underline} For starters, not only won't arms
sales create a million new American jobs, but [a great number of the
jobs created by arms sales will go to citizens of the purchasing
nations.]{.underline} As the Security Assistance Monitor report notes,
the number of licenses granted to weapons manufacturers outside the
United States doubled from 2017 to 2018. [As a result, more than
one-quarter of all U.S. arms "sales" last year were deals to permit the
manufacturing of U.S.-designed weapons under license --- that is, they
created jobs in other nations instead of the United States. The report
also finds that the Trump administration has sharply increased the
number of deals in which foreign countries produce U.S.-developed
weaponry under coproduction agreement]{.underline}s, further reducing
the number of U.S. jobs tied to arms sales.

[Weakening the economic rationale]{.underline} even further [is the fact
that]{.underline} in order to seal major deals, [American defense
contractors have to offer massive discounts, or offsets, to the
purchasing nations in the form of coproduction arrangements or
technology transfer. In 2014, for example, these offsets equaled roughly
one-third of the value of total U.S. arms sales. These offsets mean not
only that American arms sales are less profitable than they appear on
paper, but also that they lead to fewer jobs created in the United
States than many, including the president, would like to
think.]{.underline} Trump's big Saudi arms deal, for example, would
likely lead to somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs, or less than
two-tenths of one percent of the American labor market.

[The unpleasant truth is that the underwhelming economic benefits cannot
justify Washington's love of arms sales.]{.underline} Arms sales simply
do not benefit the U.S. economy nearly as much as Trump likes to claim.
Meanwhile, a large percentage of American arms sales goes to countries
with horrible human rights records, to nations where arms are at risk of
finding their way into the wrong hands, and to nations embroiled in
dangerous and destabilizing conflicts. Given this, it is long past time
to rethink American arms sales policy.

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia small value of total exported goods 

**Wezeman 18** (Pieter D., Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms
Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme, 12/14/18, "Saudi Arabia,
armaments and conflict in the Middle East", SIPRI,
<https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2018/saudi-arabia-armaments-and-conflict-middle-east)>

This diversification is likely to be driven by efforts to improve its
bargaining position on the arms market, to widen and deepen its
international political network and in order to minimize the effects of
the restrictive arms export policies of current supplier states on Saudi
Arabian arms procurement. The latter has been of increased relevance as
[a number of European states critical of Saudi Arabia's use of military
force in Yemen successively announced severe restrictions on arms
exports to the Kingdom.]{.underline} The Netherlands led the way in
early 2016 and by late 2018 Germany, Finland and Denmark had followed.
However, the main European arms exporters to Saudi Arabia ---such as the
UK, France, Spain and Italy---have discussed such restrictions but not
implemented them.

[Similar discussions about restricting arms sales to Saudi Arabia have
been ongoing in the USA. However, the administration of US President
Donald J. Trump decided not to go down this path, arguing that arms
supplies are important for sustaining]{.underline} relations between the
USA and Saudi Arabia; the US Administration sees Saudi Arabia as playing
a crucial role in maintaining security in the Middle East as a bulwark
against terrorism and as a key player in countering Iranian influence.
In addition[, Trump has argued that arms sales to Saudi Arabia are a
major source of export revenue and involve a significant number of jobs.
Whereas the security-related arguments are difficult to quantify, the
economic arguments have been heavily criticized as inflated. For
example, according to US Government sources the value of deliveries of
military goods and services to Saudi Arabia peaked in 2017 at \$6.2
billion, or 0.27 per cent of total goods and services exported by the
USA in 2017.]{.underline}

Embargoes Against Uncooperative Partners,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-arms-embargoes-against-uncooperative-partners/

The [efficacy of withholding military assistance, including grant aid
and arms sales, to modify the behavior of recipient countries is a hotly
debated topic in the U.S. foreign policy community]{.underline}. Last
month, War on the Rocks published another contribution to this
discussion. In "The Case Against Arms Embargos, Even for Saudi Arabia,"
Raymond Rounds opposes what he calls an "arms embargo" on Saudi Arabia,
arguing that suspending U.S. arms sales as leverage over policy
disagreements will only backfire by driving the kingdom to purchase arms
from other countries. He contends that suspending sales to Saudi Arabia
will fail to alter objectionable Saudi conduct, whether in Yemen or
domestically, while "\[damaging\] ties with Saudi Arabia." According to
Rounds, this dynamic is not unique to Saudi Arabia, but a general
proposition that applies to all U.S. arms recipients.

[If he is correct, arms embargoes ---]{.underline} a regular tool of
U.S. foreign policy [--- are quixotic attempts to shape the behavior of
foreign governments and put the United States at a strategic
disadvantage to global competitors.]{.underline} While [this
argument]{.underline} seems reasonable, if depressing, it [suffers from
two principal and serious flaws.]{.underline}

First, the [empirical record does not support Rounds' contention that
arms embargoes do not deliver]{.underline}. While these suspensions are
not a silver bullet, there is [ample evidence to demonstrate that they
can be effective in changing the policy of a target
country]{.underline}. For example, in 2005, the [United States
successfully used the suspension of a joint weapons project to persuade
Israel to cancel a proposed sale of drone equipment to
China]{.underline}. In another example, then-Secretary of State [Rex
Tillerson secured commitments from Egypt to resolve a longstanding
criminal case against 41 foreign NGO workers, including Americans and
Europeans, and to suspend military cooperation with North Korea in
exchange for releasing \$195 million in suspended military
aid]{.underline}. More recently, the legislative hold Sen. Robert
[Menendez placed on an arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, when combined with threatened legislation to impose further
restrictions on transfers to Saudi Arabia, helped pressure the Saudi-led
coalition in Yemen to re-engage in negotiations with the Houthis,
resulting in an imperfect but still important deal on the port of
Hodeidah.]{.underline}

The [author's argument that arms embargoes do not work cites the 2013
suspension of U.S. military aid to Egypt]{.underline} following that
country's military coup. This policy clearly failed to reverse the
military coup led by current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, [but there
are good reasons to question the validity of the example]{.underline}.
Proponents of the suspension argue with good reason that [it was not
given a fair chance to work]{.underline}. [Shortly after the decision
was announced, senior U.S. officials told the Egyptians the aid would
soon be restored, undercutting the coercive value of the
suspension.]{.underline} From the perspective of the [Egyptian
government, it would have been irrational to make serious concessions in
response to what they believed was an idle threat.]{.underline} Just as
important, due to a plethora of exceptions and carve-outs, [some U.S.
military assistance to Egypt continued throughout the suspension period,
including maintenance and sustainment, sparing the Egyptian military
from the full force of the hold]{.underline}.

[Despite undercutting its own suspension, the hold still produced some
good]{.underline}. U.S. [diplomats were able to leverage the policy to
deter the Egyptian government from enforcing an arbitrary September 2014
deadline for NGOs to register under Egypt's draconian 2002 NGO
law]{.underline}. And, although Egypt released U.S. citizen Mohamed
Soltan from prison two months after aid was resumed, [Cairo was partly
motivated by the concern that the Obama administration could reverse its
decision to resume arms shipments.]{.underline} To be sure, these
accomplishments were relatively limited, and we should be careful not to
overestimate the efficacy of arms holds. A foreign government is
unlikely to fundamentally change its position on what it views as an
existential issue. But [prior suspensions have yielded tangible gains,
and they should remain part of the U.S. foreign policy
toolkit.]{.underline}

Second, [Rounds also overstates the costs of suspending arms
transfers]{.underline}. He is [particularly focused on the potential for
losing "access,"]{.underline} a term that encompasses relationships with
the recipient country's military leadership; insight into their views,
organization, and doctrine; and permission for the U.S. military to use
that country's bases and airspace. These are legitimate concerns, but
[suspensions do not automatically compromise access]{.underline}.
[Egypt]{.underline}, for instance, [never curtailed the U.S. military
ability to use the Suez Canal or Egyptian airspace while arms transfers
were on hold]{.underline}. And, while intelligence about a foreign
military is valuable, we often have other, clandestine ways to acquire
such information. Moreover, we should not conflate access with
influence. U.S. military officials had access to their Egyptian
counterparts during the events of 2013, but those channels were of no
use in deterring Egypt's military from removing the country's
democratically elected president. [Nor has U.S access reduced civilian
casualties from Saudi-coalition bombing in Yemen. In these cases, access
without influence does not absolve the United States of
complicity.]{.underline}

The author's other major concern is that arms suspensions could result
in the loss of arms sales to strategic competitors like Russia or China.
The jobs created by such sales are not trivial matters, but [studies
have found that they do not provide the economic benefits or jobs that
are often touted]{.underline}. [Nor are these sales necessary to
maintain the military industrial base, which is powered by billions of
dollars each year from domestic purchases, except in rare
cases.]{.underline} [Fundamentally, the author's implicit
argument]{.underline} --- that if the United States reliably supplies
weapons to strategically important countries, they won't seek them
elsewhere --- [is suspect]{.underline}. Countries, including close
partners like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, have long sought to
diversify their weapons stockpiles, and in an increasingly multipolar
world, more countries are seeking to diversify their arms suppliers to
maintain their own independence. While U.S. arms will continue to
compete with Russian or Chinese counterparts on a sale-by-sale basis, it
will [become increasingly unrealistic to be the exclusive supplier of
any partner country, irrespective of how reliable the United States
is.]{.underline}

[The reluctance to use the leverage afforded by arms transfers is
symptomatic of a broader pathology in U.S. foreign policy: a fixation on
maintaining relationships without regard to the value they
provide]{.underline}. Relationships are important, but the [United
States should receive a commensurate return on its
investments.]{.underline} When this is not the case, the [United States
should not hesitate to adjust the status and intimacy of a bilateral
relationship, including through the suspension of arms
transfers]{.underline}. Contrary to Rounds' argument, [such steps can
yield important policy gains]{.underline}. Even if they do not, [we can
at least avoid some of the blowback of enabling reckless and
rights-abusing actions. Distance does not have the allure of access, but
it may ultimately put the United States in a stronger strategic
position]{.underline}.

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia rely on the myth of securitization -- they uphold killing machines on the premise of war profiteering.

Patrick T. **Hiller 17** {Member of the Governing Council of the
International Peace Research Association and director of the War
Prevention Initiative of the Jubitz Family Foundation, "The \$110
Billion Myth of Supporting Saudi Arabia's Defense Needs," *World Beyond
War*,
<https://worldbeyondwar.org/110-billion-myth-supporting-saudi-arabias-defense-needs/>,
Published 5/20/17, Accessed 6/19/19} //RG

A May 20, 2017 press release "Supporting Saudi Arabia's Defense Needs"
from the U.S. State Department outlines the framework. [How \$110
billion worth of killing machinery such as tanks, artillery,
helicopters, combatant ships, and other weapons systems reflect the
State Department's slogan "Diplomacy in Action" is a mythological
stretch of imagination]{.underline}. More importantly though, this deal
is [the continuation of global arms trade practices]{.underline} that
[are sustained by several myths which are driven by a militarist
consensus and acceptance of war profiteering]{.underline} regardless of
who is President. With the help of historian Paul Holden and colleagues'
2016 book Indefensible: Seven myths that sustain the global arms trade,
it is now possible to shed new light on what we are led to believe such
deals achieve.

[The myth of increased security]{.underline}: According to the State
Department, this deal supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia in
the face of malign Iranian influence and threats. That's unlikely, given
that [Holden and colleagues demonstrated that increased weapons spending
leads to arms races, increases security threats due to ill-conceived
usage, and under-sources important non-military action. Looking at the
bloodshed in the region, we now can say with certainty that the
continued influx of weapons makes civilians caught in violent conflict
less secure.]{.underline}

The myth of a sound national security analysis: [More weapons provided
by the United States into a volatile region will not only add fuel to
the many regional fires, it will also undermine successful diplomatic
initiatives such as the Iran Nuclear Deal]{.underline}. [It is more
likely that such deals are driven by economic considerations -- that is,
corporate profits or flat out corruption]{.underline}. In fact, the
State Department does not hide the fact that this deal presumably
expands opportunities for American companies in the region.

The myth of controlling how the weapons are used: [Backed by the U.S.,
Saudi Arabia is fighting a war in Yemen, which, according to the United
Nations humanitarian affairs office is "experiencing the world's largest
humanitarian crisis."]{.underline} In other words, [this arms deal will
lead to continued killing of Yemeni people by U.S. weapons of
war]{.underline}. Women. Children. Civilians.

Administration [officials are well aware of how these weapons are
used]{.underline}, even though Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis called
for UN brokered negotiations of the conflict. This was just a month
before [the]{.underline} \$110 billion [arms deal with Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, which [is being sold to the public in a sterile
narrative of bolstering the security of our allies with U.S.
weapons.]{.underline} Of course, we must not dismiss the fact that
authoritarian [regimes like Saudi Arabia have been known to use weaponry
against their own citizens to crush any form of dissent.]{.underline}

The myth that corruption only exists in developing countries: [The
current administration's officials and advisors demonstrate
unprecedented levels of ethically questionable connections between their
roles as public servants and the many business and consulting entities
they belong or belonged to]{.underline}. Some of the more reserved
voices talk about kleptocracy, others go straight to [the "Banana
Republic" analogy]{.underline}. This, [together with an already existing
arms trade context where blanket secrecy is accepted under the national
security disguise, is extremely worrisome.]{.underline}

Some might ask: But what about the seven-decade long security relations
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia? What about our steadfast ally in the
region? [Despite its "imperfections," don't we need Saudi Arabia to keep
the evil Iranians at bay and rid the world of evil Islamic terrorists?

[Cases of genocide, like that in Yemen,]{.underline} then, [are hidden
behind a conceptual veil.]{.underline} They do not conform to the
limited conception of genocide that continues to dominate genocide
studies; therefore, [they remain at the periphery]{.underline} of the
field, if not invisible altogether. [However, a holistic conception of
genocide]{.underline} that incorporates Lemkin's three methods of
genocide, and the eight techniques from which they were derived,
[reveals the processes by which the very foundations of group life, both
material and non-material, can be destroyed.]{.underline}

[When applied to the Coalition, a holistic concept also reveals the
ongoing genocide in Yemen. The Coalition has deliberately attacked
civilians in their homes, markets and mosques, and while attending
weddings and funerals]{.underline}. The Coalition has [intentionally
destroyed Yemen's vital civilian infrastructure and cultural heritage,
attacked its hospitals, and imposed an air and naval blockade of Yemeni
ports]{.underline}. It has [undermined public health in Yemen, causing
tens of thousands of preventable deaths]{.underline}. Even as this was
being written, the Coalition was engaged in [assaults on Hudeida and
Saada]{.underline}. In Hudeida, at least 55 people were killed and 170
injured [when densely populated districts of the port city were
attacked]{.underline} on 2 August 2018, [including the]{.underline}
areas around [Al-Thawra Hospital]{.underline}.95 One week later, on 9
August, [a school bus transporting children home]{.underline} to Saada
from a field trip [was bombed]{.underline} (using a US-manufactured and
-sold MK-82 bomb),96 killing at least 54 people, including 44
children.97 There are also warnings of a second impending
[cholera]{.underline} epidemic, along with '8.4 million Yemenis who are
a step away from [famine']{.underline}.98

[The Coalition's actions in Yemen amount to nothing less than a
**synchronised attack on all aspects of life in Yemen**]{.underline},
the very foundation of Lemkin's concept of genocide. Wi[thout the
uninterrupted flow of aid and support from the US and UK, the Coalition
would not be capable of committing genocide on the scale that it has
achieved. The provision of military equipment and weapons, along with
the mid-air refueling, targeting advice and support, sharing of
intelligence, and expedited munitions resupply and maintenance have made
it possible. The US]{.underline} and UK [have provided this aid and
support with full knowledge of its consequences]{.underline}. The very
fact that [the US has increased its targeting assistance in response to
criticism of the Coalition's attacks on civilians]{.underline} is
evidence of knowledge of the harm being perpetrated. Therefore, it is
incontrovertible that [the US]{.underline} and UK [share responsibility
with the Coalition for genocide in Yemen]{.underline}.

### \-\--Complicity 

#### Complicity makes the US responsible for violence committed as a result of its arms deals.

**[Complicity in the commission of an internationally wrongful act
is]{.underline}** typically **[described as]{.underline}** a form of
**[ancillary]{.underline}**, derivative or indirect
**[responsibility]{.underline}**. 28 While there may be nuanced
differences between these adjectives, they all base the responsibility
for complicity upon the actual commission of the principal wrongful act.
At a technical level, it is easy to understand why complicity is
derivative, as **[the responsibility for the accomplice arises after the
commission of the wrongful act by the principal]{.underline}**. However,
the qualification of responsibility for complicity as ancillary,
derivative or indirect may be regarded as undermining the sanctity of an
international obligation, and the legal system as a whole. First, the
qualification of responsibility for complicity as derivative diminishes
the reprimand associated with it. However, **[as a matter of principle,
there is nothing less reprehensible of complicity than of the principal
wrongdoing it occasions.]{.underline}**

Second, this qualification fosters the idea of responsibility as a
purely remedial mechanism, dependent on the commission of the principal
wrongful act, and allowing for the responsibility of the accomplice to
be a mere afterthought. Third, while complicity is indeed derivative at
the level of the origins of responsibility (ie triggering or fait
générateur), it would be misleading to qualify the content of
responsibility for complicity (ie the legal consequences) as derivative.
This may result in an undue burden of reparation on weaker principal
actors and the provision of a safe haven for stronger complicit actors.
**[Complicity in the internationally wrongful act should rather be
conceived of as a form of shared responsibility,]{.underline}**
involving a factual relationship of at least two conducts and three
actors. 29 The advantage of framing complicity as a form of shared
responsibility is to avoid the diminished reprimand attached to
complicit conduct vis- à -vis the principal wrongful act. Moreover, the
theoretical construction of complicity as a form of shared
responsibility permits a more balanced approach to the allocation of
responsibility between the accomplice and the principal. It also
enhances the prospects for the injured State or international
organisation to seek reparation from both the principal and the
accomplice. More generally, responsibility for complicity is a
conceptually rare and complex object of analysis for a host of reasons.
First, responsibility for complicity contains elements of primary and
secondary norms, appearing as a structural or meta-rule in the legal
order. 30 Second, complicity puts into question the objective character
of responsibility through its cognitive requirement. Third, it raises
complex issues regarding the nature of obligations in international law,
and the legal interests of the international community in their
observance. **[The phenomenon of complicity in a wrongful act makes it
'more essential than ever that the rules developed to ensure the ordered
progress of relations between its members should be constantly and
scrupulously respected]{.underline}**'

#### The result is massive atrocities exacerbating in Yemen --- with the blood on American hands.

**[Yemen illustrates how arms sales can make a conflict
worse]{.underline}**. In 2015, the Obama administration made the
decision to provide support to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen's
civil war. The **[Saudis, backed by U.S.]{.underline}** logistical aid,
**[arms sales,]{.underline}** and intelligence support, **[have
conducted thousands of airstrikes against civilian targets including
hospitals, schools, and food production facilities]{.underline}** in
violation of the rules of war. **[The war has]{.underline}** also
**[generated]{.underline}** what United Nations agencies have called
**[the world's worst humanitarian crisis, displacing more than two
million Yemenis and killing more than 10,000.]{.underline}**

**[Instead of working to convince the Saudis to end their horrific
campaign, the administration has continued providing military support
and expanded arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite several members of
Congress raising grave concerns]{.underline}**. Weapons sold to Saudi
Arabia after the start of hostilities include \$500 million worth of
precision-guided munitions used in the kingdom's air campaign, along
with aircraft, helicopters, tanks, and armored vehicles. Not only does
this make the United States complicit in war crimes in Yemen, selling
major conventional weapons to states actively engaged in a conflict
prolong those conflicts.

[Few nations have large enough arsenals to fight conflicts for extended
periods of time without resupply]{.underline}. This is particularly true
of nations without large domestic defense industries that rely heavily
on arms imports to sustain combat operations. [Saudi Arabia was the
second-largest arms importer worldwide from 2013-17,]{.underline} and
increased its imports 225 percent over the previous five years, partly

## AT: Mid-East Scenario

### Saudi Deterrence Turn 

#### Arm sales are key not just in the context of Yemen but to maintain Middle East stability and Saudi deterrence cred -- laundry list of internal links -- energy dependence, interoperability, terrorism, WMD response (Saudi Patriots), Air Force, cooperation

Anthony H. **Cordesman 10** {Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, cited by Deborah Jerome
in "Is Big Saudi Arms Sales a Good Idea?: Expert Roundup," *Council on
Foreign Relations*,

Published 7/24/10, Accessed 6/19/19} //RG

[The United States shares critical strategic interests with Saudi Arabia
that shape the proposed Saudi arms sale]{.underline}. First, for all the
talk of energy independence over the last four decades, [the U.S.
Department of Energy estimates that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will be as strategically dependent on imported oil
through 2035 as it is today]{.underline}. These projections do not even
take account of our indirect imports of oil in the form of manufactured
goods, or our [dependence on the health of a global economy that
requires stable supply- and market-driven prices. The stability of Gulf
energy exports is critical to our economy and every job in the United
States.]{.underline}

Second, [U.S. military power is **finite**, and both the United States
and Saudi Arabia face rapidly changing threats. The United States needs
allies that have interoperable forces]{.underline} that can both fight
effectively alongside the United States and ease the U.S. burden by
defending themselves. [Iran already poses a massive asymmetric
naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf states.]{.underline} The U.S.
invasion of Iraq has left Iraqi forces a decade away from being a
counterbalance to Iran; **[Saudi Arabia is the only meaningful regional
power to work with]{.underline}**. Additionally, al-Qaeda in the
peninsula is based in Yemen, and [the threat of terrorism and outside
infiltration means highly mobile Saudi forces are critical to the
security of Saudi energy and civil facilities. Helping Saudi Arabia
create a combination of effective air and naval power also helps ensure
the security of tanker and other shipping in the Gulf of Oman and a
steadily more unstable Red Sea.]{.underline}

[Third, Iran already poses a missile and chemical weapons threat and may
pose a nuclear one within the next three to five years]{.underline}.
**[Upgrades of the Saudi Patriots create]{.underline}** a base for an
integrated approach to air and missile defense. [They lay the groundwork
for follow-on sales of advanced missile defense systems like THAAD, and
an emphasis on defense (not Saudi purchases of missiles or nuclear
systems).]{.underline} [Coupled with recent U.S. offers of \"extended
regional deterrence\" and the creation of a Saudi Air Force that is more
of a threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to Saudi
Arabia, they offer the best hope of]{.underline} both giving Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf states security and [stopping a nuclear arms race
in the region]{.underline}.

Fourth, [the]{.underline} proposed [arms sale]{.underline} package
[creates a level of interdependence that gives both the current Saudi
government as well as Saudi governments for the next fifteen to twenty
years a strong **incentive to work with the United
States**.]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia will need **continuing support**
from the United States during the entire lifecycle of every major system
sold]{.underline}, and no future Saudi government can ignore this fact.
Moreover, the sales are large in dollar terms, but not in terms of
numbers of weapons. This will not be some kind of massive build-up.
Saudi Arabia had an air force with some 417 combat aircraft in 2000, and
it now has only 219. The Saudi F-15 buy will not even restore the force
to 2000 numbers. It will take some three to five years to deliver and
put fully in service, replace some eighty-seven obsolete F-5A/Bs and
F-5EIIs that were in service in 2000, and help Saudi Arabia compensate
for the serious performance limits on 107 aging Tornados still in
service.

#### Even if the Saudi government is authoritarian, US support has historically been necessary for deterrence credibility against other [aggressive autocrats]{.underline}. The historical decision to hold our nose and swallow supporting the Saudis is more motivated by contingent considerations of the lesser evil and less by the Affirmative's theory of sort of coercive motivation.

During the last century, Saudi Arabia has become the largest and most
powerful state in the Southern Gulf. Saudi Arabia contains 259 billion
barrels of proven oil reserves, or one-quarter of the world\'s total.
The country is also the world\'s largest oil producer with output of
over 8 million barrels of oil per day, and is the world\'s largest
\"swing\" producer[. Saudi Arabia plays a critical role in ensuring
moderate and stable oil prices. It is the only Southern Gulf power
strong enough to serve as a strategic counterbalance to Iran and Iraq,
and is a critical partner in US collective security efforts in the
region.\']{.underline}

Like its neighbors, however, [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia faces many
challenges. It [cannot deter or defend itself from Iran and Iraq without
US military aid, and it must develop a stable basis for a lasting
strategic partnership with the US and other Western states.]{.underline}
It has not been able to catalyze effective collective security efforts
within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and it still faces problems in
eliminating its historical rivalries with other Southern Gulf states. It
must modernize its society without losing its Islamic and Arab
character, and it must restructure its economy to deal with declining
per capita oil wealth and the need to rely on native, rather than
foreign labor.

[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [should be able to meet these challenges, but
the task will be anything but easy. Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [faces
very real external threats from Iran and Iraq.]{.underline} Although
Saudi Arabia has made a serious effort to improve its relations with
Kuwait, Oman, and Yemen, change comes slowly in the Gulf. [Restructuring
Saudi society and the Saudi economy presents the most serious challenge
of all, and change must come at a time when Islamic extremism is a
serious concern and Saudi Arabia\'s oil income is not sufficient to meet
its social and economic needs.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia\'s strategic
partnership with the west involves inevitable differences in national
interest and culture, and its partnership with the US presents at least
short term problems in burden-sharing, counter-terrorism, and
prepositioning, and longer term problems in defining a stable and
equitable division of effort. [All of these challenges will require
constant attention during the coming decade.]{.underline}

[Lawmakers were fuming about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's move last
month to use an obscure emergency provision to advance the sales despite
congressional opposition]{.underline}. During the Wednesday hearing,
Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, pledged to use "every possible avenue" to block 22 arms sales
worth \$8.1 billion to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and, in
one instance, Jordan.

The fiery hearing marked the latest front in the battle between Capitol
Hill and the White House over the administration's repeated attempts to
use the powers of the executive branch to circumvent lawmakers on issues
including the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election
and Trump's long-promised border wall with Mexico.

[Engel and other Democrats on the committee accused the administration
of concocting a "phony emergency" to push through the arms
sales]{.underline} during a hearing on Wednesday with R. Clarke Cooper,
the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs. "There
is no emergency. It's phony. It's made up. And it's an abuse of the
law," Engel told Cooper.

Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized Saudi Arabia's
handling of the war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, where
thousands of civilians have died in part due to the Saudi-led coalition
airstrikes. They also cast doubt on Riyadh's reliability as an ally
after Saudi officials' alleged role in the murder of Khashoggi, a
Washington Post columnist, in the country's consulate in Istanbul last
year.

[Cooper defended Pompeo's decision to push through emergency arms sales
as a "one-time event" aimed at helping Gulf countries deter Iran. In
addition to backing Houthi rebels, Tehran has supported terrorist groups
across the Middle East. Last month, senior U.S. officials accused Tehran
of making "credible" threats against U.S. troops in Iraq. Cooper said it
was important for the administration to be "sending a message of
deterrence to Tehran ... sending a message to our partners, that we are
with them shoulder to shoulder."]{.underline}

### Deterrence -- TBMD Module

#### Arm sales key to Saudi Theater Ballistic Missile Defense.

In essence, [the role of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[in Saudi]{.underline} Arabia's [TBMD]{.underline} system [has been
significant]{.underline}, and the key reason has been the desire [to
make sure that the country is well protected]{.underline}. For instance,
[in 2014, Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [focused on upgrading the
Patriot]{.underline} Advanced Capability (PAC) 2 systems to the current
PAC-3 systems to boost its defense against TBMs. The United States
authorized the upgrade through the Department of Defense. [The upgrade
came in the form of a \$1.7 billion Raytheon contract]{.underline}
entailing a ground-system hardware and the support for equipment
upgrades.150

Following the 2015 Camp David Summit, [Saudi Arabia, along with other
Middle Eastern countries]{.underline} (including Qatar and Kuwait),
[renewed their efforts with the United States to develop an integrated
TBMD system. An integrated TBMD system would be an effective defense
mechanism because it uses radars, early warning, and a surface-to-air
missiles. Also, the United States favors the system as a regional
safeguard.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, which also possesses a stable economy, [also
faces significant TBM threats because the Arab giant enjoys close ties
with Western powers]{.underline}. According to Misher, Saudi Arabia
hosts one of the largest foreign army [bases]{.underline} of the United
States as well as facilitates for several [NATO operations]{.underline}
in the region.82 However, despite the numerous TBM threats that Saudi
Arabia is facing, [the country only possesses a small collection of BMD
systems]{.underline}, which it acquired as a result of its bilateral and
defense deal with China. [Moreover, the BDMs that Saudi Arabia has are
only capable of performing in a limited role]{.underline}, primarily
delivering conventional warheads. In 1987, Saudi Arabia acquired DF-3
missiles, and Misher observes that despite the massive inaccuracies
associated with the missile, it is capable of launching to a range of
2,500 km. 83 The Chinese also sold the DF21 missile to the Saudis in
2007, and it has a range of 1,700 km and uses stable fuel, which makes
it more useful and ready to launch than the DF-3.

[Meanwhile, the Saudi government's lack of a comprehensive and an
up-to-date TBMD means that it relies on the U.S. TBMD
system]{.underline}. The country has been a U.S. ally for decades, and
[it has several treaties and defense deals with the United States to
ensure the latter provides it with a comprehensive TBMD
system]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia also depends on the TBMD system
offered by the French and British defense departments to bolster both
its land and sea defense.84 Moreover, the Storm Shadow is a land attack
cruise missile jointly provided to Saudi Arabia by Britain and France
and can counter TBMs up to 3,000 km range.

[Prominent missile threats to Saudi Arabia are from Iran and
Syria]{.underline}, which also pose a wider threat to the region.
Gormley identifies Syria and Iran as [countries posing a threat and
contributing to the Middle East instability through their continued
development and acquisitions of TBMs]{.underline}---with assistance
mainly from Russia, North Korea, and China.85 It is widely believed that
[Syria has taken full advantage of its ongoing internal war and its
relationship with Russia to add on to its missile holdings.]{.underline}
Some of the TBMs that the nation has procured from China, North Korea,
and Russia include Scud-C missiles, which that have a range of 550 km;
Scud-B missiles, which that have a range of 300 km; and Scud-D,
missiles, which have a variety of 700 km. Moreover, Syria has also
acquired S-300 and S400 as Russian TBMDs.86 Already, Israel has used its
sophisticated defense missile when it used its Arrow-3 missile defense
system to intercept and destroy a TBM Syria had launched at it.

[Iran's TBM inventory includes the Shahab-3, which has a range of 1,000
km]{.underline}, and this makes it capable of reaching Israel, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, and other GCC countries within the same range87 Iran
also possesses various long-range missiles, like the Ghadr-1; however,
[it has recently]{.underline} halted the development of long-range TBMs
and [concentrated]{.underline} in lieu [on short and medium-range
missiles, which underlines its resolve to destabilize the Middle East
region]{.underline}.88 Misher shares that Iran possesses four
liquid-propellant and ballistic missile systems, which range between 300
km and 1,000 km; this highlights Iran's shift from producing long-range
missiles to short and medium-range TBMs.89 Misher further argues that
[Iran has long sought to undermine the GCC]{.underline} and establish
its own control along the Persian Gulf.90

### Turn -- Leverage 

#### Arms sales are holding together a fragile Saudi-US alliance -- the plan collapses the only factor for relations and prevents us from leveraging Saudi into more moderate positions. Palestine proves -- the US used the arms sales and Iran to push Saudi towards bringing Palestine to the negotiating table.

[Saudi Arabia is the top destination for U.S. arms, with U.S. defense
sales to the kingdom totaling close to \$90 billion since 1950,
according to the Pentagon.]{.underline} President Trump has encouraged
such deals, arguing that they create half a million American jobs;
several major defense firms have made lower projections. During his May
2017 trip to the kingdom, Trump signed a series of arms deals expected
to total some \$350 billion over a decade. [According to the arms
researcher SIPRI, Saudi Arabia's total arms imports were almost eighteen
times greater \[PDF\] in 2017 than they were a decade
earlier.]{.underline}

Divergence and Realignment: [U.S.-Saudi Arabia relations have never been
in complete harmony. Terrorism]{.underline} financing, the export of the
kingdom's interpretation of [Islam, human rights]{.underline} abuses,
and [the lack of democratic representation]{.underline}, as documented
annually by the State Department, have all caused friction.

[Although historically the United States and Saudi Arabia have had the
common objectives of regional stability and containing Iran, **they
differed on core issues**]{.underline} during the Obama administration.
Saudi Arabia was dismayed by the lack of U.S. support for ousted
Egyptian President Hosni [Mubarak]{.underline} and that it was not
included in initial negotiations on [Iran's nuclear
program]{.underline}, which were conducted in secret in Oman in 2013.
Saudi leadership also chafed at President Obama's vision that the
kingdom "share the neighborhood" with Iran.

The [Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a source of contention from
early days]{.underline}. During the second intifada (2000--2005), Riyadh
proposed the Arab Peace Initiative, under which Arab countries would
normalize relations with Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from the
occupied Palestinian territories and a "just solution" for Palestinian
refugees. Elements of the initiative were adopted by the Bush and Obama
administrations. [Many Arab states have criticized the Trump
administration's more outright support of Israel. The Saudi royal court
denounced the U.S. decision in 2018 to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's
capital]{.underline}. As Israeli-Gulf ties, particularly intelligence
cooperation, have strengthened over mutual enmity toward Iran, [the
Trump administration hopes that Saudi Arabia will push the Palestinians
to take part in a U.S.-led peace process.]{.underline}

[Senators must remember that Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in
Yemen. A cutoff of]{.underline} U.S. [support would also hurt the

which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup
that violated a U.N.-brokered ceasefire.

Withdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S.
allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and
Bahrain.

The war in Yemen is complex. [Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia
entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes
and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents
and the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting]{.underline} the
[Houthi Ansar Allah]{.underline} ("Supporters of Allah") movement, a
Shia Islamist extremist group.

The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian
casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But [the Houthis should
not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly
sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles.]{.underline}

Ansar Allah also deserves criticism for its violent role in
destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the current
humanitarian disaster. [Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi border,
launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor its
own supporters and sell on the black market.]{.underline}

[Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied
nations, and civilian shipping]{.underline} in the Red Sea with
Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs. [Undermining
the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this threat to
international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to threaten oil
shipments]{.underline} through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz.

[Those who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently
believe that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through
a one-sided strategy that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar
Allah]{.underline}, a group that chants "Death to America" and looks
more like Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese proxy group, every day.

Never mind that Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally
recognized government of Yemen in this effort. Never mind that leaving
Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the humanitarian
suffering, but only prolong it.

### Alt Causes

#### Lack of Transparency in DCS is an alt cause for the Middle East Conflict

Jeff **Abramson** **Feb. 8**, 2019 (non-resident senior fellow for arms
control and conventional arms transfers. "US Arms Policy and Sales -
U.S., Saudi Arms Transfers Top Global Trade," Arms Control Association,
https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/36, accessed 6-19-2019, SM)

[While the public can raise its voice against irresponsible Foreign
Military Sales (FMS) because such government-to-government negotiated
sales are quickly added to a public website, the increasingly important
business-led Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) are not as transparent, in
part because any public notification is obscure or functionally comes
after the initial review period has passed.]{.underline} Earlier this
month, news broke with this exact scenario on a missile defense sale to
Saudi Arabia. Members of Congress could insist that, or possibly take it
upon themselves to make, these potential DCS transactions more
transparent. [Proposed sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi
Arabia via the more opaque DCS process came to light because concerned
members of Congress took the initiative to reveal them.]{.underline}

While the notification period garners the most attention, Congress also
can block a sale up until weapons are delivered. Given how security,
geopolitical, and humanitarian realities can change between the time of
notifications and often years-later deliveries, members should follow
the entire process. In 2014, Congress gave itself the authority (see
Section 201) to receive from the State Department notification of an
arms shipment at least 30 days before its delivery. It is currently
limited to joint requests by the chair and ranking members of the SFRC
or HFAC and may have only been used once. [Those leaders should exercise
it much more diligently and Congress should consider making it much
easier to use by allowing all committee members to request pre-delivery
notifications.]{.underline}

[In general, transparency around arms deliveries remains too obscure as
a New Hampshire NPR reporter recently discovered. When U.S. census
export data showed weapons worth more than \$61 million had been sold
from his state to Saudi Arabia in August 2018, he could not uncover what
was in the sales nor which companies provided the weapons. Annual
reports on U.S. arms transfers have grown increasingly opaque. Congress
should mandate a change demanding much greater transparency on the
specifics of what is in U.S. weapons deliveries.]{.underline}

#### Saudi is willing to risk its US relationship to continue civilian casualties in Yemen -- empirics prove.

Mohamad **Bazzi** 5-17-**19** {Associate professor of journalism at New
York University, \"Both Saudi Arabia and the United States Are Probably
Guilty of War Crimes in Yemen,\" *Nation*,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/war-crimes-united-states-saudi-arabia-yemen/>,
Accessed 6/19/19} //RG

[Saudi leaders and their allies have **ignored** American entreaties to
minimize civilian casualties since the war's early days.]{.underline}
And, according to recent testimony in Congress by two members of the
Obama administration, [US officials recognized as early as 2016 that top
Saudi and UAE leaders were not interested in reducing civilian
casualties.]{.underline} In little-noticed testimony to the House
Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and International
Terrorism in early March, the two former State Department officials
explained how deeply involved the United States has been in helping the
Saudis choose their targets in Yemen, creating "no-strike" lists, and
sending trainers to help avoid civilian casualties. The officials were
Dafna Rand, a former deputy assistant secretary of state, who is now a
vice president at Mercy Corps; and Jeremy Konyndyk, former director of
the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance.

[Rand testified that soon after the Saudis launched the war in 2015, and
civilian casualties started to mount, the State Department sent a
trainer to Riyadh to work with Saudi Defense Ministry
officials.]{.underline} She said [the trainer had worked]{.underline}
with the US military's Central Command [to reduce civilian casualties in
Afghanistan]{.underline}, and US officials had thought the Saudis could
use similar techniques to reduce casualties in Yemen. "We approached
this very technically behind closed doors, very quietly, sent our
trainer in," [Rand said]{.underline}, adding that, after a cease-fire in
2016, [US officials were hopeful that their efforts were paying off. But
once the cease-fire collapsed]{.underline} in August 2016, [the Saudi
coalition attacked a series of civilian targets that caused mass
casualties. At that point]{.underline}, Rand said, "[it gave us pause to
recalibrate the strategy, and wonder what had happened to our
training.]{.underline}" The State Department continued to quietly send
the trainer to Riyadh.

But [Rand and other officials soon realized that top Saudi leaders were
not interested in limiting civilian casualties, despite American
appeals]{.underline}. She said Saudi leaders only cared if the
president---first Obama and later Trump---applied pressure or threatened
to suspend weapons sales. Rand did not mention Mohammed bin Salman, who
was then the deputy crown prince and Saudi defense minister and a major
architect of the Yemen war. "We came to the conclusion by late 2016 that
[although there were very many well-meaning and professional generals in
the Saudi Ministry of Defense, there was a lack of political will at the
top senior levels to reduce the number of civilian
casualties]{.underline}," she said.

### I/L Turn -- Asia Heg

#### Turn -- influence in Saudi is necessary to counterbalance China in the region, ending the relationship lets China go rampant with Belt and Road and steal East Asian heg.

Anand **Toprani 5-15**-2019 {Assistant Professor of Strategy and Policy
at the US Naval War College, \"Oil and the Future of U.S. Strategy in
the Persian Gulf,\" *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/oil-and-the-future-of-u-s-strategy-in-the-persian-gulf/>,
Accessed 6/20/19} //RG

[Combined with its growing demand for oil, China]{.underline} --- unlike
the Soviet Union --- [has both the means and the opportunity to
incentivize Gulf oil producers to redirect their exports to China and
away from other consumers --- including U.S. allies in East
Asia]{.underline}. A similar scenario occurred in 1915, when Britain
bought any cotton the United States was planning to export to Germany
and Austria-Hungary after Whitehall added cotton to the list of items
covered by its blockade of the Central Powers. This act mollified U.S.
cotton exporters (including their congressional patrons), who might have
otherwise objected to the loss of their European export markets.

[In the past, China was happy to leave the burden of promoting security
in the Gulf to the United States. **That no longer appears to be the
case**]{.underline}. Over 80 percent of Chinese oil imports travel
through the Indian Ocean and are susceptible to U.S. interdiction. To
counter this threat, [China is hard at work across the Gulf building
partnerships as part of its Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}. To
date, China has secured several long-term supply contracts for oil and
liquefied natural gas, measures to facilitate greater Chinese trade and
investment, and joint ventures between Chinese firms and local companies
in both the Gulf and China. Besides creating new markets for Chinese
manufactured goods and supplies of energy less vulnerable to a U.S.
blockade, [China's budding economic influence in the Gulf may eventually
give Beijing leverage to induce oil producers to adopt policies
consistent with Chinese strategic objectives. China analysts warn that
Beijing is poised, at least for the time being, to expand its political
influence in the Gulf, where its state-directed model of economic
development, indifference to human rights concerns, and lack of
historical baggage make it an appealing partner.]{.underline}

[Would China use this economic leverage in the Gulf to hurt U.S. allies?
In the case of U.S. firms with significant business interests in China,
**Beijing has demonstrated little hesitation in using economic threats**
--- specifically limiting access to China's domestic market --- **to
extract political concessions**]{.underline}. China did the same to a
number of South Korean firms in 2017 following Seoul's deployment of the
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system (THAAD). This
pressure, and the complaints of South Korean businesses, likely
influenced Seoul's decision to suspend further deployment of THAAD. [As
the nations of the Gulf become more dependent on their trade with the
Far East, so too will their sensitivity to Chinese pressure grow. **This
is particularly true of Saudi Arabia**, which is partnering with Chinese
firms to build downstream (oil refining and marketing) and petrochemical
assets in China.]{.underline}

### A2 Middle East Instability

#### So many alt causes to middle east instability -- a lack of modernization, development, growth, and intervention by other powers.

Karel **Černý 18** {Researcher at the Department of Historical Sociology
at Charles University in Prague, "SPECIAL ISSUE Great Middle Eastern
instability: Structural roots and uneven modernization 1960‐2012,"
*Wiley*, <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/johs.12191>,
Published 4/6/18, Accessed 6/22/19} //RG

The [calculations and comparisons]{.underline} undertaken in this paper
[show that instability in the Middle East today is a result of the
uneven path of modernisation over the long term]{.underline}. Overall we
see that while repressive, [weak regimes have not changed dramatically,
economic development has been volatile, gradually lost its dynamic, and
because of its rentier character could not create enough jobs for
graduates.]{.underline} The rate of the population explosion has only
gradually fallen, the proportion of twenty and thirty years olds has
increased, urbanisation has peaked, primary, secondary and now tertiary
education has expanded, and the traditional and most recently the new
media have expanded very quickly. The [uneven development of individual
dimensions of social change has increased]{.underline} over the last few
decades. During the 1950s and 60s this tendency was not so pronounced.
However, it gradually intensified and peaked at the start of the
21stcentury. Uneven modernisation therefore explains in part the timing
of the Arab revolutions and the chronic post‐revolutionary instability.

This [comparative analysis also shows, that the specific Middle Eastern
post-colonial modernisation pattern is a set of sub-processes that when
combined result in highly uneven modernisation even in an international
comparison]{.underline}: the most repressive but weak regimes in which
the [most volatile economic growth, fastest demographic
change]{.underline} (comparable only with Sub-Saharan Africa) [and very
fast social changes]{.underline} (comparable only with South America)
are played out. [As a consequence,]{.underline} modernisation in the
Middle East is most uneven and the rate of development in individual
dimensions of social change is the least synchronised of all
post-colonial macro-regions. This explains why it seems that [political
instability in the region has grown]{.underline} in comparison with
other macro‐regions.

The structural [roots]{.underline} of contemporary Middle Eastern
instability [are seen in the many complex interactions and deep
contradictions between individual dimensions of uneven
modernisation]{.underline} and its wider cultural and international
context. In the Middle East, between the 1960s and 2010s, [we can see
geographical overlappings (layerings), interactions and mutual
collisions of]{.underline} (1) the heterogeneous pre-modern cultural
substrate, (2) the [rapid social and demographic change]{.underline},
(3) the [unstable and slower economic development]{.underline}, (4) the
[slow political modernisation, and]{.underline} (5)strong [interference
of international actors and world powers.]{.underline}

To summarize, the mutually unsynchronised rate of development in the
three basic dimensions of social change gives rise to [three general
deficits. The prosperity deficit]{.underline} is [due to the excessively
rapid rate]{.underline} of change in the sociodemographic sphere [that
developments in the economic subsystem cannot keep up with]{.underline}
and co‐opt the growing cohorts of graduates with comparably higher
career, consumer, and life expectations. [The democracy deficit is due
to the excessively rapid rate]{.underline} of change in the
socio‐demographic sphere [that developments in the political subsystem
cannot keep pace with]{.underline} and is unable to co‐opt new political
actors. [The security deficit is again due to the excessively rapid rate
of change]{.underline} in the socio‐demographic sphere [that
developments in the state capacity to govern and perform basic functions
cannot keep pace with]{.underline}. [The combination]{.underline} of
these three deficits with the pre‐modern cultural substrate that
[provides meanings delegitimizing the current social and political order
is the source of the frustration and political instability in the
region]{.underline}. Also the combination of these three deficits with
the broader international context multiples both the existing structural
tensions among the three unsynchronised dimensions of social change and
the frustrations among the increasingly modern population

#### Polarization causes instability in the Middle East---not a uniquely arms issue.

The Guardian. He was the political editor of The Guardian from 2006 to

The **[Middle East's polarised]{.underline}** and repressive
**[politics]{.underline}** will **[lead to]{.underline}** even more
**[instability in the region unless countries take steps to reform and
calm tensions]{.underline}**, a senior Qatari politician has said.

**[Iranians or Palestinians did not work]{.underline}**.

#### Instability is inevitable and Iran rise is locked in based on other flawed foreign policy -- causes Shia rise and terror and alienates Palestine and Turkey.

Mahmood **Monshipouri 19** {Chair and Professor of International
Relations at San Francisco State University, "Middle East Politics:
Changing Dynamics," *Routledge*, Published 6/11/19, Accessed 6/22/19 via
Google Books.} //RG

The Bush administration's attempt at [linking the counter-proliferation
approach with a counterterrorist approach]{.underline} that stressed the
future threat of transnational terrorist cells to the US homeland
[mischaracterized the very nature]{.underline} of the terror threat.
blot every threat is directed at bringing down the entire Western
civilization and way of life.\'2 [The lingering debacle in Iraq
demonstrated the flaw of trying to create Middle East peace via the
\"transformation\" of an entire region\'s culture, economics, and
politics]{.underline}. In the first place, Iran is a Shia majority
country that could cultivate close ties with the US-backed Iraqi
government. The [Shia revival in Iraq]{.underline} in the post-Saddam
era [pointed to]{.underline} three realities: (1) [the newly empowered
Shia majority]{.underline} in Iraq presented a robust power base that
deserves recognition; (z) [the inevitable rise of Iran as regional
leader]{.underline} could no longer be denied, and (3) [Shia empowerment
across Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, and Pakistan]{.underline}
represented a greater Shia role in shaping a new power structure hi the
region. These factors were and still are interconnected and thus
mutually reinforcing.\'3

Second, [it has become increasingly clear that supporting radical Sunni
groups]{.underline} In the region in order to contain Iranian and this
influence [has---paradoxically but predictably---fueled Sunni jihadi
ideology and terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and their
operations]{.underline}. The [spread of sectarian violence in the
broader Middle East will become more virulent]{.underline} if it
reflects, as in the past, the regional power rivalry between Iran and
Saudi Arabia. Such tensions could lead to further political instability
in Afghanistan and Pakistan.75

Contrary to the Obama administration\'s attempt to foster a kind of
balance of power between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [has sought to create an anti-Iran
alliance]{.underline}---consisting of Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, and the United States---[while casting aside the
Palestinian cause and the possibility of the two-state
solution]{.underline}.\'6 [This]{.underline} US-Saudi [vision
of]{.underline} regional [order fails to consistently reflect Turkey\'s
interests and ambitions]{.underline}. Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan has forged a partnership with Tehran and
Moscow]{.underline}---despite some disagreements with the two
countries---to shape events in Syria As the main arbiter of Syria\'s
fate, Russia has become the only power broker in the region and its
cooperation must be sought.

#### Arms sales to Saudi key to contain Iran and regional allies -- the State Department agrees.

David **Brown 5-24**-19 {Deputy defense editor at POLITICO, "Weapons
worth \$8B headed to Middle East over Congress\' objections,"
*Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/8-billion-weapons-middle-east-3323593>,
Accessed 6/22/19} //RG

The Trump administration on Friday notified Congress it plans to sell
[\$8.1 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United
Arab Emirates]{.underline} without congressional approval --- a move
that has incensed members from both parties who have sought to cut off
military aid for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed rebels
in Yemen.

The decision [covers 22 pending transfers of munitions, aircraft parts,
and other supplies \"to deter Iranian aggression and build partner
self-defense capacity,\"]{.underline} Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo
said]{.underline} in a statement. [\"These sales will support our
allies, enhance Middle East stability, and help these nations to deter
and defend themselves from the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"]{.underline}

Normally such sales are subject to congressional approval. But Trump is
using a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act that allows him to
bypass the process in case of emergency. The move is similar to Trump\'s
declaration of a border emergency this year, which allowed him to divert
military funds to pay for border barriers.

Pompeo, who cited previous instances in which the arms sales [authority
was used by]{.underline} Presidents Ronald [Reagan and]{.underline}
Jimmy [Carter]{.underline}, said the step was critical to help allies
maintain their armed forces in a period of \"increasing regional
volatility.\" And he lashed out at Congress for delaying the shipments.

\"These national security [concerns have been exacerbated
by]{.underline} many months of Congressional [delay]{.underline} in
addressing these critical requirements, [and have called into doubt our
reliability as a provider of defense capabilities, opening opportunities
for U.S. adversaries to exploit,\"]{.underline} Pompeo said.

#### Saudi Arabia is our only regional partner -- key to general stability and every regional scenario.

Anthony H. **Cordesman 18** {Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, "Saudi Arabia is a
critical American security partner in the Middle East," *The Hill*,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-american-security-partner-in-the-middle-east,
Published 3/21/18, Accessed 6/22/19} //RG

Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that [our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our **most important
single security partner**. Israel]{.underline}'s security is certainly a
key American concern, but it [does not play an active role in most of
America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with
Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS
and Al Qaeda.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner has also been enhanced by
the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their own internal
stability]{.underline} and their roles in the region have sharply
diminished, [and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major instability
problems]{.underline} and are at war. Our [European allies have
declining power projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the region
is increasingly problematic]{.underline}.

It is certainly true that [Saudi Arabia needs the United States as much
or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia. Saudi military forces
are steadily improving, but it is the U.S. presence in the region that
create a balance of forces that firmly deters Iran and has helped Saudi
Arabia defeat its own terrorist threats from groups like Al Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula. **U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and exercises
also play a critical role in improving Saudi forces.**]{.underline}

But [the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well. Saudi Arabia is now
the most critical single security partner in ensuring the stable flow of
petroleum out of the Gulf region]{.underline}. While [the United
States]{.underline} is largely eliminating its need for direct petroleum
imports, it [is steadily increasing its dependence on the health and
growth of the global economy and imports from Asian states]{.underline}
like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, [which are critically
dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result is that U.S.
strategic interests in the region continue to increase in spite of the
steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports.]{.underline}

This is why [focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi
investment in the United States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia
has played in fight terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to
cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi
Arabia does not face real threats is not the way the United States
should deal with Crown Prince M]{.underline}ohammed [B]{.underline}in
[S]{.underline}alman['s visit to the White House.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia's]{.underline} reform and economic [development plans are
critical to its stability and the region's security. The kingdom needs
U.S. encouragement and an understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot
implement these plans effectively without outside support.]{.underline}
The burden sharing argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be
treated as a source of ready money every time the United States has a
need.

It is already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on security,
which is three times the economic burden security places on the United
States. This spending is too high given the kingdom's other needs, and
[the United States should be focusing on better ways to make its
security partnerships with Saudi Arabia, as well as the other Gulf
states and Jordan more efficient]{.underline} and less costly, not
simply on spending more.

At the same time, [Iran is all too real a threat. Effective joint action
in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs, its ballistic and cruise
missile programs, its asymmetric threats to Gulf shipping, and expending
military influence in the region are all critical common U.S. and Saudi
priorities.]{.underline}

[The United States also badly needs to find some common approach to
dealing with Iraq and Syria that will move both towards recovery and
lasting stability, limit Iranian and Russian influence as much as
possible, and help stabilize relations with Turkey]{.underline}. There
are no easy options in either case, but [Saudi Arabia is the key
potential Arab partner any such efforts]{.underline}.

[The United States, especially members of Congress, needs to remember
that we have had at least as many military problems in fighting the Iraq
and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have faced
in fighting in Yemen. Cutting U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may do
little more that lead the Saudis to ignore the systems that the United
States has helped set up to limit targeting of civilians and using
unguided and more damaging air munitions. It raises a whole new round of
questions about the U.S commitment to its partners in the
region]{.underline}.

[We need to forge a common solution in Yemen, not a decoupling that
leaves Saudi Arabia exposed. This would fail in both military and human
rights terms, and leaves both the United States and Saudi Arabia with no
options for dealing with the Houthi or Iran, seeking ways to end the
war, dealing with Al Qaida or the other terrorist movements in Yemen,
and without any means to help Yemen back to some form of stability and
development.]{.underline}

and the U.S. will not engage in a military conflict]{.underline}, even
as the Trump administration appeared to escalate tensions with Tehran
two days earlier by announcing the deployment of 1,000 additional troops
to the Middle East.

"[There will not be a military confrontation between Iran and America

"[Accusing other countries has turned into a common practice among U.S.
officials as they try to pressure other counties]{.underline},"
Shamkhani said.

[Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior Trump administration
officials have accused Iran of perpetrating attacks on two oil tankers
in the Gulf of Oman last week, though Tehran has denied
responsibility]{.underline} for the explosions which partly destroyed
the vessels.

A U.S. Navy official said Wednesday that a limpet mine used in the
attack on one of the tankers, the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, bore
a striking resemblance to similar Iranian explosive devices, according
to [the Associated
Press](https://www.apnews.com/5484dc4a51644fa9839546e1cd7bf89f).

Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami insisted Wednesday that Tehran was
not behind the tanker assaults, declaring that \"the accusation against
Iran is totally a lie and I dismiss it firmly,\" according to the
semi-official Fars news agency and the
[AP](https://www.apnews.com/ddb98eeee92b4d5390d5bd31ce15462b).

In response to the alleged Iranian attacks, acting Defense Secretary

the Pentagon's latest deployment of American forces "to address air,
naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East," he said in a
statement.

"The recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence
we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy
groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the
region," Shanahan added.

Tehran on Monday also ramped up the potential for a military conflict
with the U.S. after a spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization
announced the country would soon breach the uranium stockpile limits
established by a 2015 multinational nuclear deal.

#### Halting weapons sales will embolden Iran

**Arab News 6/20-** **(Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper
published in Saudi Arabia, "Saudi Arabia says halt in arms sales will
embolden Iran," Arab News,
<http://www.arabnews.com/node/1513631/saudi-arabia>, 6/20/19//jld)**

[Halting weapons sales to Saudi Arabia will only benefit Iran, Adel
Al-Jubeir said Wednesday, after the British government announced it
would suspend issuing new licenses for the sale of arms to the
Kingdom.]{.underline}

The UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox announced the decision
in parliament after a court ordered the government to "reconsider" the
sales because of their humanitarian impact in Yemen.

[Fox said he disagreed with the judgement and would seek permission to
appeal.]{.underline}

[Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir said the
deployment of weapons in Yemen was legitimate.]{.underline}

["The decision by the court in the UK has to do with procedures for
licensing, not any wrongdoing that took place," Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir told reporters in London.]{.underline}

"[The coalition is an ally of the West and the coalition is fighting a
legitimate war at the behest of a legitimate government to stop Iran and
its proxies from taking over a strategically important country - so the
only beneficiary of a cut-off of weapons to the coalition is going to be
Iran."]{.underline}

The court ruling does not halt Britain\'s arms exports but means the
granting of new licences will be paused.

Leading British defence firm BAE Systems said it would continue to
support the UK government "in providing equipment, support and training
under government to government agreements between the United Kingdom and
Saudi Arabia."

Saudi Arabia is part of the Arab coalition fighting to support the
internationally recognized government in Yemen which was driven from the
capital Sanaa in 2014 by Iran-backed militants.

[Saudi Arabia accounted for 43 percent of Britain\'s global arms sales

Sarah, "Giving Up the High Ground - America's Retreat on Human Rights,"
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/13/giving-high-ground-americas-retreat-human-rights>,
accessed on 5/9/19, JMP)

**[No U.S. president has spoken about human rights the
way]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump has]{.underline}**. During the
campaign, [he praised Saddam]{.underline} Hussein [for his approach to
counterterrorism in Iraq]{.underline}: "He killed terrorists. He did
that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They
were a terrorist. It was over." He promised to loosen the restrictions
on interrogating terrorism suspects: "I would bring back a hell of a lot
worse than waterboarding." [He went out of his way to
compliment]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin's abusive
rule]{.underline}: "In terms of leadership, he is getting an A." And in
a television interview shortly after his inauguration, when asked why he
respected Putin---"a killer," in the interviewer's words---Trump
responded, "We've got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country's
so innocent?"

As president, he has kept at it. Last April, [he chose to congratulate
Turkish President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip [Erdogan for winning a
disputed referendum that expanded his authoritarian rule]{.underline}.
In a call that same month, he spoke to Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte, whose bloody campaign under the guise of a "war on drugs" has
taken the lives of over 12,000 Filipinos. Trump praised Duterte for
doing an "unbelievable job on the drug problem." When they met in Manila
in November, Trump laughed heartily after Duterte cut off questions from
reporters and called them "spies"---this in a country where journalists
and activists sometimes end up dead. Before heading to China, Trump
congratulated President Xi Jinping, who had just further cemented his
repressive rule at a Communist Party congress, for his "great political
victory."

[All U.S. presidents have, to varying degrees, downplayed or even
overlooked concerns about human rights in order to get things done with
unsavory foreign partners. But **none has seemed so eager as Trump to
align with autocrats as a matter of course**.]{.underline} The harm goes
beyond mere words. **[In country after country]{.underline}**, the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is gutting U.S. support for
human rights, the rule of law, and good governance, damaging the
overarching credibility of the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Within the United States' borders, meanwhile,
the Trump administration has unleashed an assault on nondiscrimination
and equal justice.

[Even before Trump was elected, human rights were under attack across
the globe.]{.underline} With crisis, conflict, and instability gripping
much of the world, [repressive leaders from Ethiopia to Russia to
Thailand have used these developments to justify tightening their hold
on power]{.underline}---cracking down harder on dissent while rejecting
the rule of law and flouting international norms. [Now, with Trump in
office, there's little reason to believe that such initiatives will be
met with much criticism or consequences from the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Indeed, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration['s]{.underline} [chaotic and
virtually values-free approach to foreign policy is bolstering this
global deterioration while corroding the institutions and alliances
needed to reverse it]{.underline}.

### \-\-- XT: Alt Causes to Human Rights

#### Trump actions toward UNHCR thump the advantage

**Margon, 18** \-\-- Washington Director at Human Rights Watch (2/13/18,

<https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/13/giving-high-ground-americas-retreat-human-rights>,
accessed on 5/9/19, JMP)

**[On foreign policy]{.underline}**, meanwhile, **[the administration
has dismissed or damaged the global human rights
framework]{.underline}**. Under [Trump]{.underline}, the United States
[has walked away from (or threatened to walk away from) a number of
vital global commitments, institutions, and initiatives that would
provide an opportunity to share the burden of combating global
challenges while respecting rights]{.underline}. The administration has
threatened to withdraw from [the UN Human Rights Council]{.underline},
largely because the Palestinian territories (and therefore Israel) are a
permanent item on its agenda. It's true that the council [has flaws, but
it has also successfully documented and exposed many human rights
issues]{.underline} of concern to U.S. law and policymakers. [Walking
away would not only weaken the council but also limit the available
avenues for Washington to promote human rights.]{.underline} From the
UN's negotiations on the compact for global migration to the Paris
agreement on climate change, the Trump administration has repeatedly
suggested multilateral institutions are of no use to the United States,
even though the country was instrumental in creating the UN, as well as
many of the norms and laws that guide thinking about human rights today.

#### Trump undermines human rights activists

<https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/13/giving-high-ground-americas-retreat-human-rights>,
accessed on 5/9/19, JMP)

[**When it comes to human rights, symbolism matters, and under this
administration, human rights activists have been made to feel as though
they aren't important.** The president and his top national security
officials have metwith very few frontline activists and have held very
few meetings with civil society]{.underline} before or during overseas
trips---[a practice that previous presidents often used so as to hear
directly from ordinary citizens about the challenges they were
facing]{.underline}.

#### Rhetorical support for dictators also thumps the advantage

accessed on 5/9/19, JMP)

[Words matter]{.underline}, too, [and Trump's fulsome praise of
strongmen]{.underline}, many of whom he has hosted at the White House
with great fanfare and little condemnation, [has been taken by many as
permission for brutality]{.underline}. [Last April, he congratulated
Egyptian President]{.underline} Abdel Fattah el-[Sisi, a military
dictator who has overseen a vicious crackdown on government critics, for
doing "a fantastic job."]{.underline} [The next month, counter to a
promise made to the White House, Sisi signed a draconian law regulating
civil society.]{.underline} Perhaps he was emboldened by Trump's comment
in Saudi Arabia a week earlier: "We are not here to lecture---we are not
here to tell other people how to live." [On]{.underline} that same
[visit to Saudi Arabia, Trump told]{.underline} Hamad bin Isa
al-[Khalifa, the king of Bahrain, "There won't be strain with this
administration," which the Bahraini regime evidently viewed as a green
light to intensify repression.]{.underline} As Nabeel [Rajab, an
imprisoned Bahraini activist (and member of Human Rights Watch's Middle
East advisory committee), has written, "It was no coincidence that days
later, Bahraini police used the deadliest force we have seen in decades,
killing five protesters."]{.underline}

Similarly, [politicians looking to discredit the free press have latched
on to the term "fake news," one of Trump's favorite
phrases]{.underline}. [In Syria]{.underline}, President [Bashar al-Assad
rejected an Amnesty International report documenting the brutal killing
of 13,000 military prisoners, saying, "You can forge anything these
days. We are living in a fake-news era."]{.underline} In Myanmar, where
security forces have undertaken a campaign of ethnic cleansing against
Rohingya Muslims, a government official went so far as to say, "There is
no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news." **[The term has become a
catch phrase for government officials in China, the Philippines, Russia,
and Venezuela who wish to shield themselves from scrutiny and create a
climate of fear that vilifies dissenting voices.]{.underline}** Indeed,
according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has been
keeping a database of imprisoned journalists since the early 1990s, the
number of people charged with reporting "false news" rose to a record
high in 2017.

#### Trump failure to appear at the IAC kills human rights cred

Lauren **Carasik** 3/27/**17**, a clinical professor of law and the
Director of the International Human Rights Clinic at Western New England
University School of Law, \"Why Washington was a no show at human rights
hearings\", Al Jazeera,
www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/03/washington-show-human-rights-hearings-170326102511868.html

[The Trump administration\'s failure to appear at hearings at the
**I**nter-**A**merican **C**ommission on Human Rights on March 21
telegraphs its **disregard** for international institutions generally
and human rights in particular]{.underline}. [Trump officials notified
the Commission]{.underline}, which is the independent human rights organ
of the Organization of American States, [a day before the scheduled
hearings that it would not attend.]{.underline} State Department
official contended that it would be inappropriate to participate since
several of the hearings addressed issues under judicial review: the
administration\'s executive actions on immigration and its greenlighting
of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which are winding their ways through the
courts. But that explanation failed to assuage [critics]{.underline},
who [argued that Washington\'s absence **erodes** its **legitimacy**,
**emboldens authoritarian leaders** in the hemisphere to shrug off their
own accountability and dodge dialogue and presages **broader
disengagement** with international **h**uman **r**ights
institutions.]{.underline} International criticism [The move represented
an abrupt departure from past practice]{.underline}. The United States
has a long, bipartisan history of engaging with the Commission, even
when the topic is being litigated. Further undermining the
administration\'s stated excuse, among the hearings scheduled were the
country\'s failure to respect the rights of asylum seekers - grievances
that predate the Trump administration but endure under his watch - and a
case about Peruvian-Japanese detention during World War II that is not
the subject of pending litigation. A State Department official sought to
offer reassuring words, claiming that the refusal to participate \"does
not have any bearing on current or future US engagement with the
Commission\". But if ongoing litigation were really the driving force
behind Washington\'s absence, officials could have signalled their
respect for the process and the participating parties by attending the
meeting and rebuffing questions they deemed inadvisable to answer.
[Human rights groups were outraged. Jamil Dakwar, director of the
American Civil Liberties Union human rights programme, noted: \"This is
another worrying sign that the Trump Administration is not only
launching an assault on human rights at home, but is also trying to
undermine international bodies charged with holding abusive governments
accountable.\" And according to Clara Long, US Programme researcher at
Human Rights Watch: \"In pulling out of this hearing, the United States
is offering a negative example for the rest of the countries in the
Americas]{.underline}, who show up and engage in the Inter-American
system.\" [The refusal to participate puts the US in the company of
other countries whose human rights records it disdains.]{.underline}
Some observers have suggested that the administration\'s decision may be
more reflective of lax attention to protocols and its staffing of the
State Department than outright hostility to the Commission and its
mission. But [whether the result of intentional snub, dysfunction or
different priorities, **the move damages US leadership**. \"This reduces
a lot of the Trump administration\'s credibility and legitimacy on human
rights issues,\"]{.underline} Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the Americas
division of Human Rights Watch, told the Miami Herald. [\"In addition to
it being a symbol of arrogance, \[the US\] **risks not being taken
seriously** when they criticise other countries for not showing up at
these hearings,\"]{.underline} Vivianco said. The administration\'s
absence didn\'t thwart the proceedings, during which groups offered
testimony amid the spectacle of empty chairs administration officials
were expected to fill, while Commission officials expressed dismay at
Washington\'s intransigence. Commission Vice President Margarette May
Macaulay called the administration\'s refusal to show up \"a pity\",
while Commissioner Paulo Vannuchi lamented the refusal to attend,
\"which is what would have made it possible for there to be a democratic
exchange of opposing views being aired\". Trump and human rights [The
move occurred against the backdrop of other indications that the Trump
administration has little interest in embracing a multilateral approach
to human rights and institutions.]{.underline} Earlier last week, UN
ambassador Nikki Haley announced that the US was boycotting a UN Human
Rights Council session because of perceived anti-Israel bias. Secretary
of State Rex [Tillerson]{.underline} previously [threatened to withdraw
from the **H**uman **R**ights Council]{.underline} altogether, given
what he says is unfair treatment of Israel, as well as the inclusion of
countries with blemished human rights records among its ranks. In a
letter obtained by Foreign Policy, the top diplomat said that the human
rights body required \"substantial reform\" if the US is to remain
involved. [Tillerson also provoked consternation when he skipped the
release of the State Department\'s annual **h**uman **r**ights
report]{.underline}, which reviews the record of all other nations but
abstains from assessing its own shortcomings. [Critics are wary of other
administration efforts to undermine transnational accountability, such
as its effective withdrawal from Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to cut
billions from UN funding, which could usher in a \"breakdown of the
international humanitarian system as we know it\".]{.underline} Under
ordinary circumstances, Washington prefers not to be named and shamed
for violating international norms. But Trump\'s contempt for
multilateralism and accountability is hardly surprising. After all,
[this president previously expressed no qualms about promoting torture,
filling up Guantanamo Bay prison and killing the families of
terrorists.]{.underline} To be sure, Washington\'s human rights record
has been far from perfect, both at home and abroad, but at least the
Obama administration promoted the architecture of internationalism and
the human rights principles and protections it sought to uphold. [While
the Trump administration has given occasional, anemic lip service to
these ideals, its **actions speak far louder than words.**]{.underline}

### 1nc Fill-in Turns Human Rights

#### U.S. can't shape the arms market because buyers can shift if the U.S. shows restraint AND Russia and China don't care about human rights

**The Economist, 18** (8/18/2018, "The global arms trade is booming.
Buyers are spoiled for choice; Increased competition between suppliers
means buyers have the upper hand,"
<https://www.economist.com/international/2018/08/18/the-global-arms-trade-is-booming-buyers-are-spoiled-for-choice>,
accessed on 6/4/19, JMP)

ONLY a few months ago, Canadians were earnestly debating whether or not
the country's Liberal administration was right to go ahead with
executing a \$12bn contract to deliver armoured vehicles to Saudi
Arabia. The government said it would, but acknowledged its critics'
concerns by agreeing to adopt a version of an international treaty that
limits arms sales to rogues (see article).

However, things took a different turn. It was the Saudis who plunged the
deal into uncertainty. [After Canada's foreign minister urged the
release of some political prisoners]{.underline} on Twitter, [the Saudi
government declared that all new business with Canada was
suspended]{.underline}. This left Canadians unsure if the kingdom still
wants the arms deal. And [if the Saudis do walk away, plenty of other
countries will be happy to supply armoured cars]{.underline}. "They
could get their combat vehicles from Turkey, South Korea or Brazil,"
says Pieter Wezeman, a researcher at SIPRI, a Stockholm-based
think-tank.

[In the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
meanwhile, [Congress has been pressing the administration to implement
the letter of a law that would force countries to make a hard, instant
choice between buying American or Russian weapons. But the Pentagon is
hinting that **America's huge diplomatic power does not quite stretch
that far**]{.underline}. Defence officials argue it would be better to
accept that some countries will go on buying Russian weapons for a
while, in the hope they will gradually kick the habit.

Both [these developments reflect the volatile]{.underline} (and from a
Western viewpoint, barely controllable) [state of the global arms
market. Total demand is growing, the number of sellers is rising and
**the Western countries that have dominated the business are less
confident of shaping the playing field**]{.underline}. Above all,
**[buyers are becoming more insistent on their right to shop
around]{.underline}**. [For the likes of India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
the United Arab Emirates, "this is a buyer's market," says]{.underline}
Lucie [Béraud-Sudreau of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies]{.underline}, a London-based think-tank.

Speak softly and sell a big stick

The numbers show that [the global commerce in conventional weapons is
still dominated by the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [But America feels strangely nervous about
maintaining that role, and this year it has adopted a more aggressive
sales posture]{.underline}. Under a policy proclaimed in April and
mapped out in more detail last month, American diplomats have been told
to promote weapons sales more actively and speed up procedures for
approving them.

At first sight, American apprehensions seem puzzling. There are several
ways to measure the arms market, but America comes out on top of all of
them. SIPRI has studied the volume of cross-border weapon transfers over
the five years to December and compared them with the previous five
years (see chart).

The size of the world market rose by 10% between the two periods. In the
more recent one, America's slice of this expanding pie was 34%, up from
30% in the previous five years. America and its five nearest rivals (in
descending order Russia, France, Germany, China and Britain), account
for nearly 80% of total transfers.

Britain, meanwhile, claims that last year it jumped to third place among
global arms exporters, as measured by the value of their sales.
According to the Defence and Security Organisation, a government body,
America bagged 53% of the global business, its "highest-ever market
share". This left 16% for Russia and 12% for Britain, double the share
taken by France.

In part, [the jumpiness in Washington]{.underline}, DC, [stems from the
entry to the market of new competitors, especially China]{.underline}.
In part it reflects new products and technologies where America will
struggle to keep its lead. Both these challenges were highlighted by the
appearance at last year's Paris Air Show of a Chinese military drone
that looked very like the American unmanned aircraft that have been used
for assassinations, for example in Pakistan. Hitherto, America has been
willing to share these powerful drones only with close European allies.
A new policy will broaden the range of customers and thus lessen the
risk that China will dominate a market that could soon be worth \$50bn a
year.

**[China]{.underline}** has long been better known as a buyer of arms,
mainly from Russia, than as a seller. A big share of its arms deliveries
have gone to close allies such as Pakistan. But it **[has enormously
increased its capacity to make and sell its own weapons, including ships
and submarines]{.underline}**.

Meanwhile, [American arms-export policy has been a delicate balance
between]{.underline}, on the one hand, [seizing economic and
geopolitical opportunity and, on the other, being careful not to share
technologies which could destabilise war zones or be used against
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

But **[such caution can be counter-productive]{.underline}**. At a panel
discussion in Washington this month, **[a defence-industry advocate
lamented that, because of America's technology-transfer curbs, France
had won from it a contract to sell airborne radar to
India]{.underline}**. "I like the French, but I like American industry
even more," he grumbled.

In another Franco-American contest over technology, France is finding it
hard to sell more Rafale combat aircraft to its prize arms customer,
Egypt, because the accompanying Scalp cruise missile incorporates
American know-how, the transfer of which to third parties is barred.
France has promised to develop its own technology, but Egypt may not
have the patience to wait. Egypt's government has also been a keen
purchaser of Russian equipment, including aircraft and attack
helicopters.

[For defence-equipment manufacturers such as Britain and France, export
sales matter ever more as a way to maintain their own
industries.]{.underline} Britain's edge in military aviation may depend
on its sales to Saudi Arabia. And the Royal Navy's ambitious building
programme got a boost when Australia said it would buy British for a new
range of frigates. France wants to develop a new air-to-air missile, but
only, as Florence Parly, the defence minister, put it, if it can get
foreign customers.

[Such desperation adds to the frenzy of market competition. So does
**the utter indifference Russia and China display towards their
customers' human-rights policies**.]{.underline} [So too does the growth
in the number of countries that have graduated]{.underline} from being
mainly buyers of weapons and knowhow [to sellers---Turkey, the Emirates
and South Korea]{.underline}, for example.

Japan, which boasts a huge defence industry, is entirely new to the
market. It plunged in when the government lifted restrictions on arms
exports in 2014. It competes, albeit from a fairly weak position, with
China for Asia-Pacific customers.

As for [Russia]{.underline}, SIPRI calculates that its share of the
global market has slipped (to about 22% in 2013-17). But it [offers a
blend of tried-and-tested hardware and, to a few customers, superb
know-how, especially in air defence]{.underline}.

That creates a dilemma for America, which hopes soon to sell weapons
worth \$6bn to India, but is dismayed by that country's determination to
acquire S-400 air-defence systems from Russia: missiles that could ward
off potential threats from China or Pakistan. Other countries intent on
continuing to buy Russian include Indonesia and Vietnam.

Jim [Mattis]{.underline}, America's defence secretary, has [implored
Congress not to be too harsh with Russia's customers, so long as they
pledge gradually to reduce their reliance]{.underline}. In a letter
leaked in July to Breaking Defense, a specialist news service, he told a
congressman: **["We are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
decrease Russia's dominance in key regions." But that could only happen
if America were free to sell its own weapons.]{.underline}** For
customers, that means that for the foreseeable future they can keep both
American and Russian weapons in their arsenals.

It is telling that India has recently been admitted to the Missile
Technology Control Regime, a group of countries which promises not to
help pariah states obtain ballistic missiles. That will make it easier
for both America and Russia to sell long-range rockets to India. The two
arms-sales giants, who do not agree on much else, have welcomed India
into the club.

#### U.S. government shutdown and Brexit should wreck democratic model \-\-- Russia and China are capitalizing on it

Winston Churchill's oft-quoted remark that "democracy is the worst form
of government except for all those other forms that have been tried" has
long been considered axiomatic in many quarters. But the idea, which
Churchill borrowed from someone else, is now contested across the globe.
[China's authoritarian economic model has become a source of
inspiration]{.underline}---or what President Xi Jinping has described as
a "new option"---[for would-be autocrats who are no longer persuaded
that rights and freedoms are prerequisites for prosperity, much less
their own survival in office]{.underline}.

[Right now, the spectacular tempest unfolding in both Washington (due to
the longest government shutdown in U.S. history) and in London (over the
Brexit impasse) is laying bare the fissures and frailties of two of the
world's most stable and vaunted democracies.]{.underline} The stakes are
high for the United States and, even more so, for the future of the
United Kingdom and the entire European Union. Pundits and voters are
understandably focused on when and how their careening, almost
out-of-control governments will eventually come to rest. Yet [the fact
that these two chaotic episodes are unfolding simultaneously poses risks
for the claim---seen in many quarters as increasingly tenuous---that
democracy is the world's most credible and effective political
system.]{.underline}

[While the American and British publics have grown almost inured to the
chaos in their capitals, **the rest of the world is looking on,
dumbstruck by the dysfunction**.]{.underline} [Autocrats have long
appealed to voters by claiming they will bring "order" after
chaos]{.underline}, hence the lingering legend that Benito Mussolini
made the trains run on time.

**[The twin crises in Washington and London provide rhetorical
ammunition for governments that are invested in promoting a narrative of
Western degeneration and the decline of democracy.]{.underline}**
[Beijing has not been subtle in gloating over what it hopes the world
will view as an unfavorable contrast to its tightly scripted brand of
politics.]{.underline} China's state-run Xinhua news service put it
plainly in an editorial about last year's shorter shutdown, "The Western
democratic system is hailed by the developed world as near perfect and
the most superior political system to run a country. ... However, what's
happening in the United States today will make more people worldwide
reflect on the viability and legitimacy of such a chaotic political
system." This year, [Chinese media outlets are crowing about the
potentially catastrophic consequences to the U.S. economy of a prolonged
shutdown that results in a downgrade of U.S. credit ratings and a rise
in borrowing costs]{.underline}; a typical headline was "Owning US
government bonds like holding a ticking time bomb."

[Russia is promoting a similar narrative.]{.underline} An opinion piece
published by the Kremlin-backed RT portrayed the Brexit debacle as the
inevitable downfall of "a state born in mercantilism and sustained by
centuries of empire and colonialism," concluding that "the UK as we know
it, is past its sell-by date."

**[Observers in other democracies are watching ruefully.]{.underline}**
In India, a Hindustan Times editorial wrote: "This tells us something
about the usefulness of calling referendums with binary choices on
extremely complex issues. The entire world should learn from the UK's
experience." In Hong Kong, where democracy advocates are struggling to
fend off an increasingly intrusive China, the South China Morning Post
columnist Richard Harris called out the "aggressively personal attacks"
on lawmakers in the Brexit fracas, saying, "Churchill would spin in his
grave." In South Africa's Daily Maverick, the security expert David
Africa observed a "clash between rational politics and one based on
'alternative facts' and imperial nostalgia ... rooted in white
nationalism" at work in both Britain and the United States, impairing
prospects for partnership "at a time when the need for Euro-African
partnership in trade and security" as a counterweight to Chinese
economic intervention "is not only required but eminently possible."

private problem-solving, fueled by the demands of a 24-hour news cycle
and social media audiences with an insatiable appetite for further
flamethrowing to like and share. [While similar periodic shutdowns have

both the longest in history and it comes against the backdrop of the
convention-shattering disorder of**]{.underline} the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration, [the president's deepening legal
troubles, and mounting questions over where his loyalties (other than to
himself) really lie]{.underline}.

[In Britain, the stakes are even higher. Former Prime]{.underline}

over the fate of the middle and working classes amid rising immigration,
automation, income inequality, and wage stagnation.]{.underline} The
masterminds of the Brexit vote fled for the hills as soon as the measure
was passed, leaving Prime Minister Theresa May with the impossible

deal that, no matter how artfully crafted, would do irreparable harm to
both parties.

#### U.S. democracy unlikely to be modeled now 

**Nossel, 19** \-\-- CEO of the Pen American Center and was formerly
deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at
the U.S. State Department (1/24/19, Suzanne, "Trump and May Are
Discrediting Democracy; Chaos and dysfunction in Washington and London

All this raises fundamental questions about the viability and appeal of
democracy. Francis Fukuyama has long acknowledged that his 1992 theory
that we had reached an "end of history," culminating in the global
triumph of liberal democracy, was at best premature. Yet [there has
remained a widespread belief that, all things being equal, democracy is
both fairer and more functional than any other system, meaning that if
countries and peoples were in a position to rechart their destiny,
democracy would be the obvious direction.]{.underline}

This conclusion has been supported and helped along by legions of
officials, programs, organizations, and experts informed by their
experiences in democracies all over the world but also by an ingrained
belief in the system that is usually bred in the West. [Amid global
efforts to seed and nurture democracy in Eastern Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, **the stability and
functionality of Western democracies have been an article of
faith**.]{.underline}

Multimillion-dollar U.S. government-sponsored programs and countless
nongovernmental organizations have run programs to train and support
aspiring democrats, help establish election codes and procedures, lay
the groundwork for the rule of law, and otherwise foster democratic
development. In all these cases, [the premise is that citizens of
Western democracies, and Americans in particular, know how this is
done]{.underline}. Indeed, [every four years at the Democratic and
Republican national conventions, observers from less developed
democracies the world over join in the raucous festivities with the aim
of]{.underline}, as the National Democratic Institute put it,
["see\[ing\] the American democratic process at work first hand and ...
spark\[ing\] meaningful conversations at home about the future of
democracy in their own countries."]{.underline} **[After the last few
years, it's hard to imagine inviting representatives from overseas to
come to the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to see what democracy ought to look
like]{.underline}**.

### 1nc Democracy Resilient 

#### US and global democracy [resilient]{.underline} 

**Stavridis 18** (Admiral Stavridis, was the 16th Supreme Allied
Commander at NATO and is an Operating Executive at The Carlyle Group,
"Democracy Isn\'t Perfect, But It Will Still Prevail," 7-12,
<http://time.com/5336615/democracy-will-prevail/>)

But **[countervailing forces are at work]{.underline}** as well. The
realities of Russia's nuclear arms and China's rising economic clout,
and the fact that neither country has ever had a sustained period of
democratic rule, make it easy to forget that the world's dominant
military and economic forces remain in the hands of committed
democracies. And around the world, [many often overlooked nations have
been demonstrating that even imperfect democracies can prevail over this
century's new challenges.]{.underline} Take [India]{.underline}, where
over 550 million people voted in the last election --- a monumental
number. Its democracy is hardly unblemished. Critics say Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is eroding liberal
institutions, and India ranks 138 out of 180 countries in press freedom,
according to Reporters Without Borders. But in all of my contacts with
senior Indian officials, including members of the military who might be
expected to favor top-down order, I [have]{.underline} always found [an
**unwavering commitment** to democracy]{.underline}. It has assured
India decades of stability and growth in the face of terrorist attacks,
economic strife and massive population shifts. Democracy might hardly
seem the most efficient response to a half-century's disorder in
[Colombia]{.underline}. And yet despite a virulent insurgency since the
mid-1960s, [power continues to transfer peacefully]{.underline} in that
nation. President Alvaro Uribe gave up the presidency at the end of his
constitutionally limited second term in 2010, despite high popularity
and calls for him to amend the constitution to stay on. His successor,
Juan Manuel Santos, negotiated a comprehensive but controversial peace
agreement with the communist-inspired guerrillas known as FARC, for
their formal name's acronym in Spanish. This year, as Santos' second
term came to an end, the nation began a heated debate over the peace
deal. Democracy provided the answer: an election on June 17 put a stark
choice before the people. Iván Duque, a business-friendly pragmatist who
pledged to impose harsher terms on the former rebels, defeated Gustavo
Petro, who supported the peace agreement. A nation whose upheaval might
easily have led to authoritarianism has again and again chosen free
debate and open elections. So it is as well in [Brazil]{.underline}, a
superpower-size nation of 200 million that, [despite]{.underline}
considerable political [turmoil, has not turned back toward
autocracy]{.underline}. [Mexico has just elected]{.underline} Andrés
Manuel López [Obrador]{.underline} as its President --- perhaps not the
first choice of the U.S., given his left-leaning agenda, but [another
example of democracy at work]{.underline} as the third-largest nation in
the Americas swings from right to left following free elections.
[Technological developments may yet prove a net positive for
democracy]{.underline}. I have visited the tiny former Soviet state of
Armenia many times, and gotten to know the former President and Prime
Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Until recently, he appeared to be an unbeatable
authoritarian figure. But weeks of protests, powered by the Internet,
caused him to resign in April, and propelled a new leader, Nikol
Pashinyan, into power. [In Tunisia, the Internet-fueled Arab Spring has
persisted. The democratically elected government]{.underline} that
replaced the 23-year dictatorship of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali
[has remained in power through]{.underline} recurring [free and fair
elections]{.underline}. Yes, there are worrying trends in the
government's responses to media criticism and protests. But the fact
that [democratic institutions have held up for seven years]{.underline}
is cause for optimism. [Tunisia's experience reflects
a]{.underline}nother [often overlooked asset democracy brings around the
world: its **flexibility**]{.underline}. The U.S. too often failed to
recognize this during and after the Cold War, sometimes siding with
dictators rather than accepting that not all democracies look alike.
[Part of Tunisia's success has come from adapting its electoral system
to its own culture, through a constitution that gives Islam a role in
the public sphere]{.underline}. [Enduring democratic
structures]{.underline} in Chile, Indonesia, South Korea and elsewhere
[**differ significantly** from the secular Western model]{.underline}.
[Another boon for democracy is the growing role of women in
governance]{.underline}. Powerful female champions of democracy and
civil rights have emerged around the world, from Michelle Bachelet of
Chile to Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of
Liberia, the first elected female head of state in Africa. Female
representation has increased in national parliaments, from 15% in 2002
to 19.8% in 2012, the most recent year available. The rise to power of
those representing 50% of the world's population can only be good for
the legitimacy and durability of democracy. Moreover, countries with
higher levels of gender equality are less likely to engage in internal
or external conflict, according to the World Bank. Women's participation
in conflict prevention and resolution often helps ensure success;
agreements that include women and civil-society groups are 64% less
likely to fail than those that do not, according to a U.N.-sponsored
study. Perhaps most important, [democracy remains strong in its
traditional redoubts]{.underline}. [Most of the world's most developed
countries are still highly committed democracies, including Japan,
Canada, France, Australia and Germany]{.underline}. That's no accident.
[China's rise]{.underline} may seem like economic validation of
authoritarianism, but it [has come by liberalizing a backward
agrarianism to mimic established democracies]{.underline}, and by
stealing their intellectual property. And imitation has its limits. [Few
in Europe and Asia have forgotten that free-market economies were
democracy's greatest weapon in the 20th century, and the entrepreneurs
and investors that drive those free markets won't soon embrace
authoritarian control.]{.underline} That goes double for the **[U.S.
Political life]{.underline}** here [has problems: money]{.underline} in
politics, [gerrymandering]{.underline}, rising [partisanship and a
President who calls the media]{.underline} an "[enemy]{.underline} of
the people" while musing about how "great" it must be for Chinese
President Xi Jinping to amass absolute power. Finding a voice to counter
that antidemocratic rhetoric is proving surprisingly hard, so far.
**[But does anyone seriously think we are headed toward authoritarian
control]{.underline}** of our politics or single-party rule? Speaking as
someone who was interviewed for possible positions by both Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump, I don't think so. [The **media** remain strong
and determined to tell the truth, and **the courts** remain rigorously
independent]{.underline}. [The Mueller investigation is clanking at the
President like a Panzer tank, and whatever it reveals, the nation will
deal with it through laws and politics. Accountability remains a core
driver in the national debate.]{.underline} We paint democracy as a
utopia, but it is not. It has been called, as Churchill noted, the worst
form of government except for all the others --- subject to abuse and
manipulation and often sclerotic. We must forgive its failings, and work
to improve them, as long as its core institutions further civil rights,
guarantee rule of law and are subject to the will of the people. There
will be losses in all of these nations, as well as our own, corruption,
misbehavior, pressure on the courts and media. Challenges will only grow
as change in this century continues at a blistering pace. But [for every
example of democracy fading]{.underline} out or finding itself under
attack, [there are **counterexamples**]{.underline} of democracy and
democratic activists moving forward and finding solutions. Under this
U.S. Administration, there is little leadership on global human rights
or democratic norms. But other leaders, from Angela [Merkel]{.underline}
and Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} of Europe to Shinzo [Abe]{.underline}
of Japan to Justin [Trudeau]{.underline} of Canada, [have been outspoken
in defense of democratic values.]{.underline} Change is happening in
smaller nations as well. And [democracy will prevail not because of
individual leaders but because it is better than authoritarianism at
meeting the challenges of governing. Human nature abhors a boss, and
politically, democracy serves as a safety valve.]{.underline} Look to
America, even in its current rage. [We cannot imagine our own nation
without the ability to switch from]{.underline} George W.
[Bush]{.underline}, a Republican fighting unpopular wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, [to]{.underline} Barack [Obama]{.underline}. [Or, for that
matter, to move from Obama to]{.underline} President
[Trump]{.underline}. [Those shifts]{.underline} may look like stark
division on the surface. But they also [represent democracy's ability to
allow dissenting, frustrated views an outlet]{.underline}. Dictators may
impose order, but mounting unrest as often as not turns them out,
frequently with disastrous results. Some of the worst massacres in
modern history have followed the ouster of strongmen. Sometimes
democracy will not resolve complex events, or most effectively use
technology, or respond speedily. But it peacefully holds accountable
leaders who don't fulfill their promises or better our lives, and
rewards those who do. That has proved more valuable in the long run than
more immediate urges[. Two hundred years ago, there was a mere handful
of pseudo democracies in the world. At]{.underline} the turn of the 20th
century, a couple of dozen democracies existed. Today, [despite the
continuation of Chinese and Russian authoritarian regimes, there are
**well over a hundred**]{.underline}. [Hundreds of millions have
transitioned from fully authoritarian monarchies]{.underline}
(throughout Europe, Central Asia and parts of East Asia) [and pure
dictatorships]{.underline} (Latin America, the Balkans, the Levant and
parts of Africa). History has run from male-dominated tribes in the
Paleolithic era through dictatorial city-states to early modern
monarchies and today's democracies. We can all hope that [the battle to
defend democracy will be less costly in the 21st century than in the
previous one]{.underline}. We can enhance our chances of winning by
empowering women, boosting programs that fight economic inequality and
teaching our children the critical thinking skills they need to separate
truth from lies. Democracy's defenders can work to be clear what our
cause is, why it matters and what is at stake. Sometimes people say to
me that America is in a "war of ideas." Not quite. We remain in a
marketplace of ideas. That is what has made us most adaptable to new
threats and resilient in the face of challenges. It is also why we must
articulate our vision of the values that, while we execute them
imperfectly, are right and true.

### \-\-- XT: Democracy Resilient 

#### Global democracy resilient

**Muggah and Pinker 18** (Robert, Co-founder, Igarape Institute and
SecDev Group, and Steven, Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology,
Harvard University, "Democracy isn\'t in as much trouble as you might
think," 6-3-18,
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/is-liberal-democracy-in-retreat)

[Though some countries]{.underline} (and cities) [are faring worse than
others, [the world is **becoming safer**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark}nd more prosperous overall -- hard as that may be to believe.
[This is [especially]{.mark} true of [democratic
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, which stand out for their higher rates
of economic growth and higher levels of wellbeing. Democracies also tend
to have fewer wars and genocides, virtually no famines, and happier,
healthier, better-educated citizens. The good news is that [a sizeable
majority of the world's population now lives in a
democracy]{.underline}. Yet in some of them -- not least the United
States -- [[the rise of populist, nativist political parties and
leaders]{.mark} with authoritarian tendencies [has created a]{.mark}n
unmistakable [sense of pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading many to
fear for the future of democracy. Are people right to be worried?
Democratic sea change Many people forget that liberal democracy is a
relatively new idea. Most of its core precepts -- the separation of
powers, human rights, civil liberties, freedom of speech and assembly,
pluralistic media, and free, fair, and competitive elections -- did not
genuinely take hold until the twentieth century. Until a few hundred
years ago, most societies had swung between anarchy and various forms of
tyranny. Governments before the modern era brought about only marginal
improvements in the lives of their subjects, whom they often kept in
check through brutal repression. Ruthless despotism endured in most
places, because the alternative -- a Hobbesian state of anarchy -- was
even worse. The emergence of democracy was far from inevitable. In fact,
the spread of democratic governments after the eighteenth century was a
rather stop-start affair. According to the late Harvard University
political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, it came in three waves. The
first began in the nineteenth century, led by the US, which had
developed a system of constitutional democracy that was widely admired
for its checks on executive, legislative, and judicial power and
privilege. Throughout the nineteenth century, Western European
countries, in particular, emulated the US model. By 1922, there were
some 29 democracies in existence around the world, though that number
would fall to 12 by 1942. The second wave, according to Huntington, came
after the Allied victory in World War II, and crested in 1962, when
there were 36 democracies around the world. Again, the wave would ebb
somewhat. By 1975, the number had fallen to 30, owing to communist
takeovers and pushback from authoritarian regimes in Europe, Latin
America, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The third wave was
more of a tsunami. Military and fascist governments fell left, right,
and center throughout the 1970s and 1980s. After the fall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989 and the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1991, the number
of democracies worldwide effectively tripled. By the start of US
President Barack Obama's administration in 2009, there were 87
democracies worldwide. Marching backwards? Looking back, the immediate
post-Cold War period seems like a Golden Age of democratic
consolidation. But it was also a time when the staggering pace of change
fueled new concerns about the genuine health of many newly democratic
governments. Today, [confidence in the forward march of democracy is
dimming]{.underline}. [Scholars speak grimly of how democracies are
suffering from "undertow,"]{.underline} "rollback," "recession," and
even "depression." [Others worry that democracies are hollowing
themselves out and becoming "partial,"]{.underline} "low-intensity,"
"empty," and "illiberal." In these cases, elections still take place,
but civil liberties and checks on power are flouted. Moreover, [the
failure of the 2003-2005 "color revolutions" in Georgia, Ukraine, and
Kyrgyzstan were highly demoralizing]{.underline}, as was the failure of
the 2010-2011 Arab Spring in Egypt, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere in the
Middle East and North Africa. [Even more recently, authoritarian
governance in new democracies such as Hungary, Poland, and Turkey, and
in old democracies such as the US, have set off alarm
bells]{.underline}. And an unrelenting flood of negative headlines in
other democracies has reinforced the sense that illiberalism and
nationalist populism are resurgent. Watchdog groups such as Freedom
House are convinced that the world has become increasingly less free. A
spate of new books has added to the creeping sense of doom. In How
Democracies Die, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt of Harvard
University argue that democracies usually end not with a bang, but with
a whimper, as demagogues like President Donald Trump in the US gradually
undermine checks and balances. Likewise, in The People vs. Democracy,
Harvard's Yascha Mounk warns that liberal democracy is giving way to
"undemocratic liberalism" and "illiberal democracy." The former protects
basic rights but delegates real power to unelected technocratic bodies
like the European Commission. The latter features democratically elected
leaders who ignore minority rights. More generally, Mounk and others
fear that young people, including in the West, are turning away from
democracy. What the data show And yet [**[there is reason to doubt that
democracy is in retreat]{.mark}** around the world]{.underline}. For
starters, [[there is no]{.mark} clear [evidence of a dramatic decline in
support for democracy]{.mark} across most countries]{.underline},
including in the US. This does not mean that today's uptick in the
number of autocracies should be ignored; but it does suggest that the
elegies for democracy may be premature. [[Polls that show
declining]{.mark} global [support]{.mark} for democracy [should]{.mark}
also [be **interpreted with**]{.mark} **some
[skepticism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} After all, [it is hard to
discern people's appetite for democracy in countries ruled by
authoritarian regimes, where respondents must be careful about publicly
declaring such positions]{.underline}. In fact, [[research from the
**C**]{.mark}enter for **[S]{.mark}**ystemic **[P]{.mark}**eace's
**[P]{.mark}**olity **[P]{.mark}**roject [suggests]{.mark} that [the
**great third wave of democratization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [far from
receding]{.underline}, [[may]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually **[[give
way to a fourth wave]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As of 2015, the latest year
for which Polity Project data are available, there were 103 democracies
worldwide, accounting for over half of the global population. Add the 17
countries classified as more democratic than autocratic, and the share
of the population living in democracies increases to two-thirds. By
comparison, a mere 1% of the population lived in democratic countries in
the early 1800s. [Even when acknowledging that there are many shades of
democratic governance]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} statistic alone
[should give pause to democracy's doomsayers.]{.underline} To be sure,
[[the **resilience of democracy** must not become a source of
complacency]{.underline}]{.mark}. The continued spread of democratic
governance is far from guaranteed. When disaggregated by levels of
pluralism, political participation, and respect for civil liberties,
several democracies show unmistakable signs of backsliding. According to
the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, just 19 countries,
most of them in Western Europe, can be described as "full democracies,"
as opposed to "flawed democracies," "hybrid regimes," or "authoritarian
regimes." Of the 167 countries in the index, 89 registered signs of
deterioration in 2017 compared to the previous year. Among the countries
slipping toward authoritarianism are a few recent democratic converts
such as the so-called Visegrád Group: the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, and Slovakia. The Philippines, led by another illiberal
populist, Rodrigo Duterte, is steadily removing liberal constraints.
Some of the populist leaders in these countries have taken inspiration
from other elected strongmen, such as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey and
Vladimir Putin in Russia. These countries' experiences show that, while
democracy is still favored by most of the world, it is hardly the only
model of government. Likewise, theocracies in the Islamic world and
authoritarian capitalism in China offer alternatives that are attractive
to autocrats and populists because they can generate certain economic
advantages in the short term. Democracy\'s lasting promise Still, [[in
the face of]{.mark} all these **[existential threats]{.mark}**, it is
worth remembering that **[democracy has been so
successful]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[not just because of procedural
institutions]{.mark} such as elections or checks and
balances]{.underline}, despite how crucial these institutions are. It
could be, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, that despite its many flaws,
**[[democracy is still preferable to]{.mark} the
[alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Democracies, after all, allow
people to dismiss their representatives without resorting to bloodshed.

The killing of Khashoggi was certainly abhorrent, but [**ending U.S.

solution**]{.underline}. It [**risks dangerously conflating two separate
issues** and would **inevitably trigger unintended consequences** that
would undermine U.S. national security interests in the

Senators must remember that [Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in
Yemen]{.underline}. A [cutoff of U.S. support would also hurt the
elected and internationally recognized government of Yemen,]{.underline}
which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup
that violated a U.N.-brokered ceasefire.

[Withdrawing U**.S. support would also harm** the interests of other
U.S. **allies fighting in Yemen**, including the United Arab Emirates

[The war in Yemen is complex]{.underline}. Those who rush to blame Saudi
Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni [people ignore the war
crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis]{.underline}
to their opponents and the [ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting
the Houthi Ansar Allah]{.underline} ("Supporters of Allah") movement, a
Shia Islamist extremist group.

The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian
casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But [the Houthis should
not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly
sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles.]{.underline}

Ansar [Allah also deserves criticism for its violent role in
destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the current
humanitarian disaster]{.underline}. Ansar [Allah regularly attacks the
Saudi border, launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor
its own supporters and sell on the black market.]{.underline}

Ansar [Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied
nations, and civilian shipping in the Red Sea with Iranian-supplied
missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs.]{.underline} [**Undermining
the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating** this threat to
international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to threaten oil
shipments]{.underline} through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz.

[Those who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently
believe that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through
a **one-sided strategy** that **penalizes allies and boosts Ansar

[The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to fight this war
with or without U.S. support]{.underline}. Those who would connect two
unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and ignore Iran's hostile

#### We have to aid Saudi Arabia to end the war -- otherwise the Houthis and their allies will be much less likely to accept a cease fire or power share agreement

[In the case of Yemen, withdrawing U.S. support---which has largely
consisted of intelligence and logistical assistance---from the Saudis
will hinder the coalition's war effort and embolden the Houthis and
their Iranian supporters, making them much less likely to accept a
nationwide cease-fire and a power-sharing agreement.]{.underline}

[In fact, U.S. congressional criticism of the Saudis has already
encouraged the Houthis who, far from giving up, appear determined to
fight on.]{.underline} Since the UN brokered a cease-fire for the
strategically important, Houthi-held port of Hodeidah in December, the
Houthis have energetically fortified their positions in the city, in
direct violation of the agreement's terms. In fact, the Houthis have
defaulted on one withdrawal deadline after another---first in early
January, then in mid-February, thereby reneging on explicit commitments
to the UN.

UN negotiators are now trying to implement a third plan to move Houthi
forces out of Hodeidah and other Red Sea ports, and for both sides to
then pull back from the frontlines in Hodeidah city. But unless the
Houthis are given a powerful incentive to step back, there is little
reason to expect they will do so.

[Rather than produce a stalemate, cutting U.S. support for the Saudi-led
coalition might enable the Houthis to win a military victory, much like
the one the Assad regime, Iran, and Russia are slowly achieving in
Syria. This outcome is hardly desirable. The Houthis are anti-American,
anti-Semitic, and increasingly anti-Sunni. In fact, Houthis, who are of
Zaydi Shiite faith, are just one clan of hundreds in the
country.]{.underline} There is no historical or popular basis for the
Houthis to rule the capital, Sanaa, or the ports. As a result, [a
post-conflict Yemen under Houthi rule would likely require considerable
repression to hold it in place.]{.underline}

#### They can't solve --- The US alone ceasing arm sales to Saudi wouldn't be enough to stop the war

[The path to ending the war is clear. First, the United States and other
countries must cease arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The
Security Council should pass a resolution demanding an immediate end to
the war and compelling the Saudis and Emiratis to withdraw from
Yemen.]{.underline} The United Nations must sponsor a political process
that begins by obligating all parties to the conflict to disarm their
militias.

[This will allow Yemen to resume the political process that was
disrupted by the coup. The United Nations should oversee the formation
of government of national unity that will organize a referendum on the
draft constitution and prepare for fresh elections. It is crucial to
establish a national reconciliation commission responsible for providing
redress to victims of the war]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates must be held accountable and compensate Yemen for the
damages they have caused.

#### Plan encourages diversification of weapons Saudi is importing---including China. Saudi Arabia continues their arsenal sans US arms anyway.

**[Efforts by China and Russia to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia have had
limited success. However, the deliveries]{.underline}** of unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) **[from China since
2014]{.underline}**---while few in number and lower in capability
compared to the weapons delivered by the USA and the UK---**[are still
significant as they could mark the beginning of Saudi Arabia's efforts
to diversify the sourcing of its weapons beyond Western
countries.]{.underline}**

This **[diversification is likely to be driven by efforts to improve its
bargaining position on the arms market, to widen and deepen its
international political network and in order to minimize the effects of
the restrictive arms export policies of current supplier states on Saudi
Arabian arms procurement]{.underline}**. The latter has been of
increased relevance as a number of European states critical of Saudi
Arabia's use of military force in Yemen successively announced severe
restrictions on arms exports to the Kingdom. The Netherlands led the way
in early 2016 and by late 2018 Germany, Finland and Denmark had
followed. However, the main European arms exporters to Saudi Arabia
---such as the UK, France, Spain and Italy---have discussed such
restrictions but not implemented them.

### Turn -- Yemen

#### **The best strategy to stop the Yemen War is supporting Saudi -- disproves their theory.**

[In Washington, a growing chorus of analysts and politicians has called
on the United States to step up, withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi war
effort, and turn the UN-brokered cease-fire into a lasting
peace]{.underline}. Doing so, they argue, is the only morally and
strategically defensible course of action. [But of all the options
before the United States, this one is the least likely to stop the
killing, the dying, and the complications for U.S.
interests.]{.underline}

[The Saudi-led intervention]{.underline} may have exacerbated the
situation in Yemen, but it [did not start the war]{.underline}. Getting
the Saudis to pull out will no more end the bloodshed in Yemen than
getting the United States to abstain from the civil war in Syria halted
the violence there. [Nor will a Saudi withdrawal lead to a negotiated
settlement. Instead, the fighting will go on, and innocent Yemenis will
continue to die until one side---most likely the Houthis---have
won.]{.underline}

[True peace in Yemen will remain elusive]{.underline} unless both sides
accept that they have nothing to gain from more fighting. [We are not
there yet. To get there will require not cutting off U.S. support for
Saudi Arabia but threatening to double down on it unless the Houthis
honor their commitments to the UN]{.underline} and are ready to disgorge
most of their initial conquests. [If Washington is serious about ending
the war, it must come to terms with this uncomfortable
fact.]{.underline}

#### Even the signal of the plan emboldens the Houthis and keeps Yemen going.

[A negotiated settlement can end a war earlier and thus with less
bloodshed. But combatants generally don't agree]{.underline} to such
settlements [until]{.underline} they have reached a military stalemate
such that [all sides are convinced they cannot win a military
victory]{.underline}. Even then, [the warring parties need to know that
they can disarm without being slaughtered]{.underline}---a condition
that can sometimes be met only with an outside peacekeeping commitment
for a decade or more. And once the parties have come to the table, [any
successful negotiated settlement will have to include a power-sharing
arrangement]{.underline} that grants all factions political power and
economic benefits roughly commensurate with their demographic weight
(adjusted for military realities).

[In the case of Yemen, withdrawing U.S. support]{.underline}---which has
largely consisted of intelligence and logistical assistance---[from the
Saudis will hinder the coalition's war effort and embolden the Houthis
and their Iranian supporters, making them much less likely to accept a
nationwide cease-fire and a power-sharing agreement.]{.underline}

## AT: Diversion

### 1NC Diversion Inevitable 

#### Diversion inevitable due to fill in, ending sales worse

**Fox News 6-14-**19

(https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-weapons-wrong-hands-iran-saudi-arabia-yemen-proxy-war)

Jim [Phillips, a research fellow for]{.underline} Middle Eastern Affairs
at The [Heritage]{.underline} Foundation [acknowledged that while
U.S]{.underline}.-made vehicles and [arms have been captured by the
Houthi rebels]{.underline} in battle, [the greater worry is the "illegal
transfer to the Houthis of Iranian arms including rockets, armed drones,
and ballistic missiles which have been used to attack civilian
targets."]{.underline} "[Iranian arms transfers]{.underline}, which are
illegal under multiple UN Security Council resolutions, [pose a much
greater threat than U.S. arms to civilians in Yemen and
elsewhere]{.underline} on the Arabian Peninsula," he said. [Phillips
pointed out that other non-state actors]{.underline}, who are
anti-Western but have taken up the task of fighting the Iran-linked
Houthis, [have benefited from a "leakage" of U.S.-supplied
arms]{.underline}. "The U.S. needs to make sure that Saudi and UAE
military forces that have bought such arms are not transferring them in
violation of their end-use requirements," he said, but stressed that
ultimately [he did not believe that U.S. arms are perpetuating the
calamitous war.]{.underline} The Trump team has staunchly defended the
controversial arms sale by advocating that Arab allies need to be able
to defend themselves against the growing threat of Iran, along with the
bonus of bolstering the U.S economy in terms of money and jobs for the
defense industry. "[If such arms were cut off, the Yemeni government,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE would continue to fight the Iran-backed
Houthis,]{.underline} who continue to attack civilian targets in those
countries with increasingly sophisticated Iranian-supplied weapons,"
Philips noted. "Those governments would continue fighting to protect
themselves, [but with arms imported from Russia or China, instead of the
U.S., that could pose greater threats to Yemeni civilians."]{.underline}

### 2NC Diversion Inevitable

#### Aff doesn't solve--- the UAE and Saudi Arabia would just divert South African arms to militias in Yemen

Kiri **Rupiah**, **February 6,** 2019, \"Amnesty report says SA arms
diverted to Yemeni militia,\" M&G Online,
<https://mg.co.za/article/2019-02-06-00-amnesty-report-says-sa-arms-diverted-to-yemeni-militia>
//EN

An investigation published by Amnesty International on Wednesday
suggests [South African arms sold to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are
being diverted to militias accused of war crimes in Yemen.]{.underline}

Titled "When arms go astray: Yemen's deadly new threat of arms diversion
to militias," the investigation details how the [UAE has become a major
conduit for armoured vehicles, mortar systems, rifles, pistols, and
machine guns --- which are being illicitly diverted to militias accused
of war crimes and other serious violations.]{.underline}

Yemen has been at war since late 2014, when Houthi rebels --- allied
with troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh --- captured
much of the country, including the capital, Sana'a. The Houthis are said
to be backed by Iran, Saudi Arabia's nemesis in the region.

In March 2015, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition launched an aerial bombing
campaign which was followed by ground incursions against the rebels in a
bid to restore the internationally recognised government of President
Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Despite the humanitarian destruction the war has wrought[, South African
weapons companies have continued to supply Saudi Arabia and its allies
with weapons for a campaign that according to the United Nations has
been characterised by human rights violations, including war crimes.
Between 2016 and 2017 alone, South African companies sold arms worth
more than R3-billion to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.]{.underline}

The National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), the South
African authority that oversees arms exports and regulates South African
weapons companies, has been accused of laxity when it comes to ensuring
that local arms dealers comply with its regulations.

According to Defenceweb[, in 2014 South Africa concluded a major
contract for Yemeni-assembled armoured vehicles and delivered four
artillery systems to Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

[South African artillery and military hardware, including the G6
howitzer made by Denel, have been sighted on Yemeni
battlefields. \]{.underline}
In July 2015, footage appeared to show a Denel-made Seeker II drone shot
down over Yemen.

Huthis, a new threat is emerging.

As the ground war evolves, **[weapons are not only being used by UAE
forces in Yemen, but are also being passed on to completely

diverted similar military equipment**, such as vehicles, to
unaccountable UAE-backed militias.]{.underline}

Amnesty International has previously verified the use of [French-
supplied CAESAR truck-mounted Howitzers on the border between Saudi
Arabia and Yemen.]{.underline}

According to
the [UN](https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24373&LangID=E),
there has been [a surge in hostilities in governorates bordering Saudi
Arabia that has led to an increase in civilian casualties in the past
three months and an influx of [internally displaced
people](https://www.globaldtm.info/yemen-displacement-report-round-37-march-2019/)]{.underline}.
According to the Civilian Impact Monitoring Project, border districts in
northern Yemen and areas in and around Hodeidah have been the most
heavily impacted by daily artillery fire that has hit houses and farms.
So far in 2019, shelling has caused 62% of damage to civilian properties
in Sa'da alone, while air strikes have been responsible for 27%.

[An Abu al-Abbas commander in Taiz showed the investigators grenades the

[grenades were part of a consignment delivered to the UAE
i]{.underline}n 2003.

In February this year militias fighting for an independent state in
Yemen's south raised the South Yemen flag on US-made armoured vehicles,
the BAE Caiman Mrap. The same southern resistance later joined forces
with the UAE-backed Giants Brigade and received dozens of US-made
MaxxPro armoured vehicles. [In 2014 the UAE spent \$2.5bn (£1.95bn) on
1150 Caiman and 3360 MaxxPro vehicles from the US.]{.underline} This
deal included a technology protection clause and end user certificate.
[The supplier of Caimans in this case was UK-based BAE Systems, although
the contract was procured via its subsidiary in Texas.]{.underline}

[The vehicles have been sighted on numerous occasions on all sides of
the conflict, leading to Yemeni army officials' complaints of being less
well equipped than the resistance groups.]{.underline}

Last month a video released by the [Houthis depicted arms seized from
the Giants]{.underline} Brigade[. Among the spoils were the Swiss
grenades.]{.underline}

Ahmed Himmiche, coordinator of the Security Council Panel of Experts on
Yemen, said: "We learned from sources that [some Yemeni fighters had
sold their weapons, especially when they did not receive
wages."]{.underline}

He [said battlefield weapons leaking into domestic arms markets
increased the terror attack risk globally.]{.underline}

Monitoring the [black market]{.underline}, Himmiche said [prices were
stable or declining despite the increased demand due to war: a clear and
worrying indicator that diversion into the black market was
rising,]{.underline} because of the resulting glut that reduced prices.

#### A coordinated embargo key to squeeze Saudi Arabia -- \*this could be used as an answer for the human rights stuff 

**Caverley 18 (Jonathan D., 10/12/18, associate professor at the United
States Naval War College and a research scientist at M.I.T., "Want to
Punish Saudi Arabia? Cut Off Its Weapons Supply", The New York,**
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)>

Saudi Arabia is in the middle of a major war, and more than 60 percent
of its arms deliveries over the past five years came from the United
States. The Saudi military relies not just on American tanks, planes and
missiles but for a daily supply of maintenance, training and support,
such as intelligence and refueling[. In the longer term, almost all of
Saudi Arabia's remaining exports come from Europe. To truly squeeze
Saudi Arabia, a coordinated embargo --- much like the one now in place
against Russia --- would be necessary but relatively easy.]{.underline}
European governments already feel strong domestic political pressure not
to export to regimes like Saudi Arabia.

#### Isis will steal arms sold to Iraq

//EN

Spleeters is a field investigator for Conflict Armament Research (CAR),
an international organization funded by the European Union that
documents [weapon]{.underline}s [trafficking in war zones]{.underline}.
He is 31 years old, with a 1980s Freddie Mercury mustache and tattoos
covering thin arms that tan quickly in the desert sun. In another
context, he'd be mistaken for a hipster barista, not an investigator who
has spent the past three years tracking down rocket-­propelled grenades
in Syria, AK-47-style rifles in Mali, and [hundreds of]{.underline}
other [weapons]{.underline} [that have found their way into war
zones,]{.underline} sometimes in violation of international arms
agreements. The work Spleeters does is typically undertaken by secretive
government offices, such as the US Defense Intelligence Agency's
Military Material Identification Division, known as Chuckwagon. But
while Chuckwagon is barely discoverable by Google, Spleeters' detailed
reports for CAR are both publicly available online and contain more
useful information than any classified intelligence I ever received when
I was commanding a bomb disposal unit for the US military in Iraq in
2006.

In that fight, guerrillas ambushed American soldiers with IEDs. The
devices I saw during my tours were largely hidden in the ground or
deployed as massive car bombs, detonated in marketplaces and schools so
that the gutters filled with blood. But the majority of those devices
were crude, held together with duct tape and goopy solder. The few
rockets and mortars the fighters possessed were old and shoddy, lacked
the correct fuzes, and often failed to detonate.

[Many of ISIS' leaders were veterans of]{.underline} that
i[nsurgency]{.underline}, but as they began [ramping up their war
against the Iraqi government]{.underline} in 2014, they knew they needed
more than IEDs and AK-47s to seize territory and create their
independent Islamic State. [A conventional war required conventional
arms---mortars, rockets, grenades---which, as an international pariah,
ISIS could not buy in sufficient quantities. Some they looted from the
Iraqi or Syrian governments,]{.underline} but when those ran out they
did something that no terrorist group has ever done before and that they
continue to do today: design their own munitions and mass-produce them
using advanced manufacturing techniques. Iraq's oil fields provided the
industrial base---tool-and-die sets, high-end saws, injection-­molding
machines---and skilled workers who knew how to quickly fashion intricate
parts to spec. Raw materials came from cannibalizing steel pipe and
melting down scrap. ISIS engineers forged new fuzes, new rockets and
launchers, and new bomblets to be dropped by drones, all assembled using
instruction plans drawn up by ISIS officials.

Since the early days of the conflict, CAR has conducted 83 site visits
in Iraq to collect weapons data, and Spleeters has participated in
nearly every investigation[. The result is a detailed database that
lists 1,832 weapons and 40,984 pieces of ammunition recovered in Iraq
and Syria. CAR describes it as "the most comprehensive ­sample of Islamic
State--captured weapons and ammunition to date."]{.underline}

#### Weapons sold got lost in Iraq and Afghanistan

C. J. **Chivers**, 8-24-20**16**, \"How Many Guns Did the U.S. Lose
Track of in Iraq and Afghanistan? Hundreds of Thousands.,\" New York
Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/magazine/how-many-guns-did-the-us-lose-track-of-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-hundreds-of-thousands.htmlHow
Many Guns Did the U.S. Lose Track of in Iraq and Afghanistan? Hundreds
of Thousands. //EN

Was this a surprise? No. A little [more than four years after the United
States withdrew all its military forces from Iraq]{.underline}, and not
quite two years after a smaller number of American troops began
returning to the country to help fight the Islamic State, [the open sale
of such an M4 was part of Iraq's day-to-day arms-trafficking routine.
M]{.underline}ahyawi's carbine was another data point attesting to an
extraordinary and dangerous failure of American arms-trafficking and
public accountability and to a departure from a modern military's most
basic practice: keeping track of the guns.

Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, [the United States has handed out
a vast but persistently uncountable quantity of military firearms to its
many battlefield partners in Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}. [Today
the Pentagon has only a partial idea of how many weapons it issued, much
less where these weapons are]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the effectively
bottomless abundance of black-market weapons from American sources is
one reason Iraq will not recover from its post-invasion woes anytime
soon.

An inkling of just how expansive these arms transfers were, and how
stubbornly resistant they are to precise measurement, is apparent in a
new attempt at weapons-tallying compiled in a project led by Iain
Overton. Overton is a former BBC journalist who is now the executive
director of Action on Armed Violence, a charity based in London that
researches and lobbies against weapons proliferation and violence
against civilians; he is also the author of "The Way of the Gun," a dark
examination of some of the roles firearms play in modern society. With a
string of Freedom of Information Act requests that began last year, he
and his small team of researchers pooled 14 years' worth of Pentagon
contract information related to rifles, pistols, machine guns and their
associated attachments and ammunition, both for American troops and for
their partners and proxies. They then crosschecked the data against
other public records. Overton is releasing the data and his analysis
today. It covers 412 contracts and merits pause for reflection as the
parties to the international Arms Trade Treaty gather this week in
Geneva. The treaty, which took effect in 2014 and of which the United
States is a signatory, is intended to promote transparency and
responsible action in the transfer of conventional arms and to reduce
their diversion to unintended hands --- exactly what the United States
often failed to do in recent wars.

In all, Overton found, the Pentagon provided more than 1.45 million
firearms to various security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, including
more than 978,000 assault rifles, 266,000 pistols and almost 112,000
machine guns. These transfers formed a collage of firearms of mixed
vintage and type: Kalashnikov assault rifles left over from the Cold
War; recently manufactured NATO-standard M16s and M4s from American
factories; machine guns of Russian and Western lineage; and sniper
rifles, shotguns and pistols of varied provenance and caliber, including
a large order of Glock semiautomatic pistols, a type of weapon also
regularly offered for sale online in Iraq.

Many of the recipients of these weapons became brave and important
battlefield allies. But many more did not. Taken together, the [weapons
were part of a vast and sometimes minimally supervised flow of arms from
a superpower to armies and militias often compromised by poor training,
desertion, corruption and patterns of human rights abuses]{.underline}.
Knowing what we know about many of these forces, it would have been
remarkable for them to retain custody of many of their weapons. It is
not surprising that they did not.

As an illustration of how haphazard the supervision of this arms
distribution often was, last week, five months after being asked by The
New York Times for its own tally of small arms issued to partner forces
in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon said it has records for fewer than
half the number of firearms in the researchers' count --- about 700,000
in all. This is an amount, Overton noted, that "only accounts for 48
percent of the total small arms supplied by the U.S. government that can
be found in open-source government reports."

This gap between the tallies, the Pentagon said, is partly because at
first the United States military was trying to stand up to two
governments that were busily fighting wars. "Speed was essential in
getting those nations' security forces armed, equipped and trained to
meet these extreme challenges," Mark Wright, a Pentagon spokesman, wrote
in an email. "As a result, lapses in accountability of some of the
weapons transferred occurred." Wright also said that the Pentagon's
current practices have improved, and that to ensure "that equipment is
only used for authorized purposes," its representatives "inventory each
weapon as it arrives in country and record the distribution of the
weapon to the foreign partner nation."

Why counting weapons, and making a record of serial numbers and
recipients, was seen as so time-consuming that it would have slowed down
war is not clear. Anyone who has served in a military unit knows that
documenting who received what weapon is both a fundamental task and a
habit that fits easily into a routine. It takes no more time than
issuing a uniform to a soldier or feeding him a meal. But often the
Pentagon did not require these steps --- although Wright noted that once
a weapon is provided to another force, "It is their responsibility to
account for that weapon."

#### The US can't track lost weapons sold to Iraq because of the Iraqi military

Max J. **Rosenthal**, 1-22-20**16**, \[Max J. Rosenthal was a reporter
at the Mother Jones DC bureau covering national security and
surveillance, \"The Pentagon has no clue how many weapons it has lost to

<https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/why-iraq-black-hole-american-arms/>
//EN

For more than a decade, [the United States has supplied huge quantities
of weapons and military hardware to the Iraqi government---and a large
chunk of that equipment has disappeared and landed in the hands of ISIS
fighters and [members of Iranian-backed Shiite
militias](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-08/iranbacked-militias-are-getting-us-weapons-in-iraq) responsible
for massacring civilians]{.underline}. [Everything from M-16s and
bullets to Humvees and tanks have been lost. But neither the US nor
Iraqi governments can say how much US-supplied materiel has been
diverted to militant groups or how it's ending up there.]{.underline}

[Losing weapons to extremists and insurgents]{.underline} has long been
a problem for the US military and the Iraqi army, but it [became more
urgent]{.underline} after ISIS seized chunks of Iraq in 2014,
overrunning Iraqi troops and sweeping up their weapons. With that
equipment, ISIS solidified its hold on its captured territory and drew
the United States back into Iraq. Still, [the Pentagon has not been able
to monitor the loss of its weapons and other supplies to ISIS.
"]{.underline}The bottom line is that the US military does not have a
means to track equipment that has been taken from the Government of Iraq
by ISIL," Commander Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman,
wrote in an email to Mother Jones, using the government's preferred
acronym for ISIS.

It's not supposed to work this way. "The US does place a lot of
restrictions---in theory---on \[arms\] transfers," says Patrick Wilcken
of Amnesty International, who worked on [a recent report on ISIS's
weaponry](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/). If
the United States wants to provide arms to another country, the
Department of Defense is required by law to obtain assurances that the
weapons will be secured. There's a Pentagon organization called the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency that carries out and monitors these
arms shipments and makes sure the weapons are being used for their
intended purposes. And a 2013 UN treaty bars the United States from
providing arms to countries where weapons could end up with armed groups
committing human rights violations. But despite these mechanisms,
[significant amounts of US-supplied arms]{.underline}---including
rifles, pistols, and ammunition---[are still going missing, largely
thanks to the Iraqi military's patchwork supply system.]{.underline}

[The source of the problem is]{.underline} no mystery: [the Iraqi
military. It]{.underline} keeps tabs on its weapons only through what
Wilcken describes as "scraps of paper." In September, the Pentagon's
inspector general [issued a
report](http://www.dodig.mil/pubs/documents/DODIG-2015-177.pdf) noting
that the Iraqi army lacked any sort of supply database and instead
relied on "a manual, paper-based system for tracking supplies and
equipment." That report came eight years after the Government
Accountability Office found in 2007 that nearly 200,000
US-supplied [weapons went unaccounted
for](http://www.gao.gov/assets/270/264918.pdf) in Iraq, due [to shoddy
recordkeeping by the Iraqi army and the US-led coalition. The GAO
couldn't tell where those weapons went, but many probably landed in the
hands of jihadists. Wilcken's report found that a "substantial portion"
of ISIS's weapons come from Iraqi army stocks.]{.underline}

"Many developing states have no post-delivery controls \[for weapons\]
in place, or have poor mechanisms for applying the controls which
exist," says N.R. Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research
Services, a consultancy that tracks global arms trade. "Weapons
delivered to such countries can be subject to limited oversight at best,
often quickly slipping 'outside the system' in a conflict situation."

This issue of the Iraqi military losing control of US-supplied weapons
has not attracted much congressional attention, at least not publicly.
The House and Senate foreign relations committees have jurisdiction over
arms sales, but neither has held a hearing on the topic in the past two
years. A Republican aide on the Senate committee says staff members have
received briefings on Iraq's arms storage problems, but he would not
discuss the details of these briefings or say when they had occurred.

[By shipping arms to Iraq despite these problem, the US government risks
violating both domestic and international law.]{.underline} The Arms
Export Control Act of 1976 says the United States [can only provide
weapons](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2753) to partners
who "will provide substantially the same degree of security protection
afforded to such article or service by the United States Government."
For example, the US military keeps its M-16 rifles locked in an armory,
and it tracks each gun by the serial number. If an M-16 is supplied to
Iraq, both the Iraqi army and the Pentagon are responsible for
monitoring it. And as part of the US monitoring process, American
inspectors are supposed to visit Iraqi supply depots to make sure the
Iraqi army is securing its weapons and ensuring the arms are only used
by its own soldiers.

Yet the Pentagon inspector general's report says that's not happening.
US personnel "at the Taji National Depot did not have accurate knowledge
of the contents of individual supply warehouses under Iraqi control at
that location or at other supply locations throughout Iraq," the report
states. The IG investigation also found that Iraqi officers refused to
grant American advisers access to most weapons storage facilities. So
[in addition to the US military not being able to tell how many of its
weapons have been obtained by ISIS or other jihadi groups, no one in the
Iraqi or American governments can keep accurate track of what the Iraqi
army has in its possession in the first place.]{.underline}

**[Flood of US weapons in Afghanistan and Pakistan fueling militant
groups, experts say]{.underline}**

PESHAWAR, Pakistan --- [Some of the U.S. weapons bound for U.S. and
Afghan troops in Afghanistan are being stolen, landing instead in the
hands of those they are meant to be used against, and fueling militant
groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan]{.underline}, Pakistani
officials say.

[These weapons]{.underline} --- which are typically snatched from Afghan
troops during raids or sold by them to the Pakistani Taliban after they
defect, [are easily available in black markets]{.underline} in
Pakistan\'s tribal regions.

[Some]{.underline} weapons, along with other military-issue supplies,
[are also being seized by Taliban militants in attacks on
NATO]{.underline} convoys passing through Pakistan on their way to
resuply soldiers in Afghanistan. Although such raids have been [taking

as well, including in the capital of Islamabad [as recently as June

### 1NC No Terror Impact

No risk of nuclear terror

**[Mueller 10]{.underline}** (John, professor of political science at
Ohio State, Calming Our Nuclear Jitters, Issues in Science and
Technology, Winter, <http://www.issues.org/26.2/mueller.html>)

[[Politicians]{.mark} of all stripes [preach]{.mark} to an
anxious]{.underline}, appreciative, and very numerous [choir when they,
like]{.underline} President [Obama, proclaim atomic
terrorism]{.underline} to be "[the most immediate]{.underline} and
extreme [threat]{.underline} to global security." It is the problem
that, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, currently keeps every
senior leader awake at night. [This is hardly a new
anxiety]{.underline}. In 1946, atomic bomb maker J. Robert
[Oppenheimer]{.underline} ominously [warned that]{.underline} if three
or four men could smuggle in units for [an atomic bomb]{.underline},
they [could blow up New York. This]{.underline} [was an early expression
of a pattern of [dramatic risk inflation]{.mark}]{.underline} that has
persisted throughout the nuclear age. In fact, although expanding fires
and fallout might increase the effective destructive radius, [the blast
of [a Hiroshima-size device would "blow up]{.mark}]{.underline}" about
[[1% of the city]{.mark}'s area]{.underline}---a tragedy, of course, but
not the same as one 100 times greater. In the early 1970s, nuclear
physicist Theodore Taylor proclaimed the atomic terrorist problem to be
"immediate," explaining at length "how comparatively easy it would be to
steal nuclear material and step by step make it into a bomb." At the
time he thought it was already too late to "prevent the making of a few
bombs, here and there, now and then," or "in another ten or fifteen
years, it will be too late." Three decades after Taylor, [we continue to
wait for terrorists to carry out their "easy" task]{.underline}. [In
contrast to]{.underline} these [predictions, [terrorist
groups]{.mark}]{.underline} seem to [[have exhibited]{.mark} only
[limited desire and]{.mark} even less [progress]{.mark} in going
atomic]{.underline}. This may be because, after brief exploration of the
possible routes, they, unlike generations of alarmists, have discovered
that [the tremendous effort required is scarcely likely to be
successful]{.underline}. The most plausible route for terrorists,
according to most experts, would be to manufacture an atomic device
themselves from purloined fissile material (plutonium or, more likely,
highly enriched uranium). This task, however, remains a daunting one,
requiring that a considerable series of difficult hurdles be conquered
and in sequence. Outright [[armed theft]{.mark} of fissile material [is
exceedingly unlikely]{.mark} not only because of the resistance of
guards, but because [chase would be immediate]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
more promising approach would be to corrupt insiders to smuggle out the
required substances. However, [this requires the terrorists to pay off a
host of greedy confederates]{.underline}, including brokers and
money-transmitters, [any one of whom could turn on them or]{.underline},
either out of guile or incompetence, [furnish them with stuff that is
useless]{.underline}. Insiders might also consider the possibility that
once the heist was accomplished, the terrorists would, as analyst Brian
Jenkins none too delicately puts it, "have every incentive to cover
their trail, beginning with eliminating their confederates." [If
terrorists were somehow successful at obtaining]{.underline} a
sufficient mass of [relevant material, [they would]{.mark}]{.underline}
then probably [[have to transport it a long distance over unfamiliar
terrain]{.underline}]{.mark} and probably [while being pursued by
security forces]{.underline}. Crossing international borders would be
facilitated by following established [smuggling routes]{.underline}, but
these [are not as chaotic as they appear and are]{.underline} often
[under the watch of suspicious and careful criminal
regulators]{.underline}. If border personnel became suspicious of the
commodity being smuggled, some of them might find it in their interest
to disrupt passage, perhaps to collect the bounteous reward money that
would probably be offered by alarmed governments once the uranium theft
had been discovered. [Once outside the country]{.underline} with their
precious booty, [[terrorists would need]{.mark} to set up [a large and
well-equipped machine shop]{.mark} to manufacture a bomb [and]{.mark}
then to populate it with a very select team of [highly skilled
scientists]{.mark}]{.underline}, technicians, machinists, and
administrators. [The group would have to be assembled and retained for
the monumental task while no consequential suspicions were
generated]{.underline} among friends, family, and police about their
curious and sudden absence from normal pursuits back home. [Members of
the bomb-building team]{.underline} would also have to be utterly
devoted to the cause, of course, and they [would have to be willing to
put their lives]{.underline} and certainly their careers [at high
risk]{.underline}, because after their bomb was discovered or exploded
they would probably become the targets of an intense worldwide dragnet
operation. Some observers have insisted that it would be easy for
terrorists to assemble a crude bomb if they could get enough fissile
material. But Christoph Wirz and Emmanuel Egger, two senior physicists
in charge of nuclear issues at Switzerland's Spiez Laboratory, bluntly
conclude that [the task "could hardly be accomplished by a subnational
group]{.underline}." They point out that [[precise blueprints are
required]{.underline}]{.mark}, not just sketches and general ideas, and
that [even with a good blueprint the terrorist group would]{.underline}
most certainly [be forced to redesign]{.underline}. They also stress
that [the work is difficult, dangerous, and extremely
exacting]{.underline}, and that the [[technical
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark} in several fields [[verge on the
unfeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Stephen Younger, former director of
nuclear weapons research at Los Alamos Laboratories, has made a similar
argument, pointing out that [uranium is "exceptionally difficult to
machine]{.underline}" whereas "[plutonium is one of the most complex
metals ever discovered]{.underline}, a material whose basic properties
are sensitive to exactly how it is processed." Stressing the "daunting
problems associated with material purity, machining, and a host of other
issues," Younger concludes, "[to think that a terrorist group, working
in isolation with an unreliable supply of electricity and little access
to tools and supplies" could fabricate a bomb "is farfetched at
best]{.underline}." [Under the best circumstances,]{.underline} [[the
process]{.mark} of making a bomb [could take]{.mark}]{.underline} months
or even [[a year]{.mark} or more]{.underline}, [which
would]{.underline}, of course, [have to be carried out in utter
secrecy]{.underline}. In addition, people in the area, including
criminals, may observe with increasing curiosity and puzzlement the
constant coming and going of technicians unlikely to be locals. [If the
effort to build a bomb was successful, the finished product, weighing a
ton]{.underline} or more, [would then have to be transported to and
smuggled into the relevant target country where it would have to be
received by collaborators who are]{.underline} at once [totally
dedicated and technically proficient]{.underline} at handling,
maintaining, detonating, and perhaps assembling the weapon after it
arrives. [The financial costs]{.underline} of this extensive and
extended operation [could]{.underline} easily [become monumental. There
would be expensive equipment to buy, smuggle, and set up and people to
pay or pay off]{.underline}. Some operatives might work for free out of
utter dedication to the cause, but the [vast conspiracy]{.underline}
also [requires]{.underline} the subversion of [a considerable array of
criminals]{.underline} and opportunists, [each of whom has every
incentive to push the price for cooperation as high as
possible]{.underline}. Any criminals competent and capable enough to be
effective allies are also likely to be both smart enough to see
boundless opportunities for extortion and psychologically equipped by
their profession to be willing to exploit them. Those who warn about the
likelihood of a terrorist bomb contend that a terrorist group could, if
with great difficulty, overcome each obstacle and that doing so in each
case is "not impossible." But [although it may not be impossible to
surmount each individual step, the likelihood that a group could
surmount a series of them quickly becomes vanishingly
small]{.underline}. Table 1 attempts to catalogue the barriers that must
be overcome under the scenario considered most likely to be successful.
In contemplating the task before them, would-be [atomic
terrorists]{.underline} would effectively be required to go though an
exercise that looks much like this. If and when they do, they [will
undoubtedly conclude that their prospects are]{.underline} daunting and
accordingly uninspiring or even [terminally dispiriting]{.underline}. It
is possible to calculate the chances for success. [[Adopting]{.mark}
probability estimates that]{.underline} purposely and [heavily
[bias]{.mark}]{.underline} the case [[in the terrorists'
favor]{.underline}]{.mark}---for example, assuming the terrorists have a
50% chance of overcoming each of the 20 obstacles---the chances that a
concerted effort would be successful comes out to be less than one in a
million. If one assumes, somewhat more realistically, that their chances
at each barrier are one in three, [[the cumulative odds]{.mark} that
they will be able to pull off the deed [drop to one in]{.mark} well over
[three billion]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Other routes]{.underline} would-be
[terrorists might take to acquire a bomb are even more problematic.
[They are unlikely to be]{.mark} given or [sold a
bomb]{.mark}]{.underline} by a generous like-minded nuclear state for
delivery abroad [because the risk would be high]{.underline}, even for a
country led by extremists, [that the bomb (and its source) would be
discovered]{.underline} even before delivery or that it would be
exploded in a manner and on a target the donor would not approve,
including on the donor itself. Another concern would be that [the
terrorist group might be infiltrated by foreign
intelligence]{.underline}. [[The terrorist]{.mark} group
[might]{.mark}]{.underline} also seek to [[steal]{.mark} or illicitly
purchase [a "loose nuke]{.mark}]{.underline}" somewhere. However, it
seems probable that [**[none exist]{.mark}**. All governments have an
intense interest in controlling any weapons on their
territory]{.underline} because of fears that they might become the
primary target. Moreover, as technology has developed, [finished [bombs
have]{.mark} been out-fitted with [devices that]{.mark}]{.underline}
trigger a non-nuclear explosion that [[destroy]{.mark}s [the bomb if it
is tampered with]{.mark}. And there are other security
techniques]{.underline}: Bombs can be kept disassembled with the
component parts stored in separate high-security vaults, and a process
can be set up in which two people and [[multiple codes are
required]{.mark} not only to use the bomb but to store, maintain, and
deploy it]{.underline}. As Younger points out, "only a few people in the
world have the knowledge to cause an unauthorized detonation of a
nuclear weapon." There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge
[[if a nuclear state were to]{.mark} utterly
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}; Pakistan is frequently cited in this
context and sometimes North Korea as well. However, even under such
conditions, [nuclear [weapons would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably
[[remain under heavy guard]{.underline}]{.mark} by people who know that
a purloined bomb might be used in their own territory. [[They would
still have locks and]{.mark}, in]{.underline} the case of [Pakistan, the
weapons would [be disassembled]{.mark}]{.underline}. The al Qaeda factor
[The degree to which al Qaeda]{.underline}, the only terrorist group
that seems to want to target the United States, [has pursued or even has
much interest in a nuclear weapon may have been
exaggerated]{.underline}. The 9/11 Commission stated that "al Qaeda has
tried to acquire or make nuclear weapons for at least ten years," but
the only substantial evidence it supplies comes from an episode that is
supposed to have taken place about 1993 in Sudan, when al Qaeda members
may have sought to purchase some uranium that turned out to be bogus.
Information about this supposed venture apparently comes entirely from
Jamal al Fadl, who defected from al Qaeda in 1996 after being caught
stealing \$110,000 from the organization. Others, including the man who
allegedly purchased the uranium, assert that although there were various
other scams taking place at the time that may have served as grist for
Fadl, [the uranium episode never happened]{.underline}. As a key
indication of al Qaeda's desire to obtain atomic weapons, many have
focused on a set of conversations in Afghanistan in August 2001 that two
Pakistani nuclear scientists reportedly had with Osama bin Laden and
three other al Qaeda officials. Pakistani intelligence officers
characterize the discussions as "academic" in nature. It seems that the
discussion was wide-ranging and rudimentary and that the scientists
provided no material or specific plans. Moreover, the
[scientists]{.underline} probably [were incapable of providing truly
helpful information because their expertise was not in bomb
design]{.underline} but in the processing of fissile material, [which
is]{.underline} almost [certainly beyond the capacities of a nonstate
group]{.underline}. Kalid Sheikh Mohammed, the apparent planner of the
9/11 attacks, reportedly says that [[al Qaeda's bomb efforts never went
beyond]{.mark} searching [the Internet]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the
fall of the Taliban in 2001, technical experts from the CIA and the
Department of Energy examined documents and other information that were
uncovered by intelligence agencies and the media in Afghanistan. They
uncovered no credible information that al Qaeda had obtained fissile
material or acquired a nuclear weapon. Moreover, they found no evidence
of any radioactive material suitable for weapons. They did uncover,
however, a "nuclear-related" document discussing "openly available
concepts about the nuclear fuel cycle and some weapons-related issues."
Just a day or two before al Qaeda was to flee from Afghanistan in 2001,
bin Laden supposedly told a Pakistani journalist, "If the United States
uses chemical or nuclear weapons against us, we might respond with
chemical and nuclear weapons. We possess these weapons as a deterrent."
Given the military pressure that they were then under and taking into
account the evidence of the primitive or more probably nonexistent
nature of al Qaeda's nuclear program, [the reported
assertions]{.underline}, although unsettling, [appear at best to be a
desperate bluff]{.underline}. Bin Laden has made statements about
nuclear weapons a few other times. Some of these pronouncements can be
seen to be threatening, but they are rather coy and indirect, indicating
perhaps something of an interest, but not acknowledging a capability.
And as terrorism specialist Louise Richardson observes, "[Statements
claiming a right to possess nuclear weapons have been
misinterpreted]{.underline} as expressing a determination to use them.
[This]{.underline} in turn [has fed the exaggeration of the threat we
face]{.underline}." Norwegian researcher Anne Stenersen concluded after
an exhaustive study of available materials that, although "it is likely
that al Qaeda central has considered the option of using
non-conventional weapons," [there is "little evidence that]{.underline}
such [ideas ever developed into actual plans]{.underline}, or that they
were given any kind of priority at the expense of more traditional types
of terrorist attacks." She also notes that information on an al Qaeda
computer left behind in Afghanistan in 2001 indicates that only \$2,000
to [\$4,000 was earmarked for weapons of mass destruction
research]{.underline} and that [the money was]{.underline} mainly
[for]{.underline} very crude work on [chemical weapons]{.underline}.
Today, the key portions of al Qaeda central may well total only a few
hundred people, apparently assisting the Taliban's distinctly separate,
far larger, and very troublesome insurgency in Afghanistan. Beyond this
tiny band, there are thousands of sympathizers and would-be jihadists
spread around the globe. They mainly connect in Internet chat rooms,
engage in radicalizing conversations, and variously dare each other to
actually do something. [Any "threat]{.underline}," particularly to the
West, [appears]{.underline}, then, [principally to derive from
self-selected people]{.underline}, often isolated from each other, [who
fantasize about performing dire deeds]{.underline}. From time to time
some of these people, or ones closer to al Qaeda central, actually
manage to do some harm. And occasionally, they may even be able to pull
off something large, such as 9/11. But in most cases, [their capacities
and schemes]{.underline}, or alleged schemes, [seem to be far less
dangerous than initial press reports vividly, even hysterically,
suggest]{.underline}. Most important for present purposes, however, is
that [any notion that al Qaeda has the capacity to acquire nuclear
weapons, even if it wanted to, looks farfetched in the
extreme]{.underline}. It is also noteworthy that, although there have
been plenty of terrorist attacks in the world since 2001, all have
relied on conventional destructive methods. For the most part,
terrorists seem to be heeding the advice found in a memo on an al Qaeda
laptop seized in Pakistan in 2004: "Make use of that which is available
... rather than waste valuable time becoming despondent over that which
is not within your reach." In fact, [history consistently demonstrates
that [terrorists prefer weapons]{.mark} that [they know]{.mark} and
understand, not new, exotic ones]{.underline}. Glenn Carle, a 23-year
CIA veteran and once its deputy intelligence officer for transnational
threats, warns, "[We must not take fright at the specter our leaders
have exaggerated]{.underline}. In fact, [we must see jihadists for the
small, lethal, disjointed, and miserable opponents that they
are]{.underline}." al Qaeda, he says, has only a handful of individuals
capable of planning, organizing, and leading a terrorist organization,
and although the group has threatened attacks with nuclear weapons,
"[its capabilities are far inferior to its desires]{.underline}." Policy
alternatives The purpose here has not been to argue that policies
designed to inconvenience the atomic terrorist are necessarily unneeded
or unwise. Rather, in contrast with the many who insist that [atomic
terrorism]{.underline} under current conditions is rather likely---
indeed, exceedingly likely---to come about, I have contended that it [is
hugely unlikely]{.underline}. However, it is important to consider not
only the likelihood that an event will take place, but also its
consequences. Therefore, one must be concerned about catastrophic events
even if their probability is small, and efforts to reduce that
likelihood even further may well be justified. [At some
point]{.underline}, however, [probabilities become so low
that]{.underline}, even for catastrophic events, [it may make sense to
ignore them]{.underline} or at least put them on the back burner; in
short, [the risk becomes acceptable]{.underline}. For example, the
British could at any time attack the United States with their
submarine-launched missiles and kill millions of Americans, far more
than even the most monumentally gifted and lucky terrorist group. Yet
the risk that this potential calamity might take place evokes little
concern; essentially it is an acceptable risk. Meanwhile, Russia, with
whom the United States has a rather strained relationship, could at any
time do vastly more damage with its nuclear weapons, a fully imaginable
calamity that is substantially ignored. In constructing what he calls "a
case for fear," Cass Sunstein, a scholar and current Obama
administration official, has pointed out that if there is a yearly
probability of 1 in 100,000 that terrorists could launch a nuclear or
massive biological attack, the risk would cumulate to 1 in 10,000 over
10 years and to 1 in 5,000 over 20. These odds, he suggests, are "not
the most comforting." Comfort, of course, lies in the viscera of those
to be comforted, and, as he suggests, many would probably have
difficulty settling down with odds like that. But [[there must be some
point at which]{.mark} the [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} even of these
people [would [ease]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just perhaps [[it is
at]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the levels suggested above: one in a
million or [[one in three billion]{.underline}]{.mark} per attempt.

NONE OF this is meant to suggest that the United States faces no major
challenges today. Rather, [the point is that the problems confronting
the country are manageable and pose minimal risks to the lives of the
overwhelming majority of Americans. None of them]{.underline} \--
separately or in combination \-- justifies the alarmist rhetoric of
policymakers and politicians or [should lead to the conclusion that
Americans live in a dangerous world.]{.underline}

[Take terrorism. [Since 9/11, no security threat has been hyped
more]{.mark}]{.underline}. Considering the horrors of that day, that is
not surprising. [But [the result has been a level of fear]{.mark} that
is [completely out of proportion to]{.mark} both the
[capabilities]{.mark} of terrorist organizations [and]{.mark} the United
States\' [vulnerability]{.mark}. [On 9/11, al Qaeda got tragically
lucky. Since then]{.mark}, the United States has been preparing for the
one percent chance (and likely even less) that it might get lucky
again]{.underline}. But [[al Qaeda lost its safe
haven]{.underline}]{.mark} after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in
2001, [[and further]{.mark} military, diplomatic, intelligence, and law
enforcement [efforts have decimated the organization]{.mark}, which has
essentially lost whatever ability it once had to seriously threaten the
United States]{.underline}.

According to U.S. officials, [[al Qaeda\'s leadership has been reduced
to two top lieutenants]{.mark}:]{.underline} Ayman al-Zawahiri and his
second-in-command, Abu Yahya al-Libi. [[Panetta has even said
that]{.mark} the [defeat]{.mark} of al Qaeda [is \"within
reach.\"]{.mark} The near collapse of the original al Qaeda organization
is one reason why, in the decade [since 9/11, the U.S. homeland has not
suffered any large-scale terrorist assaults]{.mark}. All subsequent
attempts have failed or been thwarted, owing in part to the incompetence
of their perpetrators]{.underline}. Although there are undoubtedly still
some [[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} who wish to kill Americans, their
dreams [[will]{.mark} likely [continue to be frustrated by]{.mark} their
own limitations and by the [intelligence and law enforcement]{.mark}
agencies of the United States and its allies.]{.underline}

In the past decade, Cheney and other [one-percenters have frequently
warned of the danger posed by loose nukes or uncontrolled fissile
material]{.underline}. [In fact, [the threat of a nuclear device ending
up in the hands of a terrorist group has diminished
markedly]{.mark}]{.underline} since the early 1990s, when the Soviet
Union\'s nuclear arsenal was dispersed across all of Russia\'s 11 time
zones, all 15 former Soviet republics, and much of eastern Europe. Since
then, [[cooperative]{.mark} U.S.-Russian [efforts have resulted]{.mark}
in the substantial [consolidation of]{.mark} those [weapons]{.mark} at
far fewer sites [and]{.mark} in [comprehensive security upgrades]{.mark}
at almost all the facilities that still possess nuclear material or
warheads, making the possibility of theft or diversion
unlikely]{.underline}. Moreover, [the [lessons]{.mark} learned from
securing Russia\'s nuclear arsenal [are now being applied in other
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, under the framework of Obama\'s April
2010 Nuclear Security Summit, which produced a global plan to secure all
nuclear materials within four years. Since then,
[participants]{.underline} in the plan, including Chile, Mexico,
Ukraine, and Vietnam, [have fulfilled more than 70 percent of the
commitments they made at the summit.]{.underline}

Pakistan represents another potential source of loose
nukes[.]{.underline} The United States\' military strategy in
Afghanistan, with its reliance on drone strikes and cross-border raids,
has actually contributed to instability in Pakistan, worsened U.S.
relations with Islamabad, and potentially increased the possibility of a
weapon falling into the wrong hands. Indeed, Pakistani fears of a U.S.
raid on its nuclear arsenal have reportedly led Islamabad to disperse
its weapons to multiple sites, transporting them in unsecured civilian
vehicles. But [[even in Pakistan, the chances]{.mark} of a terrorist
organization procuring a nuclear weapon [are infinitesimally
small]{.mark}. The U.S. [D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [Energy has
provided assistance to improve]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of
Pakistan\'s nuclear arsenal, [and]{.mark} successive senior U.S.
government [officials have repeated]{.mark} what former Secretary of

Saudi [Arabia and other Gulf states have]{.underline} recently [ordered
U.S. weapons worth]{.underline} around \$123 billion. The largest deal,
if approved by Congress, would be a \$60 billion package of U.S. arms
for Saudi Arabia, including eighty-four new and seventy refurbished F-15
fighters, supplied largely by Boeing, as well as seventy Apache
helicopters, seventy-two Black Hawks, and thirty-six Little Birds.

[Even ideologically]{.underline}, or religiously, [highly charged
leaderships]{.underline} [may be aware of the dangers inherent in
nuclear war and behave rationally]{.underline}. However, [such awareness
and rational decision-making]{.underline} processes [are]{.underline} a

[Nuclear confrontation may not be the result of some irrational but
premeditated decision]{.underline} by leaders [to initiate a nuclear

in escalatory situations]{.underline}. In such situations, it appears
that the [command and control structures that may develop in new nuclear

[The United States shares critical strategic interests with Saudi Arabia

talk of energy independence over the last four decades, the U.S.
Department of Energy estimates that [the United States will be as
strategically dependent on imported oil **through 2035** as it is today.
These projections do not even take account of our indirect imports of
oil in the form of manufactured goods, or our dependence on the health
of a global economy that requires stable supply- and market-driven
prices. The stability of Gulf energy exports is **critical to our
economy and every job in the United States**]{.underline}

#### Economic decline causes global nuclear war 

**Tønnesson 15** -- Stein Tønnesson, Research Professor, Peace Research
Institute Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace Program, Uppsala University,
2015, "Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International
Area Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and **negative trade expectations**]{.underline}
may [generate tensions leading to trade wars among inter-dependent
states that]{.underline} in turn [increase the risk of military
conflict]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The
risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is governed by
an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the
risk of war between China and the US should not just be analysed
bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party countries
could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context it
is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast Asia
(China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated economically
through production networks within a global system of trade and finance
(Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, [decisions for
war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people, who act on the
basis of their future expectations]{.underline}. International relations
theory must be supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to
assess the value attributed by national decision-makers to economic
development and their assessments of risks and opportunities. [If
leaders]{.underline} on either side of the Atlantic [begin to seriously
**fear or anticipate their own nation's decline**]{.underline} then
[they may blame]{.underline} this on [external dependence, appeal to
anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to
gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt protectionist policies,
and]{.underline} ultimately **[refuse to be deterred by]{.underline}**
either [**nuclear arms** or prospects of socioeconomic calamities. Such
a dangerous shift could happen **abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the
instigation of actions by a third party -- or against a third party.

Yet as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the
tensions [in East Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As
Chan (2013) says, all states in the region are aware that they cannot
count on support from either China or the US if they make provocative
moves. [The greatest risk is **not**]{.underline} that **[a territorial
dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present circumstances [but
that **changes in the world economy** alter those circumstances in ways
that render inter-state peace more precarious]{.underline}. If China and
the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations (Roach,
2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
**protect the world from Armageddon**, and **unreliably
so**]{.underline}. [Deterrence could **lose its
credibility**]{.underline}: one of the two [great powers might gamble
that the other yield in a cyber-war or conventional]{.underline} limited
[war]{.underline}, or third party countries might engage in conflict
with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing to
intervene.

### 1NC --- Terror & Chemical Weapons

#### Arm sales to Saudi Arabia are key to deter Iran chemical attack, nuclear attack and terrorism

Deberah **Jerome**, Sept 24, 20**10**, (Deborah Jerome supervises daily
editorial management of CFR.org, and specializes in coverage of the
Middle East and North Africa.  \"Is Big Saudi Arms Sale a Good Idea?,\"

Second, **[U.S. military power is finite, and both the United States and
Saudi Arabia face rapidly changing threats]{.underline}**. [The United
States needs allies that have interoperable forces that can both fight
effectively alongside the United States and ease the U.S. burden by
defending themselves.]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}** already
**[poses a massive asymmetric naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf
states.]{.underline}** The U.S. invasion of Iraq has left Iraqi forces a
decade away from being a counterbalance to Iran; **[Saudi Arabia is the
only meaningful regional power to work with]{.underline}**.
[Additionally, al-Qaeda in the peninsula is based in Yemen, **and the
threat of terrorism and outside infiltration means highly mobile Saudi
forces are critical to the security of Saudi energy and civil
facilities.** Helping Saudi Arabia create a combination of effective air
and naval power also helps ensure the security of tanker and other
shipping in the Gulf of Oman and a steadily more unstable Red
Sea.]{.underline}

Third**[, Iran]{.underline}** already **[poses a missile and chemical
weapons threat and may pose a nuclear one]{.underline}** within the next
three to five years. Upgrades of the Saudi Patriots create a base for an
integrated approach to air and missile defense. They lay the groundwork
for follow-on sales of advanced missile defense systems like THAAD, and
an emphasis on defense (not Saudi purchases of missiles or nuclear
systems). Coupled with recent U.S. offers of \"extended regional
deterrence\" and the creation of a Saudi Air Force that is more of a
threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to Saudi Arabia,
**[they offer the best hope of both giving Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states security and stopping a nuclear arms race in the
region.]{.underline}**

#### [Terrorism]{.underline} causes [extinction]{.underline}

Nickolas **Roth 17** & Matthew Bunn, research associate at the Belfer
Center's Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University, professor

single terrorist nuclear bomb",
<https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/the-effects-of-a-single-terrorist-nuclear-bomb/>

And [what standards of **international order** and law would still
hold]{.underline} sway? [The country attacked might well **lash out
militarily**]{.underline} at whatever countries it thought might bear a
portion of responsibility. (A terrifying description of the kinds of
discussions that might occur appeared in Brian Jenkins' book, Will
Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [With the nuclear threshold already
crossed]{.underline} in this scenario---at least by terrorists---it [is
conceivable that some of the resulting conflicts might **escalate to
nuclear use.**]{.underline} [International politics could
become]{.underline} more **[brutish]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[violent,]{.underline}** [with powerful states taking unilateral
action]{.underline}, [by force]{.underline} if necessary, in an effort
to ensure their security. [After 9/11, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [led the invasions of
two sovereign nations]{.underline}, in wars that have since cost
hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, while plunging
a region into chaos. [Would the reaction after a far more devastating
nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline}

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline} that [others surrender
their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline} (or other
imposed security measures) to guard it.

[That could well be the first step toward a more **profound
transformation of the international system**]{.underline}. After such a
catastrophe, [major powers may feel compelled to more freely engage in
**preventive war**]{.underline}, seizing territories they worry might
otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other steps they see as
brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For this reason,
[foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has argued]{.underline} that
["conventional rules of sovereignty **would be abandoned
overnight**."]{.underline} [Confidence in]{.underline} both the national
security institutions of the country attacked and [international
institutions such as]{.underline} the [International Atomic Energy
Agency and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, which
had so manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, [might
erode]{.underline}. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is hard to
predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push for
nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

#### Chemical weapon attack leads to extinction

**DUJS**, Dartmouth forum for sharing undergraduate research and
enriching scientific knowledge, **09**\[Dartmouth Undergraduate of
Science, May 22, 2009, "Human Extinction: The Uncertainty of Our
Fate", <http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate#.UcyTn8pFUoy>,
7/13/13, AR)

**[Man will destroy himself]{.underline}**. Another possibility is the
death of mankind at the hands of its own weapons. **[One threat lies in
the use of]{.underline}** weapons of mass destruction, internationally
referred to as CBRN (**[Chemical]{.underline}**, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear) **[warfare]{.underline}**. **[Chemical
warfare revolves around the use of toxic, non-living
agents]{.underline}** (mustard, cyanides), while biological warfare
involves the use of living organisms and/or toxins that they produce
(anthrax, botulinum toxin) (20). Though both **[could potentially bring
about human extinction]{.underline}**, radiological and nuclear warfare
have been referred to most often when considering a potential "Doomsday
Machine/Device." Two prominent candidates for the Doomsday Machine have
emerged over the last 60 years. First was the "dead hand," a rumored
underground Soviet monitoring system whose central computer Perimetr
would have facilitated the automated detonation of an extensive nuclear
weapons network, had the Soviet Union come under attack during the Cold
War (21). Though constructed in the 1970s, dead hand is still armed and
operational, according to a 2007 article in the New York Times, and has
been declared a possible Doomsday Machine (22). The other contender is
the theoretical cobalt bomb. Essentially, the cobalt bomb is an atomic
bomb covered in cobalt-59. When bombarded with neutrons, the outer shell
of cobalt-59 is converted into the highly radioactive isotope cobalt-60.
Cobalt-60, as opposed to other radioactive isotopes, has a relatively
long half-life of 5.3 years that would cause the deleterious effects of
a cobalt bomb's radiation to be both long-lasting and global if properly
dispersed -- a surefire recipe for global extinction (23).
Thus, **[while the subject of a man-made human apocalypse seems like the
stuff of science fiction, it may not be so farfetched. However, for
obvious reasons, it is also fair to say that these potential
planet-enders have yet to be successfully tested or
implemented.]{.underline}**

Possessing nuclear weapons allows states to deter adversaries with the
threat of significant reprisal (Brodie 1974). But nuclear proliferation
is a costly strategy. Nuclear weapons are technically difficult to
produce, require the establishment of expensive programs, can cause
significant political rifts with allies, and may motivate rivals to
proliferate (Schwartz 1998; Oberdorfer 2001).

## CP Ideas

#### US supporting the middle east allies in 6 ways solves declining US credibility in the Middle East Woods 14 

(Bobby, "THE DANGERS OF LOST U.S. CREDIBILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST", The
Diplomat, Boulevard Extérieur, February 18 2014,
<https://www.boulevard-exterieur.com/The-Dangers-of-Lost-U-S-Credibility-in-the-Middle-East.html>,
accessed 6/19/19, GDS -- EW)

To prevent a further deterioration of American influence in the region,
effectively deter a near-nuclear Iran, and assure [Arab partners of
American commitment, the United States should undertake six
efforts.]{.underline}

[First, it is time to develop a more coherent, holistic and realistic
strategy for the Middle East that ensures stability and enhances the
balance of power between friendly Arab nations]{.underline} and a still
unfriendly and aggressive Iran. [Working collaboratively with Arab
partners will help to improve American credibility.]{.underline}

Second, Congress and [the president should maintain sanctions against
Iran while also establishing clear milestones that must be met before
sanctions are eased]{.underline}. This would also require giving Arab
partners' concerns consideration regarding any potential removal or
easing of international sanctions.

Third, [undertake a more affective effort to understand the concerns of
Arab partners. There is a real possibility of alienating friendly
governments.]{.underline} Many partner nations have supported U.S.
policy objectives in the Middle East for decades and deserve to have
their concerns heard.

Fourth, [develop and enhance regional security arrangements that include
strategic exercises and joint cooperation between Arab partner nations,
intelligence activities, and strategic demonstration
exercises]{.underline} that are necessary to not only deter a
near-nuclear Iran, but to ensure partner Arab nations.

Fifth, if counter-proliferation in the Middle East is truly an American
imperative[, the U.S. should immediately engage the Saudis and other
friendly Arab nations for the purpose of determining their strategic red
lines]{.underline}. Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons in the
Middle East is possible, but will require deft diplomacy and security
agreements.

Sixth, the U.S. should understand that the Saudis are likely already
looking to other nations to help them ensure their own security in the
event Iran declares itself a nuclear armed state. [The U.S. has an
option to either extend the nuclear umbrella to these partners or allow
them to develop, borrow or purchase their own nuclear
capabilities.]{.underline} It is extremely unlikely that they will
simply do nothing to address their own very real concerns.

[And some skepticism is aimed at Pompeo. In laying out a litany of
Iran's behavior in recent weeks, Pompeo said Tehran was behind a May 31
car bomb in Kabul as a U.S. convoy was passing, lightly injuring four
U.S. service members and killing four Afghans]{.underline}. The Taliban
claimed responsibility for that. But Pompeo said the Taliban claim
should not be believed.

First, [arms sales are signals that cut through the noise of the
international system. Cutting off arms transfers is a common way that
states express their dissatisfaction with others and try to influence
behavior]{.underline}. As Lawrence Freedman observed in 1978, "[refusing
to sell arms is a major political act. It appears as a calculated
insult, reflecting on the stability, trust, and credit-worthiness, or
technical competence of the would-be recipient]{.underline}." Yet this
crucial point seems to have been lost in the current policy debate about
whether or not the United States should continue selling arms to Saudi
Arabia. My research shows [that stopping arms transfers or denying
requests is an effective way to signal dissatisfaction and causes the
would-be recipient to re-think their behavior.]{.underline}

#### US increasing indirect actions for counterterrorism in the middle east and working tight with allies increases credibility Graca, **Project Assistant in the Europe and Central Asia Division at DCA, 19** 

(Patricia, "Analysis of the U.S. Grand Strategy", international Policy
Digest, December 31 2018,

6/20/19, GDS -- EW)

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is the top destination for US arms, with US
defense sales to the kingdom totaling close to \$90 billion for the past
seventy years. In addition, both countries share security concerns about
Iran. They both have ramped up efforts to counter Iran, Saudi Arabia's
main regional rival. Regarding energy supply, the US imports only 25% of
Saudi oil reserves, whereas US allies -- Europe and Japan -- depend on
the Middle Eastern oil, and therefore, should share the responsibility
for stabilizing the region.

[By sharing with its allies the world's security problems, the US
strengthens the allies' presence, shares information, and develops deep
cooperation. Thus, the US and its allies need to work together and
better balance the burden of democratic world order]{.underline}.
Alliances are better for everyone and institutions facilitate iterated
interactions amongst members. The US and European countries cofounded
most of the world's institutions in the aftermath of WWII. Such
institutions helped shape the world we live in. [Therefore, the US
should maintain its robust presence in these institutions as well as in
multilateral agreements.]{.underline}

As for [counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, the US and its allies
should increase their interaction regarding strategic intelligence based
on allied security forces]{.underline}. Terrorism is the world's problem
that needs a collective effort to fight against it. Short-term military
actions informed by long-term analysis, would reshape the international
environment and constrain terrorist attacks.

[The Trump administration should develop a range of politically
credible, clearly articulated indirect actions to support the allies'
efforts to improve their civil defense capabilities]{.underline}. By
adopting a multipolar strategy, the [US would allow other nations to
build their military capabilities and provide for their own national and
regional security]{.underline}. In this great geopolitical rebalancing,
states share the burden of maintaining stability in various parts of the
world, looking for absolute gains and [more peaceful
relations.]{.underline}

#### CP? US taking a stronger stance on their relationship in 4 ways solves relations Singh, **Lane-Swig Senior Fellow and managing director at The Washington Institute and a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council, 18**

(Michael, "THE UNITED STATES, SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE
POST-KHASHOGGI ERA", War on the Rocks, December 18 2018,

6/20/19, GDS-EW)

First, [the United States needs to clean up its diplomatic act with
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia. The Saudis have often, over multiple
administrations, enjoyed privileged access to the Oval Office and
cabinet principals. But going forward[, these actors should clear the
way for the U.S. ambassador and U.S. regional officials by limiting
their direct contacts with Riyadh to prevent diplomatic
"jurisdiction-shopping]{.underline}" and to ensure a coordinated
American approach. In the spirit of making the relationship less
top-heavy, Gen. (ret.) John Abizaid, Washington's ambassador-designate
to the kingdom, should be confirmed quickly and be empowered to provide
veteran guidance to Saudi leadership.

Second, and relatedly, [Washington should insist that Riyadh designate
and empower officials below the king and crown prince with whom American
officials can deal]{.underline}. The United States cannot choose who
leads Saudi Arabia and should not try. [But having so few points of
contact is bound to weaken the bilateral relationship, as no single
figure can be expected to pay adequate attention to the full range of
issues]{.underline} the United States and Saudi Arabia need to confront
together. Vitally, the United States should emphasize that this is in
the best interests of both countries.

[Third, the United States should make clear that arms sales and other
forms of American support are contingent not merely on a shared
conception of threats, but on a common strategy to address those
threats]{.underline}. Differences between the two sides will persist.
[But U.S. support should be an outgrowth of shared goals and strategies,
rather than something that is treated as a test of Washington's loyalty
to the partnership or toughness toward Iran and other
adversaries]{.underline}. Likewise, Washington should take greater pains
to consult Riyadh and other regional allies in advance of major
initiatives that affect the region's security landscape, like the
nuclear agreement with Iran or changes to U.S. policy in Syria.

[Finally, the United States should supplement its bilateral diplomacy
with Riyadh with reinvigorated regional diplomac]{.underline}y. Other
regional allies have an even greater stake in Saudi Arabia's stability
and regional policies than America does. [Multilateral forums can
amplify the voices of seasoned regional leaders whose influence and
experience can be useful to Washington]{.underline} even if their
military and economic assets are comparatively minor. One model for this
is the George W. Bush-era Gulf Security Dialogue, which sought to
coordinate the policies of the United States and its allies across areas
ranging from Iraq to theater missile defense.

[A democratic values-based foreign policy strategy is rooted in faith in
democratic self-government, not just as being better than all the
alternatives]{.underline} but also as a value in and of itself. Such a
foreign policy will also advance U.S. national interests. America's
presence as a prosperous, multi-ethnic, free democratic society poses a
challenge to autocrats through the model it sets. Instead of taking this
power for granted, it is time for America to cultivate it.

At the heart of such an effort should be a realignment of American
foreign policy to meet the challenge posed by resurgent illiberalism.
[This can be done by forging stronger cooperation among democratic
states, including in the defense of democracies under assault and the
expansion of the global democratic space.]{.underline} In both the
short- and long-term, the United States will need to take the following
steps:

[Restore democratic values and norms at home.]{.underline}

[Work with democratic allies to design and implement a
counter-authoritarian playbook to push back against the encroachment on
and abuse of the open systems of democratic states.]{.underline}

[Build stronger international networks of democracies to create a global
democratic bulwark.]{.underline}

[Privilege U.S. relationships with democracies, and reflect this in U.S.
policy decisions and spending]{.underline}

.

[Strengthen international support mechanisms]{.underline} for
populations nonviolently mobilizing for democracy around the world,
[while more systematically pressuring countries to uphold human rights
and adhere to international law.]{.underline}

[Reorienting U.S. foreign policy toward a values-based approach will
require policymakers to take the long view, recognize the intrinsic
strength of democratic governance, and acknowledge that the best way to
advance democracy worldwide is through the example set by successful
democracies]{.underline}. Critically, it will also require U.S. leaders
to heed the lessons of history by recognizing that the most effective
way to promote and sustain democracy is supporting and encouraging
democratic institutions and movements, rather than employing coercive
measures. [The United States has numerous tools to vigorously defend its
values and advance democracy without seeking to impose it using
force.]{.underline}

Some may fear that a values-based foreign policy would come at the
expense of traditional U.S. interests. But that critique misdiagnoses
and underestimates the geopolitical challenge to U.S. interests that a
rising illiberal tide presents. [American interests will be far more
difficult to secure if liberal democracy is supplanted as the
pre-eminent and most sought-after political system]{.underline}. [There
will inevitably be times when U.S. interests will necessitate partnering
with nondemocratic regimes. Still, a principled but pragmatic approach
can do both: cooperate selectively with such regimes on matters of vital
national interest while also recognizing that the greatest strategic
gains to U.S. security]{.underline} and prosperity will rest on the
success of other [America's staying power and strategic resilience will
depend on investing in them.]{.underline}
