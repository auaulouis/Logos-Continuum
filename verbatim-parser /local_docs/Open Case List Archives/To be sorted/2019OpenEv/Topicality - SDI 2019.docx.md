**[Definition of the Term \"Arms\"]{.underline}**

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}nother [[matter that]{.mark} the data leave
unclear]{.underline}, [and that [has posed obstacles]{.mark} to past
arms embargoes and transfer limitations]{.underline}, [[is]{.mark} the
[determination of what should]{.mark} be [count]{.mark}ed [as a
weapon]{.mark}. A tank is clearly one, but what about the rounds of
ammunition that it fires? Or the trucks carrying extra ammunition? Or
the communications gear for the tank\'s crew? Or infantry rifles? On
these points, SIPRI and ACDA differ considerably]{.underline}.

[[SIPRI uses **the narrowest definition**, counting only hardware that
falls into **one of five major categories of weapon systems**: aircraft,
armor and artillery, guidance and radar systems, missiles, and warships.
The classification]{.mark} is helpful]{.underline} where restraint
options are concerned [because it [includes]{.mark} the [items that can
be **counted and verified with greatest
certainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[ACDA defines arms transfers as \"weapons of war, parts thereof,
ammunition, support equipment, and other commodities designed for
military use.\" ACDA]{.mark} thus [includes **a wide range of goods and
services**: military construction, royalties from tech]{.mark}nology
[licenses]{.mark} when they are part of the transfer agreement, [and **a
host of smaller or ancillary equipment**]{.mark} such as nonarmored
military vehicles, communications and electronic equipment, small arms,
ammunition, parachutes, and uniforms]{.underline}.

The ACDA data treat U.S. exports differently than those of the rest of
the world. ACDA excludes construction and other services from the U.S.
export level. It also leaves out dual-use equipment for U.S. exports
unless it is included on the Munitions List, but counts such items for
the rest of the world. (The value of the dual-use equipment is difficult
to gauge, but the foreign military construction sales and \"other
services\" reported by the Department of Defense averaged over \$3
billion a year in the late 1980s---more than 10 percent of the figure
ACD,A reports for total U.S. exports.)

[[Which definition]{.mark} of arms [is most appropriate? **The answer
depends on the issue**]{.mark} at hand. [The limits in this study use
**a narrow definition**]{.mark} **of weapons** [but **are also intended
to comprise dual-use and component trade** that can contribute to the
manufacturing of such major weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. The economic
analyses, however, are based on CBO estimates of what might happen to
all military production.

For all supplier countries except the United States, statistics
published by ACDA will include a dual-use item \"when its primary
mission is identified as military.\" That determination is of course
complicated, and it would pose perhaps the greatest challenge of all in
designing and monitoring supplier limits on the arms trade.

**USSD 18** US State Department, April 16, 2018, \"U.S. Arms Sales and
Defense Trade,\" U.S. Department of State,
<https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm>

DIRECT COMMERCIAL SALES ([[DCS]{.underline}]{.mark}): Under DCS, PM's
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls provides regulatory approvals for
more than \$110 billion per year in sales of defense equipment,
services, and related manufacturing technologies controlled under the 21
categories of the U.S. Munitions List (USML). These [sales [are
negotiated]{.mark} privately [between foreign]{.mark} end‐ [users and
U.S. companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under U.S. law[, [any]{.mark} U.S.
[company or individual involved]{.mark} in certain activities
[involving]{.mark} the [items]{.mark} enumerated [on the USML is
required to receive an]{.mark} approved [export license]{.mark} or other
approval [before providing any]{.mark} USML regulated [item]{.mark},
technical [data, or service]{.mark} to a foreign end‐user]{.underline}.
As with FMS, export licenses approved under DCS are approved following
an intensive U.S. government review and, as required, after
Congressional notification. Export licenses are valid up to four years.
Authorizations for defense services are also required and may last for
longer timeframes. Licenses and authorizations may be extended or
amended as needed. DCS cases are considered to be proprietary agreements
between the foreign governments or companies and the U.S. defense
contractor. However, certain information about cases notified to
Congress is published quarterly in the Federal Register, in fulfillment
of requirements in the Arms Export Control Act.

The United States Government benefits directly and indirectly from
transfers of military technologies or systems to foreign governments or
end users. [Defense technology transfers equip our international friends
and allies with capabilities needed to address regional and global
security concerns. Foreign sales bolster the U.S. industrial base by
maintaining productivity, lowering overall defense systems' costs and
providing capital for innovation. The Department of [State's]{.mark}
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ([DDTC]{.mark}) [issues and
administers licenses permitting U.S. vendors to sell defense items to
foreign]{.mark} end [users]{.mark}. The Department of Commerce's Bureau
of Industry and Security ([BIS) issues export]{.mark} [licenses]{.mark}
for sales of dual‐use and certain defense items. The Department of
[Defense's role]{.mark} in the export approval process [is to
review]{.mark} proposed [transfers]{.mark} for national security
concerns and recommend one of the following: Approval, Approval with
additional measures that manage the risk of diversion or misuse by
foreign parties, Return for more information, or Denial. [The
Department's recommendation is]{.mark} forwarded back to the licensing
agency and is [one of many]{.mark} USG [Interagency positions State and
Commerce consider]{.mark} when determining whether to issue the
license.]{.underline} DTSA, as Department of Defense's lead agency for
export license reviews, conducts in‐depth national security reviews of
export license requests for transfers of defense‐related items referred
from both State and Commerce. DTSA also works closely with Industry and
International counterparts before licenses are requested to identify
potential technology security or foreign disclosure issues. The national
security review gathers assessments of operational impacts from offices
throughout the Department (Intra‐Agency), including the Military
Department (MILDEPs) ‐ Army, Air Force, Navy ‐ Joint Staff, Acquisition,
Technology & Logistics and Policy. In addition, DTSA has its own
in‐house technologists (engineers and scientists), foreign affairs
specialists, and information security specialists provide technology
security focused recommendations. DTSA Licensing Specialists assimilate,
and often arbitrate between, diverse and sometimes opposing positions
into the final DoD position with the security provisions necessary and
appropriate to protect the U.S. military technological edge.

U.S. Process For Conventional Weapons Sales

[[The U.S. exports conventional weapons]{.mark} abroad [through **five
legal means**, including]{.mark}]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales
(**[[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), Direct Commercial Sales
(**[[DCS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[**leases of equipment**, **transfers
of excess defense articles**, and **emergency draw-down of
weaponry**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most conventional weapons deals begin
with contact between a foreign government and a U.S. Security Assistance
Organization (SAO). SAOs consist of U.S. military personnel located in
diplomatic posts and \[end page 5\] embassies abroad. They help foreign
militaries define their needs, provide them with data on U.S. military
equipment, and function as the in-country focal point for U.S. weapons
contractors. These offices produce annual military assistance
assessments which form the basis for the military aid and conventional
weapons sales programs. SAO personnel determine which form of transfer
best suits the recipient - sale, joint production of the weapons, lease,
or grant transfer. All of the above functions are controlled by the
Department of Defense (DoD).22 The State Department provides DoD with
oversight by approving U.S. arms for export and administering U.S.
foreign aid, including security assistance to foreign militaries.23

### FMS\-\--FYI

#### FMS is the transfer of defense equipment purchased by foreign allies and partners

Defense Trade,\" U.S. Department of State,
<https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm>

FOREIGN MILITARY SALES ([[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}) Under FMS, the
United States government manages [[the transfer of]{.underline}]{.mark}
approximately \$40 billion per year in [[defense equipment purchased by
foreign allies and partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. PM's Office of
Regional Security and Arms Transfers (PM/RSAT) manages the FMS process,
in close partnership with the Department of Defense's Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which implements FMS cases by working through
the military services to negotiate with U.S. defense contractors.
PM/RSAT further manages the FMS process by providing the customer with
training, sustainment, and contractor logistics support for the lifetime
of the sale. The FMS sales process begins when a country submits a
formal Letter of Request that specifies a desired military capability
and a rough price. Sales are approved following U.S. government review
and, when required, after Congressional notification. After the sale is
approved, the DSCA issues a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) that
specifies the exact defense articles, training, and support to be
delivered. Processing time for FMS cases may vary; they can take months
to negotiate, especially for major defense articles that require
modifications to standard U.S. systems. Due primarily to the time
required for construction of sophisticated defense systems such as
fighter aircraft, countries often do not receive delivery of the full
package until years after the LOA is finalized. Major FMS sales that
have been formally notified to Congress are publicly announced on the
DSCA website: <http://www.dsca.mil/major‐arms‐sales>.

[[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark} (AECA, Sections 21-22, 22 U.S.C. 2761-2762)
[[is the]{.mark} U.S. government's [main vehicle for selling

friendly foreign countries. Military]{.underline} \[end page 43\]
[[weapons and equipment ranges from **major weapons systems**]{.mark},
such as sophisticated aircraft, [to **smaller items**]{.mark}, such as
patrol boats, night vision goggles, and military boots. Foreign
[governments may purchase]{.mark} such [items directly from]{.mark} the
[private companies]{.mark} offering them, [but many prefer]{.mark} to
purchase through [FMS because the U.S.]{.mark} government
[negotiates]{.mark} with those suppliers [for **packages of materiel and
services**]{.mark} on behalf of that government and monitors the
procurement process through delivery. [FMF grants and
loans]{.mark}]{.underline} (AECA, Section 23, 22 U.S.C. 2763) [[are
provided]{.mark} to selected foreign governments to purchase items
**[through FMS]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The State Department is primarily
responsible for determining which nations are to receive military
assistance from each program. The actual FMF expenditure for FY2015 was
\$5.9 billion in the enduring and OCO budgets, of which \$4.4 billion
was provided in the enduring budget to Israel (\$3.1 billion) and Egypt
(\$1.3 billion). (For FY2016, total estimated FMF in the enduring and
OCO budgets was \$6.0 billion, but the State Department has not provided
a by-country breakdown by country.) For FY2017, the State Department
requested some \$5.7 billion in the enduring and OCO budgets, with same
dollar amounts as in FY2015 in the enduring budget for Israel and Egypt.

years of operation, it funded the stockpiling of "various defense
articles ranging from arms and ammunition, to radars and radios and
Night Vision Goggles, to major end items such as helicopters, small
boats, tanks, vehicles, and missiles" for future sales to partner
nations.102 The SDAF was recapitalized in FY2012 (as recommended the
previous year by a Security Cooperation Reform Task Force working on
FMS/FMF reform) from FMF funds authorized for transfer to the account
(P.L. 112-74, Section 7080), as well as from receipts from selected FMS
sales.103 Most stockpiled defense articles are sold to partner nations
or provided to them through U.S. building partner capacity programs. The
SDAF may also be used to purchase defense services.

IV\. Review Of The Literature On FMS And DCS

A. Foreign Military Sales

1\. **[Definition]{.underline}**

Foreign Military Sales ([[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}) [is a component of
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [Security Assistance
Program authorized by the]{.underline} Arms Export Control Act
([AECA]{.underline}). [It [provides]{.mark} for the [transfer of
**defense articles and/or defense services**, **including training**, to
eligible foreign purchasers. It is a **government-to-government
sale**]{.mark} of U.S. defense articles and services, usually
from]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) [stocks or
through new procurement under DoD-managed contracts]{.underline} (DoD
5105.38-M, 2003).

#### FMS includes associated training and equipment. 

**Serafino 16** --- Nina M. Serafino, Specialist in International
Security Affairs at the Congressional Research Service, 2016 ("Security
Assistance and Cooperation: Shared Responsibility of the Departments of
State and Defense," Congressional Research Service Report No. R44444,
May 26^th^, Available Online at
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44444.pdf>, Accessed 06-11-2019, p. 40)

Congress provided additional security assistance authority through other
laws as well. The AECA, a major new Title 22 authority, was added in
1968.95 [The [AECA provided]{.mark} new [authority for cash arms sales
(**with associated training and equipment**) through]{.mark}
a]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales ([[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark})
[program and for assistance in purchasing arms and associated training
and equipment through a]{.underline} Foreign Military Financing
([FMF]{.underline}) [credit and grant authority. AECA authority overlaps
with 1961 FAA security assistance provisions, which the AECA amended to
provide congruent authority]{.underline}. Like the 1961 FAA, the AECA
vests responsibility in the Secretary of State, under the direction of
the President, for providing "continuous supervision and general
direction" oversight, in this case for provisions of the act.
Nonproliferation and similar assistance is another area where Congress
legislated separate but related authorities under Titles 22, 10, and
50.96

**------ Footnotes ------**

95\. The original 1968 legislation was the Foreign Military Sales Act
(FMSA), P.L. 90-629. The FMSA was renamed the Arms Export Control Act
and substantially amended by Title II of the International Security
Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976, P.L. 94-329.

What Is FMS? Foreign Military Sales ([[FMS) is the U.S.
Government]{.mark}'s program for [transferring]{.mark} defense
[articles, services, and training to]{.mark} our [international partners
and]{.mark} international [organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The FMS
program is funded by administrative charges to foreign purchasers and is
operated at no cost to taxpayers. The Defense Security Cooperation
Agency (DSCA) administers the FMS program for the Department of Defense
(DoD). [Under FMS]{.underline}, the U.S. government uses DoD's
acquisition system to procure defense articles and services on behalf of
its partners. Eligible countries may purchase defense articles and
services with their own funds or with funds provided through U.S.
government‐sponsored assistance programs. In certain cases, [defense
[articles may be]{.mark} obtained [through grants or
leases]{.mark}]{.underline}. Who can participate in the FMS program? The
President designates countries and international organizations eligible
to participate in FMS. The Department of State approves individual
programs on a case‐by‐case basis. Currently, some 179 countries and
international organizationsparticipate in FMS.

# REDUCE

### Reduce\-\--Decrease\-\--1NC

#### The Aff must diminish arms sales -- to "reduce" unambiguously excludes an increase

**Friedman 99** (Senior Circuit Judge -- U.S. Fed Circuit Court of
Appeals, 2-9,
caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&case=/data2/circs/Fed/985033.html)

\"\[T\]he amount determined\" under § 809, by which the policyholder
dividend deduction is to be \"reduced,\" is the \"excess\" specified in
§ 809(c)(1). Like the word \"excess,\" [the word [\"reduced\" is
a]{.mark} common, **[unambiguous]{.mark}**, non-technical [term]{.mark}
that is [given its **ordinary meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. See San
Joaquin Fruit & Inv. Co. , [297 U.S. at

. [\"Reduce\" means \"[to diminish in]{.mark}]{.underline} size,
[[amount]{.underline}]{.mark}, extent, or number.\" Webster\'s Third
International Dictionary 1905. Under CUNA\'s interpretation of
\"excess\" in § 809(c), however, the result of the \"amount
determin\[ation\]\" under § 809 would be not to reduce the policyholder
dividends deduction, but to increase it. This would directly contradict
the explicit instruction in § 808(c)(2) that the deduction \"be
reduced.\" **[[The word \"reduce\" cannot be
interpreted]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as CUNA would treat it, **[[to mean
\"increase.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Violation\-\--the plan does not reduce arms sales

#### Voting issue\-\--

#### 1. Ground\-\--every topic DA assumes a net-reduction in support -- like politics, relations, and appeasement -- core ground is key to fairness: otherwise, we're behind from the start

#### 2. Limits\-\--they make the topic bidirectional, allowing both diminishment and augmentation -- this more than doubles the number of Affs that the Neg is required to research, undermining depth of discussion

#### 3. Predictability\-\--our interpretation assumes the common, non-technical meaning of 'reduce' -- they throw consensus out the window

### Reduce\-\--Decrease\-\--Interpretation

#### Reduce is to bring down to a smaller amount

**Random House 6** (Unabridged Dictionary,
<http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reduce>)

1\. [to [bring down to a smaller]{.mark}]{.underline} extent, size,

#### Reduce excludes eliminate

**Words and Phrases, 2** (vol 36B, p. 80)

Mass. 1905. Rev.Laws, c.203, § 9, provides that, if two or more cases

ordinary witness fees, and other costs recoverable in one of the cases"
which are so tried together shall be allowed. Held that, in reducing the
costs, the amount in all the cases together is to be considered and
reduced, providing that there must be left in the aggregate an amount
not less than the largest sum recoverable in any of the cases. [[The
word "reduce,"]{.mark} in its ordinary signification, [does not mean to

lower, or bring to an inferior state]{.underline}.---Green v. Sklar, 74
N.E. 595, 188 Mass. 363.

**Violation\-\--the affirmative withdraws completely**

**Voting issue\-\--**

#### 1. Limits\-\--they create more affs and explode the topic literature base; we have to be accountable for the entire peace movement and answer critical affs which require distinct strategies

#### 2. Predictability\-\--our evidence signifies the ordinary meaning of reduce; moving beyond the ordinary meaning of words sets a precedent to interpret the all other words unpredictably

### Reduce\-\--Not Eliminate\-\--Interpretation

#### "Reduce" does not mean eliminate

**Cullen 8** (Edward, "RE: Opaque Objects", 7-21,
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.sdl/37680>)

Implementing opaque objects to many of the larger structures would NOT
add much, if any overhead, as the majority of the structs and functions
concerned already pass-by-reference; it would be a \'cosmetic\' change
aimed at reducing the cognitive load placed on the developer. (By
cognitive load, I mean the amount \"I need to care about HOW this
works\"). [Note [the word \'reduce\' is does \*not\* mean
\'eliminate\']{.mark}]{.underline}; you can never get away from the fact
that this \*is\* a C API, something that I have always been aware of (in
spite of being accused of the opposite many times).

### Reduce\-\--Permanence\-\--1NC

#### Reduce means permanent reduction -- it's distinct from "suspend"

**Reynolds, 59** -- Judge (In the Matter of Doris A. Montesani,
Petitioner, v. Arthur Levitt, as Comptroller of the State of New York,
et al., Respondents \[NO NUMBER IN ORIGINAL\] Supreme Court of New York,

N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 7391 August 13, 1959)

Section 83\'s counterpart with regard to nondisability pensioners,
section 84, prescribes a reduction only if the pensioner should again
take a public job. The disability pensioner is penalized if he takes any
type of employment. The reason for the difference, of course, is that in
one case the only reason pension benefits are available is because the
pensioner is considered incapable of gainful employment, while in the
other he has fully completed his \"tour\" and is considered as having
earned his reward with almost no strings attached. It would be
manifestly unfair to the ordinary retiree to accord the disability
retiree the benefits of the System to which they both belong when the
latter is otherwise capable of earning a living and had not fulfilled
his service obligation. If it were to be held that withholdings under
section 83 were payable whenever the pensioner died or stopped his other
employment the whole purpose of the provision would be defeated, i.e.,
the System might just as well have continued payments during the other
employment since it must later pay it anyway.  \[\*\*\*13\]  [[The
section says \"reduced\", does **not say**]{.mark} that]{.underline}
monthly [[payments]{.mark} shall [be **temporarily** suspended]{.mark};
it says that the pension itself shall be reduced. [The plain]{.mark}
dictionary [meaning]{.mark} of the word [is to
diminish]{.mark}]{.underline}, lower or degrade. [[The word
\"reduce\"]{.mark} seems]{.underline} adequately [to [indicate
**permanency**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Violation\-\--the Aff only suspends a military operation, it doesn't reduce it

#### Voting issue\-\--

#### 1. Limits\-\--allowing suspension effectively doubles the size of the topic\-\--all currently run affs can be suspended or reduced

#### 2. Negative ground\-\--allowing suspension destroys disad links, it allows them to say that the possibility of resuming arms sales deters or signals that the US is still committed

**Widener, 1** -- Judge for US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
(CARRINGTON GARDENS ASSOCIATES, I, A VIRGINIA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,
Plaintiff-Appellant, v. HENRY G. CISNEROS, SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND
URBAN DEVELOPMENT, Defendant-Appellee, 1 Fed. Appx. 239; 2001 U.S. App.
LEXIS 634, 1/17, lexis)

Under the regulation, 24 C.F.R. § 886.123, the payments to Carrington
could have been stopped for good, the contract terms aside. For
construction of the contract terms, we adopt the wording of the opinion
of the district court for the next three paragraphs of this opinion
which follow:

The plain meaning of the word \"withhold\" is \"to retain in one\'s
possession that which belongs to or is claimed or sought by another. . .
. To refrain from paying that which is due.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary
1602 (6th ed. 1990). Using this common meaning of \"withhold,\" HUD
clearly has the authority to retain housing assistance payments. But,
the HAP Contract\'s withhold remedy also limits how long \[\*\*7\]  the
funds may be retained. The housing assistance payments may be retained
only \"until the default under this Contract has been cured.\" Tr. Ex.
8, § 26. Once the default is cured, HUD may no longer keep the retained
funds. This remedy, therefore, creates a trust type relationship where
HUD has the authority to keep the withheld funds on the owner\'s account
only while the owner is in default and thereafter must pay out the
withheld funds when the default is cured.

In contrast, the reduce-or-suspend remedy suggests a more permanent
forfeiture of funds. [[The word \"suspend\" means
\"]{.underline}]{.mark}to interrupt; to cause [[to cease for a
time;]{.underline}]{.mark} to post pone; to stay, delay, or hinder; to
discontinue temporarily, [[but with an expectation]{.mark} or purpose
[of resumption]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 1446 (6th
ed. 1990). \"[[Reduce\" means \"to diminish]{.mark} in
size]{.underline}, amount, extent, or number.\" Webster\'s Third New
International Dictionary 1905 (1981). \<3\> [Based on these definitions,
[\"reduce\" is merely a less radical form of
\"suspend.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

Under the common meanings of \"reduce\" and \"suspend,\" HUD has the
authority to discontinue housing assistance payments entirely or
diminish the size of the payments while Carrington Gardens \[\*\*8\]  is
in default. Like the withhold remedy, this remedy limits how long
payments may be discontinued or diminished \-- only \"until the default
under this Contract has been cured.\" Tr. Ex. 8, § 26. After the default
has been cured, therefore, HUD must resume full housing assistance
payments. Unlike the withhold remedy, however, under the plain language
of the reduce-or-suspend remedy, HUD is under no obligation to pay out
any discontinued or diminished funds. The words \"suspend\" or
\"reduce\" furnish no inference or suggestion that HUD is obligated to
retain suspended or reduced funds on the owner\'s account until a
default is cured. This language in the HAP Contract speaks  \[\*243\] 
only to HUD\'s obligation to begin full payments after the default is
cured. JA 546-548.

under Defense Department authorities; and \$47.71 billion funded by
partner nations.

[The]{.underline} Fiscal Year [2018 total [is a 33 percent
increase]{.mark} above total sales in]{.underline} Fiscal Year
[2017]{.underline}. DSCA includes sales in the end-of-year total when a
partner nation signs and makes the initial deposit on a Letter of Offer
and Acceptance. Since it may only be a matter of days between a sale
counting in Fiscal Year 2018 and Fiscal Year 2019. DSCA considers the
three-year, rolling average a more accurate way to measure trends in
sales. [With the]{.underline} Fiscal Year [2018 totals included, [the
three-year, rolling average is \$43]{.mark}.7 [billion]{.mark} and
demonstrates a continued upward trend]{.underline}.

The continuing trend coincides with policy reforms the Administration is
spearheading to better align conventional arms transfers with national
security and economic interests. On April 19, 2018, the Administration
updated the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy which lays out a series of
activities the Administration will take to ensure arms transfers support
U.S. allies and foreign partners, expand opportunities for American
industry, and create new American jobs.

As part of this effort, DSCA is working with offices across the
interagency to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the FMS process.
Recently, DSCA reduced the FMS Administrative Surcharge from 3.5 percent
to 3.2 percent lowering the cost of doing business with the United
States Government through FMS. DSCA also reduced the FMS Transportation
Rate, providing partner nations with more cost-effective options to
transfer U.S. defense articles and services using the Defense
Transportation System.

"These policy changes advance U.S. national security and foreign policy
because they make FMS more attractive in a very competitive market,"
said DSCA Director LTG Charles W. Hooper. "The United States not only
sells the world's most state-of-the-art defense systems, but we also
strengthen our alliances and attract new partners through enduring
strategic and defense partnership."

because the purpose of IRC section 382 is to prevent loss trafficking,
so it would seem that the asset test ought to apply to the old loss
corporation.

[The Effect of a Ban or Reduction of Foreign Military Sales]{.underline}

[[The current level]{.mark} of f]{.underline}oreign
[m]{.underline}ilitary [s]{.underline}ales [[is]{.mark} **approximately
[\$8 billion]{.mark} per year**]{.underline}. Tables 8 and 9 contain
estimates of total savings and R&D savings under an \$8 billion sales
program, using the current mix of sales (mix 1) and the previous mix of
sales (mix 2). (As discussed earlier, R&D savings have been broken out
separately since they are relatively insensitive to particular
assumptions about the U.S. production base and the pace of U.S.
procurement.) Under the current mix of sales, total savings would on the
average be \$560 million annually, while R&D savings would be \$160
million per year. Tables 8 and 9 also contain estimates of the savings
under a \$4 billion sales program. It should be noted that the estimates
are averages and in any one year the savings might be different from the
estimates, depending on the mix and timing of rates.

Using Tables 8 and 9 [[it is possible to estimate the]{.mark} budgetary
[impact of **a complete ban** or **a substantial reduction**]{.mark} in
the level of f]{.underline}oreign [m]{.underline}ilitary
[s]{.underline}ales. Under the current mix of sales, [[a complete
ban]{.mark} on f]{.underline}oreign [m]{.underline}ilitary
[s]{.underline}ales [[would]{.mark} on the average [result in the loss
of savings of \$560 million]{.mark} per year, which includes a \$160
million loss in R&D recoupments. [If the level of sales were to be
**reduced to \$4 billion**]{.mark} and the percentage of sales with the
potential to generate savings were to remain at the current level of 50
percent, then [the loss in savings would be \$280 million]{.mark} per
year, including an \$80 million loss in R&D recoupments]{.underline}.
However, [if the mix of sales for a \$4 billion program were assumed to
be similar to the mix under \$4 billion programs in previous
years]{.underline} (70 percent of sales have the potential to generate
savings), [then the loss in savings would be \$168 million per year,
including \$48 million in R&D recoupments]{.underline}.

#### In the military context, a substantial reduction is [50 percent or more]{.underline}.

**Brown 94** (Mark R., Professor of Law -- Stetson University College of
Law, "The Demise of Constitutional Prospectivity: New Life for Owen?",
Iowa Law Review, January, 79 Iowa L. Rev. 273, Lexis)

n241 I am assuming here that \"foreseeable\" means \"probable,\" as in
\"more probable than not.\" This appears to be a safe assumption given
the proliferance of cases granting immunity to officials who offend the
Constitution. If this definition is correct, deterrence only works and
liability should only attach if one\'s conduct, viewed ex ante, is more
likely illegal than legal: the risk of illegality must be more than
fifty percent. In other words, one cannot face deterrence, and liability
will not attach, if the risk of illegality is less than fifty percent[.
(When viewed in this fashion, [one might perceive a
risk]{.mark}]{.underline} of illegality but still not be deterrable
because the risk [[is **not substantial, i.e., not greater than fifty
percent**.)]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lawful conduct, of course, need not be
probably lawful. That is what risk is about. Situations might arise
where the objective risk is that conduct is unlawful, but ex post it is
lawful. Lest judicial reasoning be completely askew, a fairly strong
correlation exists, however, between action that is ex ante probably
lawful and that which is lawful ex post in the courts. If this is not
true, then courts are reaching objectively improbable conclusions, and
the whole idea of reliance is illusory.

7\. INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITION AND EXPORTABILITY

a\. International Acquisition and Exportability Considerations. Program
management is responsible for integrating international acquisition and
exportability considerations into the program's Acquisition Strategy at
each major milestone or decision point. [Program [management will
consider]{.mark} the potential demand and likelihood of cooperative
development or production, **[D]{.mark}**irect **[C]{.mark}**ommercial
**[S]{.mark}**ales, [or]{.mark} **[F]{.mark}**oreign
**[M]{.mark}**ilitary **[S]{.mark}**ales early in the acquisition
planning process; and consider U.S. export control laws, regulations,
and DoD policy for international transfers]{.underline} when formulating
and implementing the acquisition strategy; in accordance with DoD
Instruction 2040.02 (Reference (az)). Where appropriate, program
managers will pursue cooperative opportunities and international
involvement throughout the acquisition life cycle to enhance
international cooperation and improve interoperability in accordance
with DoD Instruction 2010.06 (Reference (ba)).

b\. International Cooperative Program Management

\(1\) An international cooperative program (ICP) is any acquisition
program or technology project that includes participation by the U.S.
and one or more foreign nations, through an international agreement,
during any phase of a system's life cycle. When applicable, program
staff members are encouraged to use streamlined agreement procedures.
All ICPs will consider applicable U.S.-ratified materiel international
standardization agreements in accordance with Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01HI (Reference (d)(e)), and fully
comply with applicable foreign disclosure, export control, technology
transfer, program protection, and security requirements. Programs
containing classified information will have a Delegation of Disclosure
Authority Letter or other written authorization issued by the DoD
Component's cognizant foreign disclosure office prior to entering
discussions with potential foreign partners.

\(2\) DoD Components will notify and obtain the approval of the DAE for
MDAP and MAIS programs before terminating or substantially reducing
participation in ICPs under signed international agreements. The DAE may
require the DoD Component to continue to provide some or all of the
funding for that program. [[A substantial reduction is]{.mark} defined
as [a funding or quantity decrease that impacts the viability of the
program]{.mark} and/or significantly increases the costs to the other
participants in the program.]{.underline}

In reversing a summary judgment of invalidity, [the U.S. Court of
[Appeals]{.mark}]{.underline} for the Federal Circuit [[found]{.mark}
that [the district court]{.mark},]{.underline} by failing to look beyond
the intrinsic claim construction evidence to consider what a person of
skill in the art would understand in a \"technologic context,\"
[**[erroneously concluded]{.mark}** the term [\"substantially\" made a
claim fatally indefinite]{.mark}.]{.underline}  Verve, LLC v. Crane
Cams, Inc., Case No. 01-1417 (Fed. Cir. November 14, 2002). The patent
in suit related to an improved push rod for an internal combustion
engine.  The patent claims a hollow push rod whose overall diameter is
larger at the middle than at the ends and has \"substantially constant
wall thickness\" throughout the rod and rounded seats at the tips.  The
district court found that the expression \"substantially constant wall
thickness\" was not supported in the specification and prosecution
history by a sufficiently clear definition of \"substantially\" and was,
therefore, indefinite.  The district court recognized that the use of
the term \"substantially\" may be definite in some cases but ruled that
in this case it was indefinite because it was not further defined. The
Federal Circuit reversed, concluding that the district court erred in
requiring that the meaning of the term \"substantially\" in a particular
\"technologic context\" be found solely in intrinsic evidence:  \"While
reference to intrinsic evidence is primary in interpreting claims, the
criterion is the meaning of words as they would be understood by persons
in the field of the invention.\"  Thus, [[the Federal Circuit
instructed]{.mark} that \"[resolution of]{.mark} any
[ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline} arising from the claims and
specification [[may be aided by]{.underline}]{.mark} extrinsic
[[evidence]{.mark} of usage]{.underline} and meaning of a term in the
context of the invention.\"  The Federal Circuit remanded the case to
the district court with instruction that [[\"\[t\]he question is
not]{.mark} whether the word \'substantially\' has a [fixed
meaning]{.mark}]{.underline} as applied to \'constant wall thickness,\'
[[but how the phrase would be understood by persons]{.mark}
[experienced]{.mark} in this field]{.underline} of mechanics, upon
reading the patent documents.\"

In *Victor*, the trial court instructed that: \"A reasonable doubt is an
actual and substantial doubt . . . as distinguished from a doubt arising
from mere  \[\*64\]  possibility, from bare imagination, or from
fanciful conjecture.\" Victor argued on appeal after receiving the death
penalty that equating a reasonable doubt with a \"substantial doubt\"
overstated the degree of doubt necessary for acquittal.
[[Although]{.mark} the court agreed that the instruction was problematic
given that [\"substantial,\" could be defined as \"that]{.mark}
specified [to a large degree,\" it also ruled]{.mark} that [any
ambiguity was removed by reading the phrase in]{.mark} the
[context]{.mark} of the sentence in which it appeared]{.underline}.
Finding such an explicit distinction between a substantial doubt and a
fanciful conjecture was not present in the *Cage* instruction, it held
that the context makes clear that \"substantial\" was used in the sense
of existence rather than in magnitude of the doubt and, therefore, it
was not unconstitutional as applied. [*Id. at

<https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm>

FOREIGN MILITARY SALES ([[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}) Under FMS, the
United States government manages [the [transfer]{.mark} of approximately
[\$40 billion per year in defense equipment]{.mark} purchased by foreign
allies and partners.]{.underline} PM's Office of Regional Security and
Arms Transfers (PM/RSAT) manages the FMS process, in close partnership
with the Department of Defense's Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), which implements FMS cases by working through the military
services to negotiate with U.S. defense contractors. PM/RSAT further
manages the FMS process by providing the customer with training,
sustainment, and contractor logistics support for the lifetime of the
sale. The FMS sales process begins when a country submits a formal
Letter of Request that specifies a desired military capability and a
rough price. Sales are approved following U.S. government review and,
when required, after Congressional notification. After the sale is
approved, the DSCA issues a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) that
specifies the exact defense articles, training, and support to be
delivered. Processing time for FMS cases may vary; they can take months
to negotiate, especially for major defense articles that require
modifications to standard U.S. systems. Due primarily to the time
required for construction of sophisticated defense systems such as
fighter aircraft, countries often do not receive delivery of the full
package until years after the LOA is finalized. Major FMS sales that
have been formally notified to Congress are publicly announced on the
DSCA website: <http://www.dsca.mil/major‐arms‐sales>.

#### Substantial means "of considerable amount" -- not some contrived percentage

Circuit, "Committee For Fairly Traded Venezuelan Cement v. United

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
["substantial" generally means "considerable]{.mark} in
amount,]{.underline} value or worth."  Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 2280 (1993).  [**[It does not]{.mark} [imply a specific
number]{.mark} or cut-off**.  [What may be substantial in one situation
may not be in another]{.mark} situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth
of the term "substantial" undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress
spoke clearly in establishing a standard for the Commission's regional
antidumping and countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the
conclusion that the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation
of "substantial proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its
analysis having been given considerable leeway to interpret a
particularly broad term.

[[Might]{.mark} price reductions of less than [twenty percent qualify as
substantial? In some markets]{.mark} they should, and [it would be
**reasonable to decide substantiality**]{.mark} **on a
[case-by-case]{.mark} basis**]{.underline}. One advantage of a
bright-line rule is that it would let incumbents know where they stand.
Monopolies that price only slightly above their average cost would be
insulated from the entry of higher-cost entrants if they could credibly
convey a willingness to price below the entrants\' cost after entry, as
illustrated in Part III. However, these monopolies do consumers little
harm and may enhance market efficiency.

### Substantially\-\--No Baseline

However, the DCS Services problem is one that can't easily be got round:
**[[there is]{.mark} simply [no]{.mark} viable [way to produce even
a]{.mark} meaningful [range of estimates]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Moreover, it is likely that [[most]{.mark} military [services are
excluded from]{.mark}]{.underline} other countries' [deliveries
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}. Military services are however included in US
FMS delivery data, and in the UK figures on arms export orders, and are
likely to be a very substantial proportion, especially to Saudi Arabia.

My final estimate: the total value of the legal global arms trade,
excluding [military services [under US DCS]{.mark}]{.underline} and
other countries that [do not report]{.underline} such
[services]{.underline}, probably lies in the range \$86-105 billion per
year. [The [missing services]{.mark} certainly [run into the]{.mark}

any confidence. **[The [data is]{.mark}, as I say, [really, really,

**[[Webster\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** Dictionary also [[lends support to
the **qualitative** nature of the word]{.underline}]{.mark} by defining
its primary meaning as \"consisting of or relating to substance; not

#### It's a term carelessly thrown around

**Malaguli 11**, (Ransmeier & Spellman Law Firm, SUBSTANTIAL CONFUSION:
The Use and Misuse of the Word \"Substantial\" in the Legal Profession)

INTRODUCTION A search on Westlaw for "substan!" turns up 2,793,047
documents.2 This reflects a fact most lawyers know intuitively but upon
which few probably reflect: [the use of the word "[substantial"
pervades]{.mark} the [legal lexicon]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 [Lawyers,
judges and legislators use the word "substantial" like sailors use the
word --- well, you get the idea. This is problematic]{.underline}
because [there are at least three viable (and very different)
definitions of the word, and]{.underline} because [legal writers rarely
specify which of these definitions they are using. Inevitably, this
**[carelessness infects the law with uncertainty]{.mark} and
doubt.**]{.underline} At its best, the word "substantial" gives the law
flexibility so that it can embrace and resolve the facts of divergent
cases.4 [At its worst, [it is "thrown around" negligently]{.mark} by
courts and advocates [eager to attach]{.mark} the imprimatur of fact and
[authority]{.mark} to their positions.]{.underline} "Substantial" is
among the most widely used words in the law.5 During the 1930s and
coinciding with the emergence of the administrative state, it began to
appear in print with increasing frequency.6 Part of my aim in this
article is simply to underscore the word's prevalence in legal writing.
This goal is animated by my belief that there exists among legal writers
an ignorance regarding how heavily "substantial" is relied upon. There
is the substantial factor test of causation, substantial certainty for
intentional torts, substantial justice for minimum contacts, substantial
performance for contracts, the substantial evidence standard of review
in administrative law, the substantial compliance doctrine for wills
formalities, and the substantial capacity test for criminal law. In
intellectual property, there is the concept of substantial equivalents.
These examples only begin to scratch the surface. [Not only does
"substantial" appear frequently; when it does appear, it tends to carry
operative importance. No article or case]{.underline} of which I am
aware has [devoted more than a paragraph or two to examining directly
this all-important word, leaving a **troublesome gap**]{.underline} in
the scholarly literature.7 This article is intended to highlight this
problem and to begin a discussion that I hope others will join. I argue
that **[the word "[substantial]{.mark}" has [never had a single, stable
definition.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Instead, it signifies a rancorous
philosophical debate that has raged since ancient Greece. However, I
also suggest that [[most current uses]{.mark} of "substantial"
[are]{.mark} simply [incorrect]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally, I link the
problems with "substantial" with the controversy over judicial activism,
and argue that because our legal system values judicial restraint, [we
should feel uneasy when judges use the word.]{.underline} Because I
believe the present discussion can only begin after understanding the
etymological and philosophical roots of the word "substantial," I begin
with a brief overview of those topics and a look at current definitions
of the word. Then, I turn in Part III to a discussion of the word's
prevalence and confused use in legal writing.8 In Part IV, I examine two
death penalty cases in which the Supreme Court considered the import of
the word "substantial" in jury charges. In Part V, I respond to the
contextualists' argument that all words are indeterminate, signifying
little outside of a particular context. Finally, in Part VI, I contend
that while good legislation may make use of the word "substantial," good
jurisprudence should not.

#### Legal code defines substantial anywhere between .1 and 55 percent

**Malaguli 11**, (Ransmeier & Spellman Law Firm, SUBSTANTIAL CONFUSION:
The Use and Misuse of the Word \"Substantial\" in the Legal Profession)

III\. PROBLEMS WITH THE MODERN DEFINITION This section explores the
inconsistency within [[the "modern" (]{.mark}and most prevalent)
[definition]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the definition that [[focuses on
size]{.underline}]{.mark}. A comparison of three cases yields an
illustrative example of this inconsistency. In the first case, the
Maryland Supreme Court considered whether a business displaying adult
material was permitted under local zoning laws. The Carroll County
(Maryland) Code "permits an 'adult entertainment business' in an IG
General Industrial Zone, but in no other zone. The term 'adult
entertainment business' is defined in the code . . . as an . . . 'adult
store.'"56 An adult store, in turn, is defined as "a business
establishment that offers for sale or rental 'any printed, recorded,
photographed, filmed or otherwise viewable material, or any sexually
oriented paraphernalia, if a substantial portion of the stock or trade
is characterized by an emphasis on matters depicting, describing or
relating to sexual activities.'"57 Under the county code, a "substantial
portion" is present where "\[a\]t least 20% of the stock in the
establishment or on display consists of matters or houses devices
depicting, describing or relating to sexual activities; or \[a\]t least
20% of the usable floor area is used for the display or storage of
matters or devices depicting, describing or relating to sexual
activities.58 The district court found that the store was being operated
as an illegal adult store under the statute. 59The Maryland Supreme
Court dismissed its grant of certiorari as improvidently granted,
thereby upholding the intermediate appeals court's reversal of the
district court's ruling that the defendant in the case was operating an
illegal adult store. Neither appellate court reached the question of
substantiality. The second case was authored by the Kansas Court of
Appeals. Kansas Statute 75-4305 provides: (a) Any local governmental
officer or employee who has not filed a disclosure of substantial
interests shall, before acting upon any matter which will affect any
business in which the officer or employee has a substantial interest,
file a written report of the nature of the interest with the county
election officer of the county in which is located all or the largest
geographical part of the officer's or employee's governmental
subdivision.60 Kansas law defines a "substantial interest" as being
present: (1) If an individual or an individual's spouse, either
individually or collectively, has owned within the preceding 12 months a
legal or equitable interest exceeding \$5,000 or 5% of any business,
whichever is less . . . . (2) If an individual or an individual's
spouse, either individually or collectively, has received during the
preceding calendar year compensation which is or will be required to be
included as taxable income on federal income tax returns of the
individual and spouse in an aggregate amount of \$2,000 from any
business or combination of businesses . . . . (3) If an individual or an
individual's spouse, either individually or collectively, has received
in the preceding 12 months, without reasonable and valuable
consideration, goods or services having an aggregate value of \$500 or
more from a business or combination of businesses . . . . (4) If an
individual or an individual's spouse holds the position of officer,
director, associate, partner or proprietor of any business, other than
an organization exempt from federal taxation of corporations under
section 501(c)(3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (10) or (19) of chapter 26 of the
United States code . . . . (5) If an individual or an individual's
spouse receives compensation which is a portion or percentage of each
separate fee or commission paid to a business or combination of
businesses . . . . Interpreting these statutes, the Kansas Court of
Appeals held that a 55 percent equity interest in an entity qualifies as
a "substantial interest."61 In the last case, the Mississippi Supreme
Court went a step further than most courts in acknowledging that
"\[s\]ubstantial evidence \[is\] not easily defined."62 Notwithstanding
the difficulty, however, the Court boldly went on to state that
"\[s\]ubstantial evidence . . . means something more than a 'mere
scintilla' of evidence \[but\] that it does not rise to the level of 'a
preponderance of the evidence.'"63 Nevertheless, [[the court's
definition places "substantial]{.mark}" somewhere [between 0.1]{.mark}%
[and 50 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}.64 [[These]{.mark} cases [are a
clear example of legislatures and courts using the]{.mark} modern, [most
prevalent, definition of "substantial"]{.mark} -- the definition [that
focuses on size]{.mark}]{.underline}. They are particularly illustrative
because they happen to involve actual percentages. While it is
admittedly a slight oversimplification to say that **[[courts]{.mark}
and legislatures have [defined "substantial" to mean 0.1]{.mark}
percent, [20]{.mark} percent, [and 55 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
these examples do highlight with remarkable clarity [the ambiguity
inherent even within the modern sense of the term.]{.underline}65

### Should\-\--Mandatory

#### "Should" is mandatory

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009
People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [[the
**weight of authority**]{.mark} appears to [favor interpreting
\"should\" in an]{.mark} **imperative, [obligatory
sense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts, confronted with the
question of whether using the word \"should\" in jury instructions
conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections governing the
reasonable doubt standard, have upheld instructions using the word. [In
the courts of other states]{.underline} in which a defendant has argued
that the word \"should\" in the reasonable doubt instruction does not
sufficiently inform the jury that it is bound to find the defendant not
guilty if insufficient proof is submitted at trial, the courts have
squarely rejected the argument. They reasoned that [[the word]{.mark}
\"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and **[could not be
misunderstood]{.mark}**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v. McCloud,
257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v. State, 217
Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995) (finding
argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional to be
without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504 A.2d
940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting the
word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that [the word
conveys]{.mark}]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of [duty]{.mark} or
obligation and **[not discretion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In Little v.
State, 261 Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas
Supreme Court interpreted the word \"should\"]{.underline} in an
instruction on circumstantial evidence [as **[synonymous with]{.mark}
the word [\"must\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} and rejected the defendant\'s
argument that the jury may have been misled by the court\'s use of the
word in the instruction. Similarly, [the Missouri Supreme Court rejected
a defendant\'s argument that the court erred by not using the word
\"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on witness credibility [which
used the word \"must\" because the two words have the **same
meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958).
\[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the Arizona
Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s or
commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty** or
**obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

#### "Should" means must -- its mandatory

**Foresi 32** (Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis)

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
[\'should\']{.mark}]{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and [has
for]{.mark} one of its [meanings]{.mark} as]{.underline} defined in the
Century Dictionary: \"[[Obliged or compelled]{.mark} (to); would have
(to); [must]{.mark}; ought (to); used with an infinitive]{.underline}
(without to) [to express obligation, necessity or duty in connection
with some act yet to be carried out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear
that it is in that sense that the word \'should\' is used in this rule,
not merely advisory. When the judge in charging the jury tells them
that, unless they find from all the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged, they should
acquit[, the word [\'should\' is **not**]{.mark} **used in an
[advisory]{.mark} sense** [but has the force]{.mark} or meaning [of
\'must\']{.mark}, or \'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\]
[with it the sense of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty
[equivalent to **compulsion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A natural sense of
sympathy for a few unfortunate claimants who have been injured while
doing something in direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to
fritter away, or nullify, provisions which have been enacted to
safeguard and protect the welfare of thousands who are engaged in the
hazardous occupation of mining.

#### And/or means one or the other or both

**Pullum 8** (Geoffrey K., Professor of General Linguistics --
University of Edinburgh, "[And/or: \"and AND or\", or \"and OR
or\"?](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=35)", Language Log, 4-14,
http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=35)

[Does and/or mean \"and and or\", or \"and or or\"?]{.underline} That
is, if I say I am interested in *A* and/or *B*, do I mean I\'m
interested in *A* and *B* **and** I\'m interested in *A* or *B*, or do I
mean that I\'m interested in *A* and *B* **or** I\'m interested in *A*
or *B*? (You may want to say that it means I\'m interested in *A* and
*B* **and/or** I\'m interested in *A* or *B*; but in that case I repeat
my question.) [Having reflected on it]{.underline} for a little while,
[I am convinced that the answer has to be that]{.underline} [[A and/or B
must mean \"A and B or A or B\"]{.underline}.]{.mark} That is, if an
entity *A* is claimed to have the property of being *F and/or G*, the
claim amounts to saying that either (i) *A* has the property of being
both *F* and *G* or (ii) *A* has the property of being either *F* or
*G*. And to claim that *F* is a property of entities *A and/or B* is to
claim that either (i) *F* holds for *A* and *B* or (ii) *F* holds for
*A* or *B*. However, in that case [[and/or is effectively]{.mark}
identical in meaning with [or]{.mark}]{.underline}, so it is at first
rather hard to see why *and/or* exists at all. But I do have a guess.
The right theory of what *or* means in English is that it is in general
inclusive but that sometimes the exclusive special case is conveyed as a
conversational implicature. *I\'m going to study linguistics at either
York or Edinburgh* would often be taken to have the exclusive sense:
since you typically go to a single university to take a single degree,
and during the degree course you have no time to study elsewhere, a
decision to choose York would normally exclude choosing Edinburgh as
well. The exclusive sense is thus conveyed: one or the other of York and
Edinburgh will be chosen, and if it is York it will not be Edinburgh,
and if it is Edinburgh it will not be York. But of course if you think
about it, someone who says she is choosing between those two
universities does not commit herself for life to never studying at the
other. When the two alternatives exclude each other, then the exclusive
meaning is the only one that makes sense. If you are asked whether you
want to sit in the stalls or in the balcony, it\'s one or the other but
not both, because you can only be in one place at one time. [[When they
don\'t exclude]{.mark} each other,]{.underline} [[it\'s]{.underline}
[always understood]{.underline} [that or allows for
both]{.underline}]{.mark}: [obviously someone whose ambition is to
win]{.underline} either [an Oscar or an Olympic]{.underline} [medal
wouldn\'t feel a failure if they won both]{.underline}. Winning both
would satisfy the ambition in spades. So my guess would be that *and/or*
is a way of underlining the point that the *or* is to be understood in
its inclusive sense rather than its exclusive sense. Sometimes you want
to explicitly indicate \"or more than one of the above\", and *and/or*
does that. Take the first example of *and/or* in the *Wall Street
Journal* corpus of 1987-1989 (a 44-million-word collection of random
articles that linguists often use as a source for real-life examples
because the Linguistic Data Consortium --- the host for the giant
Language Log servers --- made it available in 1993 nice and cheap). The
example (which actually happens to be a quotation from the *Washington
Post*) is this: *Too many of his attitudes, claims and complaints are
careless, conflicting, dubious, inaccurate, mean, petty, simplistic,
superficial, uninformed and/or pointlessly biased.* I take it as obvious
that if one hundred percent of the hapless man\'s attitudes, claims and
complaints had all ten properties --- every single one was careless and
conflicting and dubious and inaccurate and mean and petty and simplistic
and superficial and uninformed and pointlessly biased --- then the
quoted claim would be regarded as true, not false. [[An or would have
done the job]{.mark} here, [but the and/or injects a]{.mark} (logically
redundant) [reminder]{.mark}]{.underline} that it may well be the case
that more than one of the list of ten properties applies to the
miserable individual in question.

#### X or Y or both

**Wood 1** (Diane P., Circuit Judge -- United States Court of Appeals,
"Susan E. Hess, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Hartford Life & Accident
Insurance Company", 12-13,
http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=7th&navby=case&no=002043)

Having determined that Hess\'s 1996 employment contract is properly a
part of the administrative record the district court was entitled to
consider, we must next decide whether Hartford could reasonably have
determined that Hess\'s benefits as of April 19, 1996, should have been
based only on her 1995 draw amount. Like the district court, we cannot
read the contract that way. Hess\'s 1996 contract clearly states that
the draw system was to be phased out as of April 5. The contract also
specifies that her benefits, including long-term disability benefits,
would be calculated based on her \"base salary and/or draw.\" (We note
in passing that [the phrase [\"and/or\" has]{.mark} its
critics]{.underline}. Bryan A. Garner reports in A Dictionary of Modern
Legal Usage 56 (2d ed. 1995), that \"and/or has been vilified for most
of its life\-- and rightly so.\" He goes on to say, however, that [the
expression]{.underline}, while \"undeniably clumsy[, does have a
[specific meaning (x and/or y = x or y or both]{.mark}).\"]{.underline}
Id.) [Here, this would mean that Hess could have her benefits calculated
on the basis of]{.underline} her base [salary, or]{.underline} her
[draw, or both]{.underline}. In the context of Fleet\'s transition away
from a draw system, the only reasonable interpretation of this provision
was that the benefits would be based on the draw while it was in effect
and on the base salary thereafter. As of April 5, Hess was thus
contractually entitled to a benefits package based on her base
salary\--that is, based on the average of her previous two years\'
commissions. The fact that Fleet may have breached the contract (or been
slow in implementing its details) by failing to move from the draw
system to the base salary system until June 1 does not change the
package of compensation and benefits to which Hess was contractually
entitled. Nor could the fact that Fleet failed to inform Hartford about
the date the change-over was to have occurred affect Hess\'s benefit
amount. The Hartford policy states that \"\[i\]f \[Fleet\] gives The
Hartford any incorrect information, the relevant facts will be
determined\" to establish the correct benefit amount. Once informed by
Hess\'s attorney that Hess believed the information Fleet provided
Hartford was incorrect, it was incumbent on the examiner to refer to
Hess\'s employment contract to determine her actual regular monthly pay.
Had he done so, he would have seen that Hess became entitled to the
higher level of benefits on April 5, two weeks before her disability.
The district court therefore did not err when it concluded that
Hartford\'s failure to consider the contract was arbitrary and
capricious.

note]{.underline} Rules similar to those for choosing between shall and

have had little effect on usage. In most constructions, would is the
auxiliary chosen regardless of the person of the subject: If our allies
would support the move, we would abandon any claim to sovereignty. You
would be surprised at the complexity of the directions. Because the main
function of should in modern American English is to express duty,
necessity, etc. ( You should get your flu shot before winter comes ),
its use for other purposes, as to form a subjunctive, can produce
ambiguity, at least initially: I should get my flu shot if I were you.
Furthermore, should seems an affectation to many Americans when used in
certain constructions quite common in British English: Had I been
informed, I should (American would ) have called immediately. I should
(American would ) really prefer a different arrangement. As with shall
and will, most educated native speakers of American English do not
follow the textbook rule in making a choice between should and would.

**AC 99** (Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
<http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html>)

shall

[[\'shall\' describes something]{.mark} that is
[mandatory]{.mark}]{.underline}. If a requirement uses \'shall\', then
that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied without fail. Noncompliance is
not allowed. Failure to comply with one single \'shall\' is sufficient
reason to reject the entire product. Indeed, it must be rejected under
these circumstances. Examples: \# \"Requirements shall make use of the
word \'shall\' only where compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good
example. \# \"C++ code shall have comments every 5th line.\" This is a
bad example. Using \'shall\' here is too strong.

should

[[\'should\' is weaker]{.mark}. It describes [something]{.mark} that
might not be satisfied in the final product, but that is
[desirable]{.mark} enough]{.underline} that any noncompliance shall be
explicitly justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined
carefully, as it probably means that something is not being stated
clearly. If a \'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be
discarded entirely, so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should
be ANSI compliant.\" A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI
compliant on all platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be
tested thoroughly.\" Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with
\'shall\' if this requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing
of defining what \'thoroughly\' means).

[[United States]{.underline}]{.mark} or United States of America Abbr.
U.S. or US or U.S.A. or USA

[[A country]{.mark} of central and northwest North America [with
coastlines on the Atlantic and Pacific]{.mark} oceans]{.underline}. It
includes the noncontiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii and various
island territories in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The area now
occupied by the contiguous 48 states was originally inhabited by
numerous Native American peoples and was colonized beginning in the 16th
century by Spain, France, the Netherlands, and England. Great Britain
eventually controlled most of the Atlantic coast and, after the French
and Indian Wars (1754-1763), the Northwest Territory and Canada. The
original Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Great
Britain in 1776 and formed a government under the Articles of
Confederation in 1781, adopting (1787) a new constitution that went into
effect after 1789. The nation soon began to expand westward. Growing
tensions over the issue of Black slavery divided the country along
geographic lines, sparking the secession of the South and the Civil War
(1861-1865). The remainder of the 19th century was marked by increased
westward expansion, industrialization, and the influx of millions of
immigrants. The United States entered World War II after the Japanese
attack (1941) on Pearl Harbor and emerged after the war as a world
power. Washington, D.C., is the capital and New York the largest city.
Population: 302,000,000.

#### "United States" includes the federal government

**National Atlas 13** -- "Government of the United States", 1-14,
<http://www.nationalatlas.gov/government.html>

Introduction

The United States of America is a democracy, which means it is governed
by the will of its people. Its government provides a system of
management for American citizens. Established in 1789, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is a federal
republic]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a strong democratic tradition. Its
legal system is based on English common law. [The [government is divided
into separate]{.mark} governing [units]{.mark}. At [the top]{.mark}
level [is]{.mark} the [Federal]{.mark} Government]{.underline}, which
provides functions that are best managed by a centralized government,
such as defense, currency regulation, and foreign relations. Its capital
city is Washington, D.C.

Federal Government

At the Federal level, there are three branches of government: executive,
legislative, and judicial. These branches work in concert under a set of
checks and balances that ensure a relatively even distribution of
authority and power.

**Allen 93** (Robert, Editor and Director -- The Chambers Dictionary,
Does Grammar Matter?)

**[[Grammar matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, [because [it is
the]{.mark} accepted [way of using language]{.mark}]{.underline},
whatever one's exact interpretation of the term. [[Incorrect grammar
hampers]{.mark} [communication]{.mark}, which is the whole purpose of
language]{.underline}. The [[grammar]{.underline}]{.mark} of standard
English matters because it [[is a codification]{.mark} of the way using
English that most people]{.underline} will [find

### Precision

#### Legal precisions outweighs limits and ground \-\-- it's a prerequisite to effective policy education

**Shannon 2** -- Bradley Shannon, law at University of Idaho, January
2002 (Washington Law Review, 77 Wash. L. Rev. 65, Lexis

The first answer to this question is, why should we not care? If proper
terminology (of whatever type) is readily available and comprehendible,
why should one not want to use it? Does one really need a reason for not
misusing any word, technical or otherwise? In other words,
[[though]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[misuses of]{.underline}]{.mark}
Rules [[terminology might not]{.underline} **[seem to]{.underline}**
[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} [serious [problems]{.mark}]{.underline},
surely [[that is not an argument in favor of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[disregard]{.underline}]{.mark} of proper Rules terminology,
particularly where the cost of using proper terminology is negligible.
79

The second answer to the question why [[we should
care]{.underline}]{.mark} about the use of proper Rules terminology goes
to the cost of using improper terminology **[[even
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** seemingly [**[trivial contexts]{.mark}**.
[Understanding legal concepts is difficult enough without]{.mark} the
[**confusion** created when an inappropriate term is used]{.mark} to
represent those concepts]{.underline}. And [[this is true]{.mark}
[**regardless of how minor** the misuse]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some
sense, [**[every misuse]{.mark}** of legal language
[impedes]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} -
and, consequently, the progress - of the law.

### A2: Aff Flexibility

#### Strict limits *enable* creativity. Beauty emerges from [identifying constraints]{.underline} and [working within them]{.underline}. 

**Flood 10** (Scott, BS in Communication and Theatre Arts -- St.
Joseph's College, School Board Member -- Plainfield Community School
Corporation, and Advertising Agent, "Business Innovation -- Real
Creativity Happens Inside the Box",
http://ezinearticles.com/?Business-Innovation\-\--Real-Creativity-Happens-Inside-the-Box&id=4793692)

It seems that we can accomplish anything if we\'re brave enough to step
out of that bad, bad box, and [[think]{.mark}ing [\"creatively\"
has]{.mark} come [to be]{.mark} synonymous with [ignoring
rules]{.mark}]{.underline} and constraints or pretending they just
don\'t exist. [**[Nonsense]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Real creativity is
put to the test within the box. In fact, that\'s where it really shines.
It might surprise you, but [[it\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[easier to think outside the box than within]{.mark} its
confines]{.underline}. How can that be? It\'s simple. When you\'re
working [outside the box, you don\'t face rules]{.underline}, or
boundaries, or assumptions. You create your own as you go along. If you
want to throw convention aside, you can do it. If you want to throw
proven practices out the window, have at it. You have the freedom to
create your own world. Now, I\'m not saying there\'s anything wrong with
thinking outside the box. At times, it\'s absolutely essential - such as
when you\'re facing the biggest oil spill in history in an environment
in which all the known approaches are failing. But most of us don\'t
have the luxury of being able to operate outside the box. We\'ve been
shoved into reality, facing a variety of limitations, from budgets, to
supervisors\' opinions and prejudices, to the nature of the marketplace.
Even though the box may have been given a bad name, it\'s where most of
us have to spend our time. And no matter how much we may fret about
those limits, inside that box is where we need to prove ourselves. If
you\'ll pardon the inevitable sports analogy, [consider a baseball
player who belts ball after ball]{.underline} over 450 feet.
[Unfortunately]{.underline}, he has a wee problem: [he can\'t place
those]{.underline} hits [between the foul lines]{.underline}, so
they\'re harmful strikes instead of game-winning home runs. To the
out-of-the-box advocates, he\'s a mighty slugger who deserves
admiration, but [to his]{.underline} teammates and the [fans, he\'s a
loser]{.underline} who just can\'t get on base. He may not like the fact
that he has [to limit his hits]{.underline} to [between the foul
poles]{.underline}, but that\'s one of the realities of the game he
chose to play. The same is true of ideas and approaches. [The
most]{.underline} dazzling and [impressive tactic is essentially
useless]{.underline} if it doesn\'t offer a practical, realistic way to
address the need or application. [Like the baseball player,
we]{.underline} may not like the realities, but we [have to operate
within]{.underline} their [limits]{.underline}. Often, I\'ve seen people
blame the box for their inability or unwillingness to create something
workable. For example, back in my ad agency days, I remember fellow
writers and designers complaining about the limitations of projects. If
it was a half-page ad, they didn\'t feel they could truly be creative
unless the space was expanded to a full page. If they were given a full
page, they demanded a spread. Handed a spread, they\'d fret because it
wasn\'t a TV commercial. If the project became a TV commercial with a
\$25,000 budget, they\'d grouse about not having a \$50,000 budget. Yet
[[the **greatest artists**]{.underline}]{.mark} of all time [[didn\'t
complain]{.mark} about what they didn\'t have; [they worked]{.mark}
their [magic using what they did. Monet captured]{.mark}]{.underline}
the grace and [[beauty]{.underline}]{.mark} of France astonishingly well
[[within]{.mark} the bounds of [a canvas]{.mark}. [Donatello]{.mark}
exposed]{.underline} the breathtaking [emotion]{.underline} that lurked
[[within]{.mark} ordinary chunks of [marble]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[[I doubt]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Beethoven]{.underline}]{.mark}
ever [[whined because there were only 88 keys]{.mark} on the
piano]{.underline}. Similarly, I\'ve watched the best of my peers do
amazing things in less-than-favorable circumstances. There were
brilliant commercials developed with minimal budgets and hand-held
cameras. Black-and-white ads that outperformed their colorful
competitors. Simple postcards that grabbed the attention of (and
business from) jaded consumers. You see, real creativity isn\'t hampered
or blocked by limits. It actually flowers in response to challenges.
Even though it may be forced to remain inside the box, it leverages
everything it can find in that box and makes the most of every bit of
it. [**Real [creativity]{.mark}** [is driven by a **need** to
create]{.mark}. When Monet approached a]{.underline} blank
[canvas,]{.underline} it\'s safe to say that [he didn\'t agonize over
its size]{.underline}. He wanted to capture something he\'d seen and
share how it looked through his eyes. The size of the canvas was
incidental to his talent and desire. [Think about]{.underline} the
[[Apollo 13]{.underline}]{.mark} mission. [NASA]{.underline} didn\'t
have the luxury of flying supplies or extra tools to the crew. They
[[couldn\'t rewrite]{.underline}]{.mark} the laws of
[[physics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Plus, they faced a rapidly shrinking
timeline, so their box kept getting smaller and less forgiving. And
[[yet they arrived upon a solution]{.mark} that was
creative]{.underline}; more important, that was successful. [[The next
time someone tells you]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} real [[solution involves]{.mark} [stepping
out]{.mark}side the box, **[challenge him or her]{.mark} to think and
work harder**]{.underline}. After all[, [the **best solution**
may]{.underline}]{.mark} very well [[be]{.mark} lurking [in a
corner]{.mark} of that familiar box]{.underline}.

### A2: Breadth Good

#### Depth is more educational than breadth \-\-- studies prove

**WP 9** (Washington Post, "Will Depth Replace Breadth in Schools?"
http://voices.washingtonpost.com/class-struggle/2009/02/will_depth_replace_breadth_in.html)

The truth, of course, is that students need both. Teachers try to mix
the two in ways that make sense to them and their students. But
[[a]{.mark} surprising [study]{.mark}]{.underline} --- certain to be a
hot topic in teacher lounges and education schools --- [[is
providing]{.mark} new [data]{.mark} that suggest [educators should
spend]{.mark} much [more time on a **few issues**]{.mark} and **let some
topics slide**]{.underline}. Based on a sample of 8,310 undergraduates,
the national study says that students who spend at least a month on just
one topic in a high school science course get better grades in a
freshman college course in that subject than students whose high school
courses were more balanced. The study, appearing in the July issue of
the journal Science Education, is "Depth Versus Breadth: How Content
Coverage in High School Science Courses Relates to Later Success in
College Science Coursework." The authors are Marc S. Schwartz of the
University of Texas at Arlington, Philip M. Sadler and Gerhard Sonnert
of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Robert H. Tai of
the University of Virginia. This is more rich ore from a goldmine of a
survey Sadler and Tai helped organize called "Factors Influencing
College Science Success." It involved 18,000 undergraduates, plus their
professors, in 67 colleges in 31 states. The study weighs in on one side
of a contentious issue that will be getting national attention this
September when the College Board's Advanced Placement program unveils
its major overhaul of its college-level science exams for high school
students. AP is following a direction taken by its smaller counterpart,
the International Baccalaureate program. IB teachers already are allowed
to focus on topics of their choice. Their students can deal with just a
few topics on exams, because they have a wide choice of questions. AP's
exact approach is not clear yet, but College Board officials said they
too will embrace depth. They have been getting much praise for this from
the National Science Foundation, which funded the new study. Sadler and
Tai have previously hinted at where this was going. In 2001 they
reported that students who did not use a textbook in high school
physics---an indication that their teachers disdained hitting every
topic --- achieved higher college grades than those who used a textbook.
Some educators, pundits, parents and students will object, I suspect, to
sidelining their favorite subjects and spending more time on what they
consider trivial or dangerous topics. Some will fret over the
possibility that teachers might abandon breadth altogether and wallow in
their specialties. Even non-science courses could be affected. Imagine a
U.S. history course that is nothing but lives of generals, or a required
English course that assigns only Jane Austen. "Depth Versus Breadth"
analyzes undergraduate answers to detailed questions about their high
school study of physics, chemistry and biology, and the grades they
received in freshman college science courses. [The]{.underline} college
[grades of students who had studied]{.underline} at least [one
topic]{.underline} for at least a month in a high school science course
[were compared to]{.underline} those of [students who did not
experience]{.underline} such [depth]{.underline}. The study acknowledges
that the [[pro-breadth forces have been in retreat. **Several** national
commissions]{.mark} have [called for more depth]{.mark} in]{.underline}
science [teaching]{.underline} and other subjects. [A]{.underline} 2005
[study of 46 countries found that [those whose schools had the
best]{.mark} science test [scores covered]{.mark} far [fewer
topics]{.mark} than U.S. schools]{.underline}.

#### Especially for [high school]{.underline} students

**SD 9** (Science Daily, "Students Benefit From Depth, Rather Than
Breadth, In High School Science Courses",
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090305131814.htm)

[A]{.underline} recent [study reports]{.underline} that [[**high
school** students who study fewer]{.underline}]{.mark} science
[[topics]{.mark}, but study them [in]{.mark}]{.underline} greater
[[depth, have an advantage in college]{.underline}]{.mark} science
classes over their peers who study more topics and spend less time on
each. Robert [Tai, associate professor]{.underline} at the University of
Virginia\'s Curry School of Education, worked with Marc S. Schwartz of
the University of Texas at Arlington and Philip M. Sadler and Gerhard
Sonnert of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to conduct
the study and produce the report. The study relates the amount of
content covered on a particular topic in high school classes with
students\' performance in college-level science classes. \"As a former
high school teacher, I always worried about whether it was better to
teach less in greater depth or more with no real depth. This study
offers evidence that [[teaching fewer topics in]{.mark} greater [depth
is a better way to prepare]{.mark} students for success]{.underline} in
college science,\" Tai said. \"These results are based on the
performance of thousands of college science students from across the
United States.\" The 8,310 students in the study were enrolled in
introductory biology, chemistry or physics in randomly selected
four-year colleges and universities. Those who spent one month or more
studying one major topic in-depth in high school earned higher grades in
college science than their peers who studied more topics in the same
period of time. The study revealed that students in courses that focused
on mastering a particular topic were impacted twice as much as those in
courses that touched on every major topic. The study explored
differences between science disciplines, teacher decisions about
classroom activities, and out-of-class projects and homework. The
researchers carefully controlled for differences in student backgrounds.
The study also points out that standardized testing, which seeks to
measure overall knowledge in an entire discipline, may not capture a
student\'s high level of mastery in a few key science topics. Teachers
who \"teach to the test\" may not be optimizing their students\' chance
of success in college science courses, Tai noted. \"President [Obama has
challenged the nation to become the most educated]{.underline} in the
world by having the largest proportion of college graduates among its
citizens in the coming decade,\" Tai said. \"[To meet this challenge,
[it is imperative]{.mark} that [we use]{.mark} the [research to
inform]{.mark} our [education]{.mark}al practice.\"]{.underline} The
study was part of the Factors Influencing College Science Success

The Taiwan Problem in US-China Relations

[While [the US-China relationship]{.mark} is perceived to be 'the most
consequential bilateral relationship of our time', it [has been beset
by]{.mark} a number of [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 [Arguably **[the
most significant issue]{.mark}** between the two countries [has
been]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} issue]{.underline}, that is, the
continued existence of a rump Republic of China (ROC) on the island of
Taiwan long after the Communist Party of China (CCP) had triumphed over
the Kuomintang (KMT) in the Chinese civil war of 1945-49 and established
the People's Republic of China (PRC). [For China, resolving the Taiwan
issue through reunification with the Mainland is a primary political
objective]{.underline} on account of the strong and emotive nationalist
sentiments surrounding the issue in China. [For many Chinese, Taiwan is
the one remaining scar from China's century of humiliation]{.underline}
at the hands of foreign imperialist powers and has to be 'recovered'
(i.e., reunified with the Mainland) to complete China's revolution begun
under Sun Yat-sen. Thus, according to Article 4 of China's
Anti-Secession Act of 2005, 'accomplishing the great task of reunifying
the motherland is the sacred duty of all Chinese people, the Taiwan
compatriots included.'2 [[Taiwan has]{.mark} therefore [been **a central
issue in US-China relations since**]{.mark} **the end of [World War
II]{.mark}**, and the Taiwan Strait crisis in]{.underline} 1995-[96
demonstrated how it could yet lead to open conflict between the two
great powers]{.underline}.

#### It's important to [debate]{.underline} U.S. Taiwan policy. 

**Hickey 15** --- Dennis V. Hickey, Distinguished Professor of Political

[[The world is changing. But]{.mark} the fundamentals of [U.S. policy
toward Taiwan]{.mark} have not changed for decades and]{.underline}
U.S.-Taiwan security ties [[remain]{.mark} largely [frozen]{.mark} in
time]{.underline}. Many policies that were deemed necessary in the 1970s
are obsolete today. Does this observation apply to America's defense
relationship with Taiwan?

To be sure, this question makes some uncomfortable. And Washington
should not rush to strengthen, revise or repeal the U.S. security
commitment to Taiwan. However, [it makes little sense to adopt an
inertial approach]{.underline} to the matter. [**[Irrespective of one's
position]{.mark} toward the Taiwan issue**, [there are questions]{.mark}
about this bilateral defense relationship [that deserve **thoughtful
study and debate** among Americans at]{.mark} both [the popular]{.mark}

Such has been the case with Taiwan. [[Despite the fact]{.mark} that

situation there is **getting tense**, Taiwan has been mentioned **only

Politically speaking, the lack of discussion on Taiwan is
understandable. Although in the long run China's rise presents the most
critical challenge to U.S. national interests, today terrorism and ISIS
loom much larger in the minds of most Americans.

But [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} China flexing its muscles in the South
China Sea and [[renewed uncertainty about the future of its relationship
with Taiwan, the next president]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**[won't have the luxury of ignoring

the campaign, but [generating **more debate** about how the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should
