Jo **Becker 17**, director of the children's rights division at Human
Rights Watch, et al., 2/15/17, "The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission
(TLHRC) holds a briefing on \"Combating Child Soldiering: A Pernicious
Form of Child Trafficking.\"," *Federal News Service*, Accessed via
Lexis Nexis.

So on the positive side, since 2000 over 100,000 children have been
released or demobilized from government militaries or armed groups
around the world. The number of countries where children are actively
fighting has reduced by about a third over the last 20 years. And [there
are 26 governments and armed groups that have signed **concrete
agreements**]{.underline} [with **U**nited **N**ations to end their use
of child soldiers]{.underline}.

But on the other hand, [there are some countries where the
problem]{.underline}, as Gen. Dallaire has pointed out, [has gotten much
worse]{.underline}. For example, in Yemen the rate of child recruitment
increased five times in just one year. In Afghanistan the rate of child
recruitment doubled between 2014 and 2015. In South Sudan the U.N.
believes that over 16,000 children have been recruited just in the last
three years since the conflict re-erupted there.

But today [I want to focus particularly on the role of the **U**nited
**S**tates in tackling this grave problem]{.underline}.

[To its credit, [the U.S. was one of the first]{.mark} countries [to
ratify the child soldiers treaty]{.mark}]{.underline} that was adopted
by the U.N. in the year 2000. [After the U.S. ratified, all four
branches of the U.S. Armed Forces immediately issued regulations to keep
troops that are under the age of 18 out of battle. And [that was]{.mark}
really [**important** to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[set a good example
for]{.mark} other [militaries worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

And then [in 2008]{.underline}, it\'s [to [Congress]{.mark}\'s great
credit]{.underline} that [it [decided to]{.mark} also [tackle this
problem]{.mark} by [using]{.mark} the U.S.]{.underline} [**[leverage
of]{.mark} U.S. [military assistance]{.mark}**. [It
adopted]{.mark}]{.underline} a piece of legislation called [[the
**C**]{.mark}hild **[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention
**[A]{.mark}**ct]{.underline}.

This was a bipartisan bill that was championed by Sen. Sam Brownback
from Kansas and Sen. Dick Durbin from Illinois. It received broad
support, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

[The principle]{.underline} behind this law [is very
simple]{.underline}. It\'s that [the **U**nited **S**tates should not be
providing military assistance that\'s funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars
to governments that use or support the use of child
soldiers]{.underline}.

This bill came into effect in 2010 under the Obama administration. [[It
calls on the State Department to issue a list every year of]{.mark} the
[governments]{.mark} that have been [recruiting child
soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}, using child soldiers or supporting
militias that do so. And in the last seven years that law has been in
effect, between six and 10 countries have been named every year. The
five countries that are consistently on the list from the very beginning
have been Congo, Burma, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

So [[the law provides]{.mark} the U.S. with]{.underline} **[[incredible
leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It tells foreign governments]{.mark}
if you want U.S. military assistance,]{.underline} [**[you can\'t use
child soldiers]{.underline}**. [That\'s a]{.underline}]{.mark} [pretty
**[heavy message]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And under this law we\'ve seen
some **real success stories**]{.underline}. [But we\'ve also seen some
real missed opportunities.]{.underline}

So a couple of examples of how [the law can]{.underline} be \-- can
[really make a difference]{.underline}. One is Congo.

So at the height of Congo\'s war there was 30,000 children fighting on
all sides: government, armed groups, militia. The government had a long
history of using child soldiers, and even promoting military commanders
that had used child soldiers in their ranks.

Now in 2011, shortly after the law went into effect, the U.S. announced
that under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, it was going to withhold
foreign military financing from Congo. And the year after that it
announced that not only would it withhold foreign military financing,
but it would also refuse to train Congolese battalions until Congo
signed a U.N. action plan to end its use of child soldiers.

Now Congo had been dragging its feet for seven years on signing this
plan. But after the U.S. made that announcement, it signed in five days.
And since then child recruitment by the government has reduced to almost
zero. That\'s a big change from 30,000 kids.

So this is a really concrete example of how this law has been used. We
also have positive examples from Rwanda where the U.S. cutting off aid
under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act helped lead to the dissolution
of an armed group in the DRC, the M23.

The threat of sanctions also persuaded Chad to end its use of child
soldiers. And it\'s been off the State Department\'s list now for the
last three years.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} at the same time, [[there are]{.mark} also
real **[missed opportunities]{.mark}**. Since the law went into effect
there have been 43 instances where the administration has had a chance
to use this law to persuade governments to change their
ways]{.underline}. [In 33 of those 43 cases the administration has
chosen to **give a waiver**]{.underline}, a national interest waiver,
[to allow military aid to continue to flow]{.underline}.

And as Jesse mentioned, in the first five years that the law was in
effect, the Simpson Center estimated that over \$1 billion that
could\'ve been sanctioned under this law was allowed to go to
governments using child soldiers.

In fact, the law has been used to only withhold about \$35 million, a
very small percentage of assistance that has gone to these governments.
[Virtually the only countries that have been blocked from getting
military assistance are those countries that were never scheduled to get
any aid in the first place.]{.underline}

So this is the situation. [The U.S. has an]{.underline} **[incredibly
powerful tool]{.underline}** [that it\'s not been using.]{.underline}
And so going forward [we hope]{.underline} that [members of
Congress]{.underline} will [really insist that the administration uses
this law effectively]{.underline} for its intended purpose [to keep U.S.
weapons out of the hands of child soldiers, and to **use leverage**
to]{.underline} try and **[influence foreign governments]{.underline}**
to end this scourge.

Thank you very much.

EAVES: Thank you both for those remarks. Well I guess we can just hop
right into just kind of a quick conversation about this.

Gen. Dallaire, you have been a real pioneer and outspoken advocate on
the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder.

You know when you hear soldiers who talk about being on the battlefield
and coming into contact with a child combatant, and having to make the
choice of whether or not they shoot a child. And talking about how that
hesitation in and of itself could cost the lives of their own men.

And I\'m just curious, what efforts are being made to address the
soldiers\' perspective, and the impact on those who may have to shoot a
child who is pointing a gun at them. I mean is this part of your effort
to reform the overall security sector and some of the training that you
do to disincentivize the use of children?

DALLAIRE: In fact it\'s one of the elements that we have been looking
at.

Being myself injured with PTSD from my experience in Rwanda. The number
of walking wounded that we have who have had to face children and gone
through the ethical and moral, particularly moral dilemmas of having to
use lethal force against children has created traumas that in fact stay
with them. And although treated are not necessarily attenuated.

And so one of the reasons why they find themselves in such a situation
is because there\'s only one of two answers they have. One is to
withdraw and give the opportunity to those who are using children to
gain the advantage. And in so doing not achieve the operational aim. Or
to use lethal force, and in so doing suffer the consequences.

Not long ago in Quebec City where I live, this sergeant came up to me
and we had a good talk. He had five missions under his belt. And we were
talking about his last mission. And I asked him what is job was.

And be broke down instantaneously. Eyes crying, knees shaking, unable to
talk. And when I was able to calm him down, he said \"general,\" he said
\"I was in the reconnaissance platoon in my battalion.\" He said,
\"I\'ve been back for over four years. I have not been able to hug my
children yet.\"

For the number of \-- we in looking at this problem find that if we can
train our military, giving them alternate tools to having to use lethal
force, we can reduce the number of casualties on our side.

But we\'re reducing the casualties on the other side. Because every time
we aren\'t killing those children there\'s an impact on the society in
which \-- from which they come from.

And so the aim is to give a more consistent capability to the forces
that face them, to reduce the scenarios of having to gun-to-gun
situation simply resolve itself by the use of genetic lethal force. But
in fact, having alternate opportunities.

We\'ve seen the introduction more of women into the front lines as being
an incredible impact, a force multiplier. Because ultimately they are
children. And there is a capability of influencing by the mere presence
of children. Particularly the girls that they face.

So we want to reduce casualties on our side, on their side and it be
more effective. And how we\'re doing that is by training.

But by lo and behold, we need people to train trainers. And that\'s
where we started last year with our pilot project of actually hiring and
training veterans. Veterans who\'ve been in the field. And giving them
not only some formal education and academic programs because we\'re
based at Dalhousie University, and given some good, solid political
science information. But the whole program all are doctrinal framework.

And what we\'re seeing is these veterans are able to go back and close
the loop of having left a mission, knowing \-- or missions where the
job\'s not finished. But now they\'re able to train other armies, to
professionalize other forces. That they are now going into the fray with
better tools than what we had, in order to reduce the impact of children
as an effective weapon. But also reducing the impact of having to use
lethal force against them.

And the veterans are proving to be a significant force multiplier. So
they\'re getting another lease on life by actually being there.

And during the last course we ran, two out of the 15 first cohort
actually came forward to their colleagues and said that they had killed
children. And it was the first time since they\'ve been back from
mission that they actually spoke of that. They never even spoke to the
therapist about it.

So there is a wonderful opportunity to give back by veterans into the
fray, and reduce the risks of casualties.

EAVES: Thank you.

And Jo, I remember that this line of reasoning came up in 2008 ahead of
the passage of the Child Soldier Prevention Act. And I think it was in
an Armed Services Committee hearing that someone made the point that you
know they never want to see a U.S. soldier faced with a decision of
pointing their gun at a child, particularly a child that may have been
armed by the U.S.

And [in the final law there was,]{.underline} as you mentioned,
[[this]{.mark} provision put in on [national security
waiver]{.mark}s.]{.underline} And which was a common practice. But one
that, as you pointed out, [[has been used]{.mark} quite
[excessively]{.mark} since 2010.]{.underline}

I was wondering if you could talk about the kind of waivers that have
been used. And then another part of this question is last year in
particular, Afghanistan was not listed, even though there was a sizable
chunk of military assistance that went to Afghanistan, particularly for
support of their national police, which they call \-- which the U.S.
government call a security force, and therefore not eligible under the
law.

So I\'m wondering if you can talk about the issue that\'s come up with
waivers and partial waivers. And then also what this \-- kind of this
latest issue that we\'ve uncovered with security forces, and what that
means for the future of the law.

BECKER: Sure.

First of all [it\'s important to understand that [the **C**]{.mark}hild
**[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention **[A]{.mark}**ct only
[applies to]{.mark} a limited number of military assistance
programs]{.underline}. So even if all of them are prohibited under the
law, it doesn\'t mean that there\'s no military assistance going to a
government of concern. [It applies to six categories,
including]{.underline} foreign military financing, [**[d]{.mark}**irect
**[c]{.mark}**ommercial **[s]{.mark}**ales, **[f]{.mark}**oreign
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[s]{.mark}**ales]{.underline}, IMET, et cetera.

But the law, as Jesse mentions, does give the president a national
security waiver option. And it\'s important to recognize that the U.S.
often has complicated interests with these countries. A country that
uses child soldiers, for example, may also be an important ally in the
War on Terror, for example.

[The president may have legitimate reasons to waive some of
the]{.underline} provisions of the law for U.S. interests. [But our
problem is that this has been the]{.underline} **[norm rather than the
exception]{.underline}**. The vast majority of cases that have come
before the president get waivers.

And there are two kinds of waivers. [The president can give a **full
waiver**]{.underline} to a country, [which means]{.underline} basically
[all]{.underline} of the affected [categories of military assistance
will continue]{.underline} to flow with no strings attached. So a
concrete example of this is Iraq.

Iraq appeared on the State Department\'s list for the first time in
2016. And that\'s because militia groups that are allied with the
government have been recruiting large numbers of child soldiers. But the
president issued a full waiver for Iraq, which means that there will be
no restrictions on Iraq linked to its use of child soldiers. It has no
incentives to address this phenomenon in these militia groups.

Now [on the other hand, there\'s a **partial waiver**]{.underline}
option, which is what we saw with Congo. So the U.S. did not cut off all
military assistance to Congo, but it took a couple of key military aid
packages that Congo cared about, and said we\'re withholding these until
we see some concrete action to end the use of child soldiers. And in
that case we saw that it worked.

So [that\'s sort of a good middle ground. To use a partial waiver as a
way of telling the government that yes, we value you and you know, your
role. We want to you know support you in some ways. But **we can\'t
support you fully**]{.underline} [until you deal with this serious
problem]{.underline}.

Now, Jesse, your second question\'s about Afghanistan. [In general we
have been pretty pleased with the way the State Department has **handled
the listing** of countries. The listing that they put out every
year]{.underline} of countries using child soldiers [tracks pretty
closely with what we see on the ground and what we see reported by the
**U**nited **N**ations]{.underline}. But there\'s been one glaring
exception, and that\'s Afghanistan.

For years there\'s been solidly documented use of child soldiers by
Afghan police forces. Now these are called police forces, but it\'s a
misnomer. These are militia groups that are actively fighting the
Taliban. And they are directly under Afghan government control. And yet
the State Department has argued that because they\'re called police,
they shouldn\'t be affected by this law.

So what it means is that there\'s been no listing of Afghanistan.
There\'s been no sanctions, no prohibitions against Afghanistan. Even
though Afghanistan has acknowledged that it has a problem. And it\'s
even signed an action plan with the U.N. to eliminate its use of child
soldiers.

So unfortunately there\'s yet another example where the U.S. has sort of
you know given up its leverage to make a real difference in a country
where child soldiers is a real problem.

DALLAIRE: Jesse, I want to \-- I think that there is an argument that
doesn\'t seem to come to the floor. I was there with Sen. Durbin
negotiating. And I was very disappointed with the waiver process.

Just as much as I\'m not happy with the fact that we can still recruit
in our militaries under the age of 18, the British, the Canadians, the
Australians, the Americans. Although we don\'t send them to operational
theaters, we still train them for being ready when they hit 18 to be
deployed.

I think the essence of it is that we don\'t bring to the floor enough
the fact that the use of child soldiers by either the non-state actors
or state actors, the belligerence simply continues to sustain the wars.
Because we\'re using a weapons system. We\'re using a means to continue
the fight.

In Jordan when we were there, the refugee camps, Syrian refugee camps,
they were recruiting 13-year-olds to go fight for the Free Syrian Army.
And all they are is cannon fodder. They just keep their fight going.

So if you shifted the idea that the child soldier sustains war, sustains
conflict, then I think there\'s better incentive for the United States
not to give up this opportunity of holding people accountable. Because
you\'re saying you keep using kids, they\'re keeping using kids. Ergo,
you\'re keeping the war going.

So pull out. Stop it. And that can be an incentive for the other side.
And then build on that.

And I would argue that you would potentially change the nature of the
argument like we\'re doing in South Sudan right now. Getting them to
stop on both sides to recruit child soldiers is one way of getting to
the table, because we\'re talking about children. But more importantly,
it is also a way of breaking the absolute power that they have by being
to recruit and mobilize on an unlimited scale this weapon.

EAVES: You have this very jarring description as the weapons system,
children as a weapons system. And I\'m curious. How much of the problem
is with state armies, police and militias, versus non- state actors?
Where are you seeing the use of this weapons system, the use of these
children?

DALLAIRE: With the U.N. and the help of organizations like Jo and
others, and we\'ve been working at it. There\'s now only seven countries
out of 194 that recruit them. Although there may be some doing it and
we\'re not necessarily fully aware of. But there\'s only these seven
countries. And they\'re wavering.

And so was we attempt to continue to influence them, not to use them.
Because we\'re proving that they\'re not that good a weapon system in
the first place. They\'re of limited value. If you really want to make
\-- if you were to win the conflict, they\'re \-- they have a limited
capability. And certainly a limited potential to increase your
capability.

However, it\'s in the non-state actors. And it\'s interesting that when
we attempt to go at non-state actors and try to get them to shift gears
in regards to child soldiers, we\'re not very much supported. People
don\'t want to fund people who want to go and try to make non- state
actors more responsible.

In fact, it\'s sort of a weird construct. And so we work with people
like Geneva Cole (ph), who are initiating new ways of communicating with
them.

When I was in South Sudan, I went in as an advocate, as a retired
commander. So I went and met with the general of, as an example, the
COBRA Force. And after two hours of talking and discussing, and ending
up by insulting them by saying how can you call yourself a general if
you\'re going to need kids to fight your war?

He released 300 children in that time. So we can use other means to get
at it. And I think that the more presence of not just the NGO world, but
ex-military and commanders in talking soldier-to-soldier we can actually
prove to them that they\'re in the wrong game. By basing their aim, long
or good or whatever, on the use of children.

BECKER: Can I just add something to that? I think that even though
numerically non-state actors, rebel groups outnumber the number of
governments using child soldiers, it\'s really important to pressure
those governments to abandon this practice.

Because [[as long as governments are using child soldiers]{.mark}, you
know [non-state actors, rebel groups]{.mark} will [have an
excuse]{.mark}]{.underline}. They\'ll point to the state and say if the
government is doing it, why can\'t we?

But [[if we]{.mark} can [eliminate it on the part of
governments]{.mark}, then [it\'s]{.mark} much [easier to go to non-state
actors and say]{.mark} if you want to be taken seriously, [if you want
to be]{.mark} seen as [credible, you need to]{.mark} be able
to]{.underline} **[[meet the laws of war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [just as
governments do.]{.underline}

DALLAIRE: As an example to reinforce, when I met with the south Sudanese
generals, I didn\'t go in there and tell them, you\'re using child
soldiers also and we\'re holding you accountable and you\'re a bad guy
and so on.

What I went in with \-- we went in and we said listen, we know you\'re
facing child soldiers by the non-state actors, by the rebel \-- what are
you doing? How are you handling that? How are you training your soldiers
to handle this? How are you neutralizing that?

And through the discussion of them trying to explain what they were
doing to try and make their child soldiers ineffective without affecting
their troops, we ended up talking about their child soldiers.

And so indirect approach can be sometimes very effective in these.
Because the ego of these people is so dominant that you can break it by
in fact making them realize that they\'re actually using children to
fight their war. Children are not there to fight adult wars.

EAVES: One final question. And then we\'re going to turn it over to the
audience to ask some questions. Jo, I\'m curious. Just based on your
experience so far with the Child Soldier Prevention Act, are there any
changes that can be made that can make it a more effective tool? What
can be done to give the U.S. the leverage that it needs to particularly
go after the state actors that are wielding such potential devastative
power?

BECKER: I think there are a couple of things that can be done.

I mean certainly [part of it lies with the administration and their
implementation of the law.]{.underline} And [really using it to **full
effect** by]{.underline} you know, [minimizing the use of
waivers]{.underline} whenever \-- in as many cases as possible. And
recognizing that, for example, in the case of Afghanistan you know
police forces that are actively engaged in combat need to be covered by
the law.

For that latter place, though, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[need]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[help from
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} you know
[clarify the law and articulate that that in fact is the
case]{.underline}. And you know we\'re interested too in talking with
members of Congress [about how we can [minimize]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[use of waivers]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Eliminating national interest waivers ensures effective application of the CSPA

Rachel **Stohl 16**, director of the Conventional Defense program at the
nonpartisan Stimson Center, et al., 11/30/16, "Obama\'s Lost Opportunity
on Child Soldiers",
https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-09-30/obamas-lost-opportunity-on-child-soldiers

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Child Soldiers Prevention Act [[(CSPA) is
intended to **leverage**]{.mark} coveted U.S. [**military
assistance**]{.mark} and encourage governments [to stop using children
in combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Signed into law in 2008, the CSPA took
effect in 2010 and restricts U.S. military support to countries
identified by the State Department as having recruited and used child
soldiers in their national militaries or government-supported armed
groups. If a country appears on the annual CSPA list, it may be
ineligible to receive U.S. weapons and military assistance in the
following fiscal year.

[[The president may]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [**[waive]{.mark}**
these [prohibitions]{.mark}]{.underline} (in part or in full) [[in the
name of]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. \"[[national interest]{.mark}\" and
allow offending countries to continue to receive arms]{.underline} and
assistance despite their recruitment and/or use of child soldiers. For
the last six years, the Obama administration has justified the use of
\"national interest\" waivers to support broader security concerns
including counterterrorism and efforts to fight non-state armed groups.

This year, 10 countries are identified on the CSPA list: Burma, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia,
South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Obama administration granted
full waivers to Burma, Iraq and Nigeria, partial waivers to the DRC,
Somalia, South Sudan and Rwanda and did not waive the prohibitions on
Sudan, Syria and Yemen \-- three countries that are not slated to
receive any U.S. military assistance or arms sales. In effect, [these
waivers will allow at least \$273 million in military assistance to flow
to countries known to be using child soldiers.]{.underline} This has
been a consistent pattern of behavior for the Obama administration. Over
the past six years, the administration has provided more than \$1.2
billion in military assistance and arms sales to the 13 countries
identified for recruiting and using child soldiers.

\[UNICEF: Nearly 50 Million Children \'Uprooted\' Worldwide\]

Many of the countries identified by the State Department this year have
appeared on the CSPA list since its inception, with five reappearing on
the list every year since 2010. Nearly all of these countries have
received either full or partial waivers at some point in time. Indeed,
this year, the president waived only the assistance it was planning to
provide and prohibited assistance that was never slated to be delivered.
Over the past six years, the administration has withheld just over \$56
million in military assistance and \$5 million in arms sales to
violating countries, or less than five percent of funds that would have
been restricted had it not used waivers. It is not difficult to prohibit
assistance that was never going to provided.

This last round of waiver determinations has cemented Obama\'s legacy on
preventing the use of child soldiers worldwide. Although there have been
some positive changes under the CSPA \-- some countries such as Chad
have been removed from the CSPA list when they have eliminated the use
of child soldiers \-- overall the Obama administration has been loathe
to leverage the full weight of the CSPA. [[Rather than using the CSPA as
a carrot]{.mark} to encourage governments to stop recruiting and using
child soldiers, [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has]{.mark}
largely [given a **free pass** to]{.mark} some of the world\'s worst
[violators]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, in the midst of the brutality of the conflict in South Sudan,
where forces on all sides of the conflict continue to use children to
wage war, the United States has waived Juba\'s sanctions in part based
on the justification that South Sudanese forces will continue to take
part in the hunt for soldiers in the Lord\'s Resistance Army \-- a group
infamous for its systematic kidnapping and use of child soldiers. The
irony of supporting one government that is using child soldiers to hunt
down a group that has relied upon child soldiers to wage war for decades
seems to be lost on the Obama administration, which has waived CSPA
prohibitions every year for South Sudan and permitted the country to
receive \$120 million in U.S. military assistance and more than \$20
million in U.S. arms sales.

During the course of its term, the Obama administration has [missed a
vital opportunity to ensure that the CSPA carries more weight than the
paper it\'s written on.]{.underline} The administration\'s habitual [use
of]{.underline} full or partial national interest
[[waivers]{.underline}]{.mark} has, in effect, [[void]{.mark}ed much of
[the act\'s potential]{.mark} impact to help improve]{.underline} the
[lives]{.underline} of children around the world. Instead of
incentivizing countries to demobilize child soldiers and prevent further
recruitment into military and/or paramilitary groups, the administration
[repeatedly sent a message to violating countries that they could
continue to use child soldiers with little to no
consequence.]{.underline}

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has a powerful tool]{.mark} to stop the internationally condemned
practice of child soldiers, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} due to political
considerations \-- notably the importance given to providing assistance
to help support counterterrorism efforts \-- [the CSPA [has fallen
short]{.mark} of its potential.]{.underline}

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has]{.mark} an [opportunity to **be a leader**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
efforts to limit and ultimately prevent the use of child soldiers.
[Although [the CSPA]{.mark} is not a panacea to stop the horrific
practice of child soldiers, it is a tool that [should be
used]{.mark}]{.underline} by the next administration [[to **promote
change in government behavior**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and protect the
most vulnerable]{.underline}**.** Children around the world deserve
better.

norms.]{.underline}"120 Commentators, such as Sarah H. Cleveland, have
concluded that [unilateral economic sanctions]{.underline} can [serve
this important and unique purpose]{.underline}, despite the
traditionally acknowledged negatives associated [with their method of
altering foreign states' behaviors.]{.underline}121
[Sanctions]{.underline} of this sort may actually
"[assist]{.underline}\[\] [in]{.underline} the [international
definition, promulgation, recognition, and domestic internalization of
human rights norms.]{.underline}"122 [[By]{.mark} merely
[promulgating]{.mark} unilateral economic [sanctions]{.mark}, nation-
[states are]{.mark}]{.underline}, in effect, "[[articulating]{.mark}
human rights [violations]{.mark} as the impetus for imposing sanctions
and [thereby contributing to]{.mark} state practice" of those
[norms]{.mark}.]{.underline}123

PART V: THE CHILD SOLDIER PREVENTION ACT OF 2008

A. The Promulgation & Purpose of the CSPA

On December 23, 2008, the U.S. Congress amended the William Wilberforce
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 and included
Title IV, which is now known as the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of
2008 (CSPA). The CSPA, given full effect in June of 2009, is a
unilateral, legislative act that bars the U.S. government from
providing, among other things, financial assistance to another
nation-states' government "that is clearly identified . . . for the most
recent year . . . as having governmental armed forces or
government-supported armed groups . . . that recruit child soldiers."136
Section 405 of the CSPA also requires the U.S. to go on international
excursions, conduct thorough investigations into any reports of child
soldier use, and prepare reports that document the U.S.'s findings.137

B. Noteworthy Strengths of the CSPA

In addition to defining international norms and drawing more attention
to those norms, [[states have]{.underline}]{.mark} the compelling
[[power to directly enforce]{.mark} their economic sanctions against
states that violate international human rights norms and
laws.]{.underline} The [General Assembly of [the UN does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} have this power.124 Albeit influential and
widely respected, the United Nations General Assembly is "empowered to
make only non-binding recommendations to States on international issues
within its competence."125 Therefore, General Assembly
[[resolutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, much like the aforementioned twenty
consecutive resolutions against the U.S.'s continued use of unilateral
economic sanctions against Cuba, [[are not binding]{.mark}
against]{.underline} UN [member states.]{.underline}126 So, "\[w\]hile
[the \[UN\]]{.underline} views its treaties and conventions as binding
on \[s\]tate \[p\]arties, it [has no police power mechanism to
enforce]{.underline} its [decisions]{.underline}; \[UN treaties\] are
'limited by the signatories' willingness to comply.'"127

[[This]{.mark} limitation]{.underline}, which negatively impacts the
effectiveness of UN-adopted treaties such as the OP-CRC, "[[make\[s\]
implementing procedures to abolish]{.mark} the [use of child soldiers
**unattainable without**]{.mark} **local and [national
efforts.]{.mark}**]{.underline}"128 Heather L. Carmody, capturing this
frustration in a 2012 article, writes,

[Although the international community]{.underline} has [condemned the
use of child soldiers, military recruiters continue to defy these
international norms.]{.underline} Moral condemnation or treaties
prohibiting child soldiers often fall on deaf ears in countries that are
torn by internal conflict, civil war, and poverty. Recruiters \[may\]
have reached such a state of violence that all standards of moral and
ethical conduct cease to exist or hold meaning. Releasing child soldiers
may be seen as impractical to a militia embroiled in a civil war, where
replenishing combatants is a constant preoccupation.129

Many scholars recognize this limitation of the United Nations General
Assembly's resolutions and similarly structured multilateral agreements,
citing the lack of police power as one major hindrance to getting state
offenders of international norms to respect and follow those norms.130

Andrew Philip of Amnesty International, commenting on child soldier
commanders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, once stated that such
commanders "know it's a war crime, but they seem to believe they'll
never be brought to justice. There is a sense of rampant impunity."131
[[The U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} and other influential states, on the
other hand, [[may implement]{.mark} unilateral economic [sanctions that
create a **direct incentive**]{.mark} for sanctioned states [to]{.mark}
observe and [comply with]{.mark} international human rights
[norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are codified by international
entities like the UN. Plainly stated, [unilateral economic sanctions go
a step beyond emphasizing the usual moral and ethical implications of a
state's violation of international human rights law]{.underline}; they
target states' economic stability, which has arguably accelerated
offending state's willingness to comply with international human rights
laws.132

Some scholars, in light of both the known benefits and drawbacks
associated with unilateral economic sanctions, have proposed that the
U.S. and other nation-states refine the drafting process of their
future, respective unilateral economic sanctions.133 [In order for the
U.S. to simultaneously strengthen both negative and positive human
rights through the use of these sanctions, it should only implement
smart sanctions, or sanctions that are "narrowly tailored to minimize
civilian suffering]{.underline} [through measures such as]{.underline}
visa denials and [the freezing of assets.]{.underline}"13

Essentially, unilateral economic sanctions simply lack balance when they
ignore the positive human rights of citizens within the sanctioned
state. The thoughtful drafting of sanctions, which take into account the
entire spectrum of foreign citizens' human rights, will likely garner
more support from the international community. Furthermore, [[the U.S.
should]{.mark} document and **[condemn international human rights
violations in an even-handed, uniform manner]{.mark}**]{.underline}.135
Unilateral economic sanctions that reflect the application of these
recommendations may help to promote the full spectrum of foreign
citizens' human rights and reduce the potential for sanction to
undermine the goal of promoting global respect for international human
rights law. [[Sanctions]{.mark} that fall short of]{.underline}
contemplating all of these [recommendations, [like the **C**]{.mark}hild
**[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention **[A]{.mark}**ct of
2008[,]{.mark} [need to be amended]{.mark} in order [to best promote
international human rights norms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The CSPA]{.underline}]{.mark}, albeit flawed, has several positive
attributes. These [positive attributes]{.underline}, when coupled with
smart reformation of the CSPA, [[could]{.mark} allow the Act to
[be]{.mark}come [an **excellent tool**]{.mark} **for the advancement of
the international community's interest of promoting global respect for
and observance of international human rights norms.**]{.underline} The
[CSPA's definition of]{.underline} the term "[child
soldier]{.underline}," for example, [is]{.underline} appropriately
representative of international principles, as it is [consistent with
the OP-CRC's definition.]{.underline} The term extends to:

(i) any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in
    hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces;

(ii) any person under 18 years of age who has been compulsorily
     recruited into governmental armed forces;

(iii) any person under 15 years of age who has been voluntarily
      recruited into governmental armed forces; or

(iv) any person under 18 years of age who has been recruited or used in
     hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of a
     state; and

> \(B\) includes any person described in clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of
> subparagraph (A) who is serving in any capacity, including in a
> support role such as a cook, porter, messenger, medic, guard, or sex
> slave.13

The CRC's definition of the term "child soldier," by following the
UN-adopted OP-CRC's definition, is in essence promoting international
human rights norms established by the UN. [The definition specifically
outlines exactly who the international community deems to be a child
soldier, which, thereby, standardizes the concept and provides a uniform
basis to judge whether or not a state has indeed violated international
human rights norms regarding the use of child soldiers.]{.underline}

\(1\) the United States Government . . . condemn the conscription,
forced recruitment, or use of children by governments, paramilitaries,
or other organizations;

\(2\) the United States Government . . . support and, to the extent
practicable, lead efforts to establish and uphold international
standards designed to end the abuse of human rights described in
paragraph (1); \[and\] \...

\(7\) \[the\] United States diplomatic missions in countries in which
governments use or tolerate child soldiers \[to\] . . . develop
strategies, as part of annual program planning---

\(A\) to promote efforts to end such abuse of human rights; and

\(B\) to identify and integrate global best practices, as available,
into such strategies to avoid duplication of efforts.140

Section 403(1) of the [[CSPA plainly condemns the use of child
soldiers]{.mark} by any state or armed group,]{.underline}141 [which
candidly aligns the interests of the U.S. with the interests of the
**U**nited **N**ations]{.underline} as outlined in Chapter 9, Articles
55 and 56 of the UN Charter.142 As previously stated, Article 56 of the
UN charter requires the U.S., as a UN member state, "to take . . .
separate action. . . for the achievement of the purposes set forth in
Article 55,"143 which requires the UN to promote "universal respect for,
and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without
distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion."144 Sections 403(2)
and 403(7) of the CSPA, [[while]{.mark} also [showing the U.S.'s
commitment to]{.mark} promoting respect for foreign citizens' human
rights, specifically [prioritize]{.mark} the promotion of [international
human rights standards]{.mark} or norms [over]{.mark} the U.S.'s own
[domestic standards]{.mark}, insofar as they may differ.]{.underline}145

Also, [[Congress]{.mark} seemingly [**promotes uniformity** in the
application of]{.mark} the [CSPA by requiring]{.mark} the Secretary of
State to produce and publish [an annual report]{.mark}]{.underline} that
describes "the use of child soldiers in each foreign country"146 and by
requiring the Secretary of State to "formally notify any government
identified" as in violation of the CSPA.147 [By requiring an annual
report including information as to a foreign nation-state's use of child
soldiers, the U.S. will be armed with data and, in theory, will be
better able to apply its unilateral economic sanctions consistently and
fairly according to each foreign state's progress or lack
thereof.]{.underline} Also, the state being sanctioned will be given
notice that it is in violation of international human rights standards,
which puts the nation on direct notice of its non-adherence to accepted
international human rights standards. Furthermore, [this reporting
mechanism]{.underline} also [provides other nation-states with an
opportunity to see how they each are perceived by the U.S. and within
the international community in regard to human rights
concerns.]{.underline}

Lastly[, the [unilateral sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} that may be
[applied to foreign states under the CSPA [are appropriately limited to
financial aid]{.mark} and assistance designated [for]{.mark} the
development of each eligible foreign state's
[military.]{.mark}]{.underline}148 The Act "prohibits the following
forms of assistance to governments that are identified in the list:
international military education and training, foreign military
financing, excess defense articles, section 1206 assistance, and the
issuance of licenses for direct commercial sales of military
equipment."149 [Therefore, the CSPA does not prohibit the U.S. from
providing non-military-related humanitarian aid to citizens of a nation,
whose government has violated the CSPA.]{.underline}150 [Based upon
these aforementioned strengths, [the CSPA has a]{.mark} relatively
[sturdy foundation, which **squares well with international human rights
standards**]{.mark} held by organizations such as the
UN.]{.underline}151

C. Salient Weaknesses of the CSPA

The [CSPA, albeit drafted in accordance with international human rights
standards, tells a very different story when it comes to the manner in
which the U.S. has applied the legislation.]{.underline}152 Frankly[,
[the Act]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[does not
appear]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[applied evenly in]{.mark} the
interest of promoting global respect for human rights, but]{.underline}
seems [rather]{.underline} to be applied **[[in accordance with]{.mark}
the [U.S.'s]{.mark} own domestic, political objectives and [foreign
policy interests.]{.mark}]{.underline}**153 Furthermore, the CSPA lacks
specificity and does not provide key benchmarks or measures on which the
U.S. may base its determination as to whether a foreign state is
actively doing enough in its mission to refrain from using children in
armed conflicts.

1\. The National Interest Waiver

The national interest waiver, or section 404(c) of the CSPA, allows the
President to unilaterally waive the CSPA's application to a nation-state
"if \[he\] determines that such waiver is in the national interest of
the United States."154 Any 404(c)(1) waiver of funds pursuant to the
CSPA will likely occur as a result of a nation-state's human right
violations, outlined within the annual Trafficking in Persons Report
(TIP Report).155 As acknowledged by the U.S. Department of State,
"\[t\]he CSPA requires publication in the annual TIP Report of a list of
foreign governments identified during the previous year as having
governmental armed forces or government-supported armed groups that
recruit and use child soldiers, as defined in the Act."156

In 2012, the CSPA cited seven countries whose governments have offended
the CSPA.157 Burma, Libya, South Sudan, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo were the offending countries listed
within the TIP Report.158 Of the seven nation-states listed within the
2012 report, four were receiving funds under the CSPA at and prior to
the time that the report was released.159

President Barack Obama's [[continued]{.mark}, selective [choice to
waive]{.mark} the CSPA's [applicability]{.mark} to]{.underline} certain
[violating foreign states seems to [offend]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[Act's explicit [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} "support. . . and, to the extent practicable,
[[**lead efforts to establish and uphold international standards**
designed to end the abuse of human rights.]{.underline}]{.mark}"160
Currently, three of those four nation-states, which include Libya, South
Sudan, and Yemen, continue to receive full funding otherwise prohibited
by the CSPA due to President Obama's waiver of the Act's application to
those states.161 President Obama has also allowed the fourth
nationstate, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to receive partial
funding by exercising his waiver authority.162

#### Revitalizing human rights promotion is key to American leadership

Amanda **Schnetzer 16**, a Fellow in Global Initiatives at the George W.
Bush Presidential Center, 7/21/16, "Why promoting freedom and human
rights is in our national interest,"
https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2016/07/why-promoting-freedom-is-in-national-interest.html

Substantially more people experience liberty today than at the end of
World War II, but [more than half the world's population still lives in
countries where basic political rights and civil liberties are only
partly respected, if at all]{.underline}. The last decade in particular
has not been good for freedom.

For ten consecutive years, Freedom House has documented [a worrisome
"decline in global freedom."]{.underline} The National Endowment for
Democracy has warned of [authoritarian regimes cracking down at home
while also "seeking to reshape the international order and democratic
norms."]{.underline}

[[From China to Russia]{.mark} to the Middle East, the [challengers to
liberalism are gaining]{.mark} ground. [It is in the direct]{.mark} and
immediate [interest of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[to]{.mark} help [**shift the balance** by supporting]{.mark} the
advance of **[human rights]{.mark}** and freedom
[abroad]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The current mood in the United States does not appear conducive to this
strategy. New Pew Research polling shows that 69 percent of Americans
believe the United States should "concentrate more on our own national
problems." Seventy percent want the next U.S. president to focus on
domestic policy over foreign policy.

Yet [[in order to address]{.underline}]{.mark} the "[major
threats]{.underline}" that keep Americans awake at night ---
**[[ISIS]{.mark}, foreign [cyberattacks, global economic
instability,]{.mark} the spread of infectious [disease]{.mark}s, the
[refugee crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}--- **[[strong U.S.
leadership is required]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as are strategies that
help advance rule of law, good governance, open markets, and other
features of free societies.

So where do we go from here?

[One step would be for policymakers]{.underline}, presidential
candidates, and other public office hopefuls [to make the promotion of
democracy and human rights an important part of their foreign policy
agendas]{.underline}. This March, 139 policy experts, civil society
leaders, and former elected officials---Republicans and Democrats
alike---signed a letter encouraging the presidential candidates to do
just that.

While recognizing that "democracy and human rights cannot be the only
items on the foreign policy agenda," the letter calls it a "false
choice" to pit the pursuit of democratic ideals against national
security. I was proud to sign that letter.

A second step would be to engage the American people in a conversation
about the impact of advancing freedom on our own peace, prosperity, and
security.

At the end of World War II, for example, many questioned whether
democracy was compatible with Germany and Japan. The United States
actively supported the development of democratic institutions and
practices. Today, Germany and Japan are among our strongest partners and
allies in the world, and Americans reap tangible benefits.

In North Texas, where the Bush Institute is located, the relocation of
Toyota's North American headquarters is expected to create jobs and have
an economic impact of \$7 billion in the first ten years, according to
estimates when the move was announced.

[[During the Cold War, the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[supported democratic reform]{.mark} in places like Taiwan, South Korea,
the Philippines, and [Chile]{.mark}. The end of the Cold War was a major
victory for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe. After decades of
Soviet nuclear threat, it also was a great victory for American peace
and security.]{.underline}

[Today,]{.underline} [the **moral and strategic imperatives** [of
advancing human rights]{.mark} are just as compelling.]{.underline} In
Afghanistan, investing in women [[promotes stability and helps reduce
the possibility of]{.underline}]{.mark} future [[**terrorist attacks**
on the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} emanating
from that country[. In the Middle East, the spread of Islamic extremism
and ISIS has had devastating consequences, and the United States is not
immune. In North Korea, a regime that systematically and horrifically
abuses the rights of its own people seeks nuclear weapons that can reach
our shores.]{.underline}

In these and other places, [it is in the interests of the United States
to see the forces of freedom eventually prevail.]{.underline}

A third step would be to find opportunities for immediate bipartisan
action. Both Republican and Democrat presidents have affirmed the U.S.
commitment to standing for freedom at home and leading the advance of
freedom abroad. Congress, too, has played an important role.

Ensuring continued support for democracy and development assistance
overseas, promoting progress on human rights in trade and economic
agreements, and continuing support for initiatives like the President\'s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that relieve human suffering are
just some of the options available to policymakers today.

[In the current political environment, this may be a tall order, but the
stakes at home and abroad are high and **[American leadership is
essential]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### That solves extinction

Max **Yulis 17**, writer for the Penn Political Review, 4/8/17, "In
Defense of Liberal Internationalism,"
http://pennpoliticalreview.org/2017/04/in-defense-of-liberal-internationalism/

Over the past decade, [international [headlines]{.mark} have been
[bombard]{.mark}ed with stories [about]{.mark} the [**unraveling** of
the]{.mark} post-Cold War **[world order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
[creation of revolutionary smart devices and **[military
tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}, [the rise of militant **jihadist
organizations**]{.underline}, [and **[nuclear
prolif]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. Indeed, [times are paradoxically
**promising and alarming**]{.underline}. In relation to treating the
world's ills, fortunately, [[there is a capable
hegemon]{.underline}]{.mark}-- [one that has the ability [to **revive**
]{.mark}**the [world order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
traditionally hallmarked **[human rights]{.mark}**, [**peace**, and
**democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [with
all of its shortcomings, had [crafted]{.mark} an international agenda
that significantly impacted the [post-WWII
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Countries invested their ambitions into
security communities, international institutions, and international law
in an effort [to mitigate]{.mark} the [chances of]{.mark} a **[nuclear
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} another **[World
War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The horrors and atrocities of the two Great
Wars had traumatized the global community, which spurred calls for peace
and the creation of a universalist agenda. Today, [[the world's
**fickle**]{.mark} and **[declining hegemon]{.mark}** still [has]{.mark}
the [**ability**,]{.mark} but **[not]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}**, to
uphold the world order]{.underline} that it had so carefully and eagerly
helped construct. Now, [the stakes are too high, and there must be a
mighty and willing global leader to lead the effort of diffusing
democratic ideals and reinforcing stability through both military and
diplomatic means]{.underline}. To do this, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} [[must abandon]{.mark} its insurgent
wave of [**isolationism** and **protectionism**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and come to grips with the newly transnational nature of problems
ranging from **climate change** to **international
terrorism**]{.underline}.

First, [the]{.underline} increase in intra-state conflict should warrant
concern as many countries, namely in Africa and the Middle East, are
seeing the total collapse of civil society and government. These [power
vacuums are being filled with]{.underline} increasingly
**[ideological]{.underline}** [and dangerous tribal and non-state
actors]{.underline}, such as **[Boko Haram]{.underline}**,
**[ISIS]{.underline}**, [and **Al-Shabaab**]{.underline}. Other bloody
civil wars in Rwanda, Sudan, and the Congo have contributed to the
deaths of millions in the past two decades. As the West has seen,
however, military intervention has not been all that successful in
building and empowering democratic institutions in the Far East. A civil
crusade, along with the strengthening of international institutions, may
in fact be the answer to undoing tribal, religious, and sectarian
divisions, thereby mitigating the prospects of civil conflict. During
the Wilsonian era, missionaries did their part to internationalize the
concept of higher education, which has contributed to the growth of
universities in formerly underdeveloped countries such as China and
South Korea.\[1\] In addition, the teachings of missionaries emphasized
the universality of humanity and the oneness of man, which was
antithetical to the justifications for imperialism and the rampant
sectarianism that plagued much of the Middle East and Africa.\[2\]
Seeing that an increase in [the [magnitude of human casualty is]{.mark}
becoming [more]{.mark} of a reality [due to]{.mark} advancements in
**[military tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline} and the increasing
outbreaks of civil war, [international **[coop]{.mark}**eration
[and]{.mark} the diffusion of **[norms]{.mark}** that highlight the
importance of **stable governance**, **democracy**, and human **rights**
[is the **only recourse**]{.mark} to address the rise in sectarian
divides and civil conflicts]{.underline}. [[So long as the trend]{.mark}
of the West's desire [to **look inward** continues]{.mark}, it is likely
that nation [states]{.mark} **mired in conflict** [will]{.mark} devolve
into ethnic or tribal **enclaves** bent on [rely]{.mark}ing [on **war**
to maintain]{.mark} their legitimacy and [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Aside from growing sectarianism and the increasing prevalence of failed
states, [an even more daunting threat come from weapons that
**transcend** the costs of **conventional warfare**]{.underline}.

The problem of nuclear proliferation has been around for decades, and on
the eve of President Trump's inauguration, it appeared that
[[Obama's]{.mark} lofty [goal of advocating]{.mark} for
**[nonprolif]{.mark}eration** [would **no**]{.mark} [**longer** be **a
priority**]{.mark} of American foreign policy]{.underline}.\[3\] In
addition, now that [[the]{.mark} American [president is threatening to
undo]{.mark} much of the United States' extensive network of
**[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [formerly [non-nuclear states
may]{.mark} be forced to **[rearm]{.mark}** themselves]{.underline}.
[Disarmament is central to liberal internationalism]{.underline}, as was
apparent by the Washington Naval Treaty advocated by Wilson, and by the
modern CTBT treaty. The reverse is, however, being seen in the modern
era, [with [cries]{.mark} coming [from **Japan** and **So**]{.mark}uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea [to]{.mark} **[remobilize]{.mark}** and begin their
own **[nuclear]{.mark} weapon [programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[4\] [A
world with more nuclear actors is a formula for chaos]{.underline},
especially if nuclear weapons become mass-produced. [[**Non-state
actors** will]{.mark} increasingly [eye]{.mark} these nuclear
sites]{.underline} as was the case near a Belgian nuclear power plant
just over a year ago.\[5\] If [any government commits a serious misstep,
access to nuclear [weapons on]{.mark} the [behalf of
**terrorist**]{.mark} and **insurgent groups** [will become]{.mark} a
[reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially if a civil war occurs. States
with nuclear weapons require domestic stability and strong security,
which is why states such as **[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, [[and
**Pakistan** could be in serious trouble]{.mark} in the event of a
**domestic uprising** or military coup]{.underline}. [The
[disarmament]{.mark} of all states [is **essential for**]{.mark} **human
[survival]{.mark}**, and [if it is not achieved]{.mark}, then [a world
full of nuclear weapons]{.mark} and an international system [guided by
realpolitik could]{.mark} give [rise to **nuclear
war**]{.mark}fare.]{.underline} In today's world, nuclear weapons leave
all states virtually defenseless. But, for nuclear deproliferation to
become a cornerstone of the global agenda, a pacifying and democratic
power must rise to the limelight to advocate the virtues of peace,
stability, and human rights.

#### The plan spills over to effective democracy promotion\-\--it leverages military assistance for democratic norms in developing countries

Rachel **Stohl** **15**, adjunct professor in Security Studies Program
Georgetown University and Managing Director at the Stimson Center, and
Shannon Dick, M.A. in Security Studies from Georgetown University and
research analyst at the Stimson Center. 2/6/15, "Using Military
Assistance To Combat The Use Of Child Soldiers,"
https://reliefweb.int/report/world/using-military-assistance-combat-use-child-soldiers

A range of [[international mechanisms exist that prohibit]{.mark} the
use of [child soldiers]{.mark} in armed conflict.]{.underline} The
[United Nations' Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict requires
governments to take measures to ensure that persons under the age of 18
do not take part in hostilities and are not compulsorily recruited into
armed forces. In March 2014, the [U.N. Security Council]{.mark} adopted
[Resolution 2143]{.mark}, which]{.underline} condemns violations of
relevant international law regarding the use of children by all parties
to armed conflict. It also [calls on member states to implement
time-bound action plans to ensure that children are not used in their
armed forces or serve in hostilities. While 23 parties -- both
government and non-state armed groups alike -- have signed such action
plans, many [have **not consistently implemented**]{.mark} these
commitments]{.underline}, in part due to sustained armed violence.

While these measures represent significant steps to reduce and
ultimately end the use of children in armed conflict, [few approaches
have substantially addressed the impact that arms transfers and military
assistance have on the use of child soldiers. Though the connection
between global arms transfers and child soldiers has been
well-established, very few states have taken steps to condition the
provision of military assistance to countries that use and recruit child
soldiers.]{.underline}

Impact of Arms Transfers

[The global arms trade]{.underline} -- in its legitimate and
illegitimate forms -- [continues to fuel the recruitment of child
soldiers around the world.]{.underline} Indeed, the [dynamics of this
trade have made weapons more accessible]{.underline} to more actors,
[and despite the efforts of the international community]{.underline} to
limit the flow of weapons to parties complicit in violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law, both [**[legal and
illicit arms transfers continue to be made]{.mark}** to human rights
abusing governments and nefarious rebel groups.]{.underline} Many of
these actors forcibly recruit children to undertake menial tasks or to
serve as combatants. For years, [civil society, national governments,
and [international organizations]{.mark} have [recognize]{.mark}d the
[links]{.mark} between arms transfers and the unlawful recruitment or
use of children in armed conflict, [and called upon states to
abolish]{.mark} and criminalize [arms transfers]{.mark} to state and
non-state actors that have records of recruiting and using children in
armed conflict. Yet, few countries have actually taken steps to limit
transfers of weapons that could facilitate the use of children in armed
conflict.]{.underline} Indeed, [many countries with a proven track
record of recruiting child soldiers rely on weapons and military
assistance from some of the world's leading arms exporters.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline}, for example, [has exported millions of dollars in
small arms and light weapons to South Sudan, where child soldier
recruitment is rampant]{.underline} with more than 10,000 children
believed to be fighting in government and rebel armies. Similarly,
[Germany and France -- both among the top five weapons exporters in the
world -- have exported arms to the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), where the national army and various rebel groups are known to
forcibly recruit child soldiers.]{.underline} And [the United States,
the world's largest arms exporter, has consistently provided weapons and
military assistance to Yemen]{.underline} to be used in counterterrorism
operations, [despite widespread international condemnation for its use
of child soldiers.]{.underline}

The U.S. Response

[**T**he **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is [one of]{.mark} the
[few countries to]{.mark} have [take]{.mark}n [steps to condition the
provision of military assistance based]{.mark} upon [on]{.mark} a
[country's]{.mark} record [of child soldier use.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Through [the **C**hild **S**oldiers **P**revention **A**ct]{.underline}
(CSPA), the United States implemented national legislation to [prohibit
arms transfers and military training to countries identified by the
State Department as having recruited and used child soldiers in national
militaries or government-supported armed groups.]{.underline} In
addition, the Act incentivizes U.S. military assistance by encouraging
governments that use child soldiers to end the internationally condemned
practice.

Though the CSPA does not provide complete prohibition against all U.S.
military assistance, it does limit foreign military sales, direct
commercial sales, excess defense articles, international military
education and training, foreign military financing, and some
peacekeeping operations assistance -- which represent the largest U.S.
arms sales and military assistance programs. Under the Act, [governments
can receive otherwise prohibited assistance to professionalize their
militaries if the U.S. president certifies that the country is taking
reasonable steps to demobilize child soldiers as well as providing
rehabilitation and reintegration assistance.]{.underline} Certification
can lead to the waiving of the CPSA's restrictions and result in the
provision of military education, training, and nonlethal supplies.

[Although]{.underline} a [potentially powerful]{.underline} tool, [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has not consistently
leveraged]{.mark} the [Act's utility]{.mark} to send a strong and clear
message against the use of child soldiers. Instead, [Washington]{.mark}
has [invoked]{.mark} the [Act's waiver authority]{.mark}]{.underline}
more [[often]{.underline}]{.mark} than not [to provide full and partial
waivers to countries with known records of child soldier
use.]{.underline} For example, between 2012 and 2014, the State
Department identified the DRC, South Sudan, and Yemen as having
recruited and used children in armed conflict. However, the
administration has consistently provided waivers to the prohibitions
warranted by the CSPA that would otherwise limit U.S. military
assistance to these countries.

In some cases, [these waivers amount to millions of dollars in military
assistance. This year, Somalia might receive upwards of \$115 million in
sanctionable assistance that would otherwise be prohibited by the
CSPA.]{.underline} Yemen could have access to at least \$26 million that
would also be prohibited under the terms of the Act. These provisions of
assistance stand in contrast to conditions on the ground, where child
recruitment by government-supported armed groups in Yemen has increased
and 200 children are believed to have been recruited by the Somali
national army and allied militias in 2013 alone.

Grounds for Optimism?

[In other parts of the world, explicit action like the CSPA is even
rarer.]{.underline} Belgium, for example, has legislation that prohibits
the export and transit of arms to countries that use child soldiers in
their national armies. However, [most states have yet to develop
regulations that respond to the established connection between arms
transfers and the use of child soldiers.]{.underline} The new Arms Trade
Treaty might be one vehicle that governments can use to fill that void.
Because children are at risk of being recruited and used by government
forces, paramilitaries, and other armed groups, efforts to condition
arms transfers must be broader in scope.

Globally, [[measures like]{.mark} the [CSPA could be used to]{.mark}
mitigate and ultimately **[end the use of child soldiers]{.mark}** in
national militaries and government-supported armed groups.]{.underline}
It, along with similar measures, should be considered within a larger,
coordinated context to support sustainable institutions and security
apparatuses in emerging democracies. [The [implementation of arms
and]{.mark} assistance **[prohibitions]{.mark}** [should complement
**democracy promotion** and security]{.mark} sector
[reform]{.mark}]{.underline}. Prohibitions can and should be linked to
the signing and implementation of national action plans focused on
demobilizing and ending recruitment of child soldiers. In short, [[these
measures]{.mark} can be used to [encourage changes in government
behavior]{.mark} and [to **promote democratic norms**]{.mark} within the
military structure that do not rely on the use of child
soldiers.]{.underline}

#### Liberal democracy solves global nuclear war

Claire **Berlinski 18**, Ph.D. international relations from Oxford
University, 7/15/18, "Europe's Dependence on the U.S. Was All Part of
the Plan,"
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/15/trump-nato-europe-history-dependence-219011

What Trump fails to understand is that the [disparity in spending, with
[the U.S.]{.mark} paying more than its allies, is **not a bug** of the
system. It is a **feature**]{.underline}. [This is how the great
[postwar]{.mark} statesmen designed it, and this immensely foresighted
[strategy]{.mark} has **[ensured]{.mark} the [absence of great power
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[and]{.underline} **[nuclear
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}---for three-quarters of a century.

[The]{.underline} open, [liberal world order we know today was
built]{.underline} in the wake of World War II and expanded after the
collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it is led [by the **U**nited
**S**tates; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military hegemony over
Eurasia]{.underline} while uniting Europe under the U.S.' protection.
[[The goal]{.mark} of this American grand strategy is to **[prevent any
single power from dominating]{.mark} the region**]{.underline} [and
turning on the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies. [American hegemony
serves]{.mark}, too, [to quell]{.mark} previously intractable **regional
[rivalries]{.mark}**[, preventing]{.mark} further **[world
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Dean Acheson, George Marshall and the other
great statesmen of their generation pursued this strategy because they
had learned, at unimaginable cost, that the eternal American fantasy of
forever being free of Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in
other words---was just that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American
men lost their lives in the European theaters of the First and Second
World Wars. (American fatalities in all of the other 20th-century
conflicts---including Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total
one-quarter of that number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor
incompetent. They were the architects of the greatest foreign policy
triumph in U.S. history.

[So successful was this policy that Americans now]{.underline}---most of
whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of these wars---[see
**peace**, **unity**, **prosperity** and **stability** as Europe's
natural state. This is an illusion]{.underline}. [For centuries, Europe
was the **fulcrum of global violence**]{.underline}. With the age of
global exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of violence,
the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with
improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the
division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in
point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the
representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to
Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for
several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their
exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King Léopold
II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten
million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations.

In recognizing this history of blood, however, [we must recognize
something equally true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy
saw its fullest realization in the West. This flourishing of
**peace**]{.underline} [and **human rights**]{.underline} [cannot be
explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism]{.underline}.
(Consider the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President
Dwight Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) [It happened
because]{.underline} during World War II, [Europe destroyed itself,
leaving the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} [overwhelmingly powerful
by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Through the
application of economic, diplomatic and military force majeure, the
United States suppressed Europe's internal security competition. This is
why postwar Europe ceased to be the world's leading exporter of violence
and became, instead, the world's leading exporter of luxury sedans.

Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised it, could have
pacified and unified Europe under its aegis. No other continental
country possessed half the world's GDP. No other country had enough
distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large extent, by all parties
and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No other country had a
strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that its inhabitants
could be persuaded gladly to share.

Indeed, Europeans cooperated with the U.S. program because it created
conditions under which both the United States and Europe flourished. The
United States assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13
billion of aid in the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars,
roughly \$113 billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that
would become the European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S.
security umbrella with the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its
most important element, declares that an attack on one member of NATO is
an attack on all members. These policies were intended not only to
counter the Soviet Union, but to condition Europe's prosperity upon its
integration into a single market, with free movement of goods, capital
and labor. The founders of these institutions fully intended them to be
the foundations of a United States of Europe, much like the United
States of America. Profound economic interdependence, they believed,
would make further European wars impossible.

At the same time, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [built an
open]{.mark}, global [order]{.mark} upon an architecture of specific
institutions: [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[N]{.mark}**ations, the
**[I]{.mark}**nternational **[M]{.mark}**onetary **[F]{.mark}**und
[and]{.mark} the **[I]{.mark}**nternational **[C]{.mark}**ourt of
**[J]{.mark}**ustice]{.underline}. This order is in many respects an
empire---[a [Pax Americana]{.mark}]{.underline}---but it [[is more
humane than any empire that preceded]{.mark} it, with institutions that
are intended to **benefit all parties**]{.underline}. Postwar U.S.
statesmen believed that prosperous, liberal democracies that traded
freely with each other would neither go to war with each other nor the
United States. [They [ascribed]{.mark},]{.underline} in other words,
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the so-called [**[D]{.mark}**emocratic
**[P]{.mark}**eace **[t]{.mark}**heory]{.underline}---[[a theory with
**overwhelming empirical support**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The U.S. military was always an integral part of the plan to unite and
rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II, U.S. troops have
been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot be dominated by
a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and turning them
against the U.S. [The **U**nited **S**tates has built overwhelmingly
massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they
begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection
that there is no need to begin local arms races]{.underline}, for their
safety is guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility
of its promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in
turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin
Airlift, when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet
blockade, was precisely such a display.) In return for the United
States' commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America's dominant role in
the international system.

In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought
to undermine the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because the
Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West under the United
States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda organs cranked into
overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example, published in Isvestia
in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a
fat capitalist bent on destroying the sovereignty of European nations.
The French paper L\'Humanité, which reliably parroted Moscow's line,
wrote, "After disorganizing the national economies of the countries
which are under the American yoke, American leaders now intend
conclusively to subjugate the economy of these countries to their own
interests."

The Soviet Union's criticism of the Marshall Plan and other American
involvement in Europe was eerily similar to the language Russia's now
uses in its campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and
tropes of Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly or
unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and other antiliberal politicians,
parties and movements throughout the West. With the men who built the
postwar world order now in their graves, and the memory of carnage and
horror buried with them, a very sizable constituency of Americans has
forgotten that their country built this system for a reason---that the
United States does not maintain its alliances as an act of foolish
largesse. The loudest exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting
rolled, that the European Union was "created to destroy us," and that
multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization assault
the "sovereignty" of the nations concerned is, unfortunately, the
president of the United States.

It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are.
[History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is
never so cooperative. Global free **trade sustains modern economic
life**]{.underline}. An interruption to this trade---carried out chiefly
on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S. military---would bring
modern life to an end. [[The Second World War proved]{.mark} not only
that [isolationism]{.mark} and [American-Firstism were
fantasies]{.mark}, but exceptionally childish and **dangerous
ones**]{.underline}, at that. [[In the age]{.mark} of hyperglobalized
[trade]{.mark}, international air travel, [the
internet,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [and
**i**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nter**[c]{.mark}**ontinental
**[b]{.mark}**allistic **[m]{.mark}**issile**[s]{.mark}**,
[these]{.mark} fantasies [are]{.mark}]{.underline} even more childish
and [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. may be on another
continent, but it is not on another planet.

It is true that the U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was
always part of the deal. [The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight
a war anywhere in the world, invade any country]{.underline} at will,
[and]{.underline} (at least in theory) [fight multiple simultaneous
major wars]{.underline}---[even in space]{.underline}. Of course this
costs more. [It is in America's advantage to be the only power on the
planet that can do this]{.underline}.

Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage for other
countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do. Europe is
America's biggest export market, as designed. We want Europeans to spend
their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not razing Flanders to the
ground yet again.

Yet Trump's refusal to deter our shared enemies and protect our allies
risks provoking a regional European arms race---exactly what the U.S.
has sought to avoid for 74 years. It is an invitation to adventurism
from Putin. Trump's refusal to adopt the encouraging language of past
presidents toward European integration, language that until now has been
transformed into policy by professional and experienced State Department
employees, puts further strain on an already-weakened Europe. Above all,
Trump's overt support for sordid, Kremlin-backed actors who seek to
undermine Europe's unity is unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's
interest, or in ours, for the American president to lend the United
States' prestige and support to Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal
Marxists, populists, authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists,
particularly since all of them are ideologically hostile to the United
States?

The damage Trump has deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability comes
at a uniquely dangerous time. [Democracy's so-called third
wave]{.underline}---the global blossoming of open political systems
after the Cold War---[has long since receded. A threat to liberal
democracy, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology]{.underline}---**[[illiberal
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[is ascendant]{.underline}]{.mark}.
We see it today in Russia and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic,
kleptocratic and hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates
itself through the new technologies of the 21st century.

[The global order the U.S. built was based on the principle that
[only]{.mark} a world of **[liberal democracies can be peaceful]{.mark}
and prosperous**. That principle is **correct**]{.underline}.
[[Should]{.mark} the [unraveling of the]{.mark} order the [U.S.]{.mark}
built [proceed]{.mark} at this pace, **[the world will]{.mark} soon [be
neither peaceful nor prosperous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Nor]{.mark}
will [the effects]{.mark} be [confined]{.mark} to regions distant from
the United States. [America will feel them]{.mark} gradually, and
then]{.underline}, probably, **[[overnight]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[in
the form of a **devastating, sudden shock**]{.underline}.

Charles de Gaulle believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long
term, be trusted with French security. It led him to withdraw France
from NATO's military integrated command and launch an independent
nuclear development program. The independent nuclear program was real,
but the withdrawal from NATO wasn't---a secret agreement kept France in
NATO anyway. But, today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the
costs and benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the
risks and rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de
Gaulle is saying from the grave, I told you so.

[The American-led world order, undergirded by the ideal of [liberal
democracy, has been]{.mark} highly **[imperfect]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [it has been the closest thing to Utopia our
fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits
are]{.underline} not just economic, although those benefits are
**[immense]{.underline}**. [Its [benefits must be **measured in wars not
fought**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [lives not squandered.]{.underline}

#### The affirmative recognizes child soldiers as a security concern which establishes a model for navigating the human rights, military conflicts 

Rachel **Stohl 18**, managing director and directs the Conventional
Defense program at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, 2-12-2018, \"Child
Soldiers Pose a National Security Threat\", National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/child-soldiers-pose-national-security-threat-24470

[Tens of thousands of children continue to be used in conflicts around
the world]{.underline}, with many used as child soldiers or in
combat-support roles. Indeed, a brief snapshot of the numbers tells a
grim story. [In South Sudan]{.underline}, the United Nations estimates
that [more than nineteen thousand children have been used as child
soldiers in the country's civil war since 2013]{.underline}. More than
two thousand children have been recruited by Boko Haram [in Nigeria in
2016 alone and they have been increasingly used as "human
bombs]{.underline}." [In Yemen]{.underline}, the UN has documented [more
than 1,700 children]{.underline} who [have been recruited]{.underline}
since March 2015 [to fight in the]{.underline} ongoing [civil
war]{.underline}.

For years, [this issue has prompted numerous calls for pragmatic
approaches to mitigate and ultimately prevent the future use of child
soldiers]{.underline}. Yet many efforts, particularly those aimed at
modifying national policies and implementing legislation, are stymied at
the start because [the]{.underline} recruitment and [use of child
soldiers is viewed narrowly as a human-rights concern, rather
than]{.underline} an issue that holds both [human security and
national-security implications.]{.underline} These two things are not
mutually exclusive.

With sustained conflicts and the continued use of children to wage wars,
it is time to reframe the discussion on child soldiers and better
emphasize the security challenges presented by the exploitation of
children in conflict---both for the conflicts' duration and the
long-term impacts of those that come into contact with child soldiers.

The recruitment and use of child soldiers are not crimes of desperation
or opportunity, but represent a deliberate strategic process to sustain
conflict. [[Child soldiers are]{.mark} often [seen as expendable]{.mark}
and replenishable]{.underline}, and do not require significant training
or investment. And although [children in conflict]{.underline} are
unlikely to change the tempo of warfare or provide significant strategic
advantage to one side or another, they [can sustain conflict and fulfill
much-needed positions such as porters, spies, cooks and
combatants]{.underline}---thus extending the length and lethality of
conflicts and sustaining conditions that perpetuate the conflict's
continuation. It is therefore important to frame policy discussions to
attend to the perceived strategic incentives (and disincentives) of
using children in conflict, and identify effective ways to ultimately
end the recruitment and use of child soldiers.

To combat the reliance on children as tools of warfare, governments can
train military leaders on the risks and inefficiencies of relying on
children to fight their wars. The Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative,
run by former Canadian Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, who served as the force
commander for the UN Mission in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, has
taken such an approach to eradicate the use of child soldiers. The
initiative works with governments to implement trainings that educate
military leaders on the dangers and pitfalls of using child soldiers, as
well as inform them of the international legal frameworks that protect
children from exploitation in armed conflict. The initiative also aims
to adapt military doctrine to better help national armed forces prepare
for the possibility of confronting children in combat. In March 2017,
Canada became the first country to adopt such a doctrine.

Governments can also leverage military assistance to dissuade foreign
militaries from recruiting and using children in combat. To date, very
few countries have linked these issues and implemented national
legislation that conditions arms sales and military assistance on a
country's record of using or supporting the use of child soldiers. Such
initiatives have been undertaken by Belgium, Switzerland and the United
States to augment broader efforts to get children off the battlefield.
Although the conversation on child soldiers often falls off
national-security agendas---or to a lower-tier priority---there are
numerous opportunities to enhance efforts to prevent and ultimately end
the recruitment and use of children in combat.

[In the United States, one such effort is [the Child Soldiers Prevention
Act (CSPA),]{.mark} which [seeks to]{.mark} encourage countries to
[stop]{.mark} recruiting and [using child soldiers]{.mark} by
[leveraging]{.mark} U.S. [security assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Under the CSPA, countries identified by the State Department as using
or supporting the use of child soldiers **are prohibited from receiving
U.S. weapons and certain types of military assistance**, unless they
receive a waiver from the president. **[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has invoked]{.mark} such [national-interest
waivers]{.mark} more often than not**]{.underline}, however, and allowed
nearly \$1.7 billion in military assistance to flow to thirteen
countries known to use/support the use of child soldiers since the CSPA
was enacted---thereby effectively giving a pass to governments that
routinely exploit children in their national militaries or
government-supported armed groups.

[[What is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only [[broader]{.mark} application and [implementation of the
CSPA]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also potential reframing of the broader
issues surrounding the recruitment and use of child soldiers so as to
better prepare U.S. military personnel for situations in which they may
encounter children in combat roles. This includes awareness raising in
advance of operations that may encounter child soldiers, as well as
post-deployment counseling to deal with the aftermath of engagement with
children in conflict.

The United States could also adopt bureaucratic changes to address the
use of child soldiers. While the United States is not Canada, and it
plays a different role in military operations around the world, an
adapted Canada doctrine may be appropriate for the U.S. military.
Regardless, the United States needs to expand the range of stakeholders
engaged in these discussions and incorporate the issue into engagement
and operation planning to deal with the situation of encountering child
soldiers on the ground and better address the psychological aftermath of
military engagement with young children.

Further, the United States can work with other countries, particularly
those that are military-assistance donors, to establish additional
protections for children in conflict. This can mean working with
governments to implement their own legislation to condition their
military relationships on stopping the use of child soldiers. Such an
approach can also include awareness of---and support for---groups and
organizations working on child soldier reintegration and prevention so
that the most vulnerable children are protected from re-recruitment.

[[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and other governments must
recognize that the issue of child soldiers is a **security
concern**]{.mark}---[not just a moral and ethical dilemma. Changing the
way that governments]{.mark} and militaries [talk about]{.mark} the
issue of [child soldiers will allow a wider variety of actors to engage
in]{.mark} more [**creative** and **effective solutions** that]{.mark}
could put a [stop]{.mark} to [this]{.mark} horrific [practice while
protecting national-security interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Linkage of human rights promotion in security policy solves global war

William W. **Burke-White 04**, Lecturer in Public and International
Affairs and Senior Special Assistant to the Dean, Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Spring 2004,
Harvard Human Rights Journal, 17 Harv. Hum. Rts. J. 249, p. 279-280

This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed to ideological or
normative\--argument that the [[promotion of **human rights** should
be]{.mark} given a more [prominent]{.mark} place [in U.S. foreign
policy]{.mark}. It does so by suggesting a correlation between the
domestic human rights practices of states and their propensity to engage
in **aggressive international conduct**]{.underline}. Among the chief
threats to U.S. national security are acts of aggression by other
states. Aggressive acts of war may directly endanger the United States,
as did the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, or they may require
U.S. military action overseas, as in Kuwait fifty years later. Evidence
from the post-Cold War period \[\*250\] indicates that [[states
that]{.mark} **systematically [abuse]{.mark}** their own
[citizens\']{.mark} human rights [are]{.mark} also those [most likely to
engage in **aggression**]{.mark}. To the degree that
[improvements]{.mark} in various states\' human rights records
**[decrease the likelihood of aggressive war]{.mark}**, a foreign
[policy informed by human rights can]{.mark} significantly [enhance U.S.
and global security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since 1990, [a state\'s domestic human rights policy appears to be a
telling indicator of that state\'s **propensity to engage in
international aggression**]{.underline}. [A central element of U.S.
foreign policy has long been the **preservation of peace**]{.underline}
[and the **prevention** of such acts of **aggression**]{.underline}. n2
If [[the correlation]{.mark} discussed herein]{.underline} is accurate,
it [[provides]{.mark} U.S. policymakers with [a]{.mark} powerful new
[tool to **enhance**]{.mark} **national [security through]{.mark} the
[promotion of human rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A [[strategic
linkage]{.mark} [between]{.mark} national [security and human rights
would result in]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of important policy
modifications. [First]{.underline}, it changes [the [prioritization
of]{.mark} those [countries]{.mark} U.S. policymakers have identified as
[presenting the greatest concern]{.mark}. Second]{.underline}, it alters
some of the [policy prescriptions for such states]{.underline}.
[Third,]{.underline} [[it offers states a means of **signaling**
benign]{.mark} international [intent through]{.mark} the [improvement
of]{.mark} their domestic [human rights]{.mark} records]{.underline}.
Fourth, [[it provides a way for a current government to **prevent future
governments from aggressive**]{.mark} **international
[behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[through]{.mark} the
[**institutionalization** of **human rights
protections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fifth, [[it addresses the]{.mark}
particular [threat of human rights abusing states obtaining]{.mark}
weapons of mass destruction [(WMD)]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, it
offers a mechanism for U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

[Arms transfers have a well-documented and multi-faceted impact on human
rights]{.underline}. They facilitate the movement of the very same
weapons -- or ammunition -- that are used to curtail human rights in
direct and specific ways by militaries, paramilitaries, law enforcement
groups, criminals and gangs. This impact includes, but is not limited to
the recruitment of children and their use in hostilities.

[Experts]{.underline} have long [recognized the **[strong link between
child soldiers and arms transfers]{.mark},** particularly small arms and
light weapons]{.underline}. In 2008, the Special Representative of the
Secretary General (SRSG) on Children and Armed Conflict, stated that "it
is argued by many that it is **[the [prolif]{.mark}eration [of small
arms]{.mark} that has actually [contributed to this rise]{.mark}
\[[of]{.mark} the phenomenon of [child soldiers]{.mark}\]]{.underline}**
-- the ready availability of small arms in the period 1970 -- 2000 led
to the rise and the phenomenon of child soldiers as we know it
today."\[1\] A clear message from the SRSG continues to be that ["**[any
strategy to counter]{.mark} the [recruitment of children must]{.mark}
therefore contain initiatives to [better control arms]{.mark} that fuel
conflicts."\[**]{.underline}2\] As Child Soldiers International has
argued, beyond situations of active armed conflicts, [children are
unlawfully recruited or at risk of such recruitment in other countries
and invariably these practices put them at risk of use in hostilities,
should an armed conflict erupt]{.underline}.\[3\] **[Arms transfers
facilitate violence that enables the conditions for recruitment of child
soldiers.]{.underline}** Child recruitment is often accompanied by the
use, or under the threat of, armed violence. The Committee on the Rights
of the Child has regularly addressed the connection between child
soldiers and arms trade in its concluding observations.\[4\] For
example, in 2013, the [Committee urged the USA]{.underline} "**[to
[enact]{.mark} and apply full [prohibition of arms
exports]{.mark},]{.underline}** [including small arms and light weapons
as well as any kind of military assistance [to countries where children
are]{.mark} known to be, or may potentially be, recruited or [used
in]{.mark} armed [conflict]{.mark} and/or hostilities.]{.underline} To
this end, the State party is encouraged to review [and]{.underline}
amend the 2008 Child Soldiers Prevention Act with a **[view to
[withdrawing the]{.mark} possibility of allowing for [presidential
waivers to these countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"\[5\]

In 2016, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute [(SIPRI)
reported that]{.underline} "with a 33 per cent share of total arms
exports, the [USA was the top arms exporter]{.underline} in 2012--16,
compared with 30 per cent in 2007--11. [Its exports of major weapons
increased by 21 per cent compared with 2007--11.]{.underline} At the
regional level, the Middle East was the largest recipient of USA
weapons, accounting for 47 per cent of US arms exports. "\[6\] In 2013,
the Small Arms Survey reported the USA as the world's biggest exporter
of small arms and light weapons.\[7\] [Since 2013, the USA has exported
arms to]{.underline} countries such as [Colombia, [Afghanistan,
Iraq]{.mark}, Pakistan and Nigeria]{.underline},\[8\] [which are [among
those on the]{.mark} UN Secretary-General's [list showing which state
armed forces and non-state armed groups recruit and use
children]{.mark}]{.underline} (known as "the list of shame"). In this
submission, we will provide Afghanistan and Iraq as country examples.

[Between 2013 and 2016, the USA has exported arms worth of]{.underline}
\$379 million (Trend Indicator Values, TIV) to Afghanistan\[9\] and
worth [\$2,225 million (TIV) to Iraq.]{.underline}\[10\] In 2016, Action
on Armed Violence (AOAV) published an analysis covering the period
between September 2001 and September 2015 showing, among other things,
that [the US Department of Defense ([DoD]{.mark}]{.underline}) "actually
[[spent]{.mark}]{.underline} a possible total of \$2,158,253,826 [[on
small arms]{.mark} including ammunition and attachments [to Iraq and
Afghanistan -- over \$2 billion]{.mark} and almost eight times than
publicly stated]{.underline} by the DoD [(\$1,176,671,415 for
Iraq]{.underline}; \$981,582,411 for Afghanistan)" during that
period.\[11\] AOAV further highlighted "the lack of accountability,
transparency and joined up data that exists at the very heart of the US
government's weapon procurement and distribution systems."\[12\]

In 2016, the UN Secretary-General reported that in Afghanistan the
number of verified cases of recruitment and use of children more than
doubled compared with 2014. The verified recruitment cases were
attributed to the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and the
majority to the Taliban and other armed groups. The Secretary-General
also reported "continuing concern about allegations of cross-border
recruitment of children and of use of religious schools in Afghanistan
and Pakistan for child recruitment and military training by the Taliban
and other armed groups".\[13\] Child Soldiers International\[14\] and
Human Rights Watch\[15\] are among the NGOs that have reported child
recruitment in Afghanistan.

In late 2016, Human Rights Watch documented 29 cases in which two armed
groups, affiliated with the Partiya Karkerên Kurdistanê [([PKK) had
recruited children]{.mark} in Sinjar and in the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq]{.underline}.\[16\] Previously, Human Rights Watch indicated that
[[militias within]{.mark} the Popular Mobilization Forces [(PMF)]{.mark}
also [use children in their fight against
ISIS.\[]{.mark}]{.underline}17\] [The UN Secretary-General has also
reported verified cases of recruitment and use of children in
hostilities]{.underline}, with cases attributed to ISIS, the Kurdish
Workers Party and other Kurdish armed groups, and to groups under the
umbrella of the popular mobilization forces.\[18\]

As noted earlier, [**[arms transfers facilitate violence that enables
the conditions for recruitment of child soldiers]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
The fact that recruitment and use of children in hostilities is a
recognized problem in a country should be a cause for concern in making
arms export decisions, per any human rights assessment. Such assessment
should not be limited to determining whether arms transfers from the USA
are a direct factor in making it easier to recruit children or whether
are used by child soldiers.

The Committee should reiterate its recommendations to [the
USA]{.underline} with regard to arms transfers, in particular the
recommendation to [enact and apply full prohibition of arms exports,
including small arms and light weapons,]{.underline} as well as any kind
of military assistance to countries where children are known to be, or
may potentially be, recruited or used in armed conflict and/or
hostilities.

#### Presidential waivers allow arms transfers to countries that use child soldiers\-\--getting rid of waivers is key to making US leverage effective

Rachel **Stohl**, 10-24-20**18**, managing director at the Stimson
Center, Shannon Dick, research associate with the Conventional Defense
Program, The Trump Administration is Failing to Stop the Use of Child
Soldiers, National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-administration-failing-stop-use-child-soldiers-34242

In what is becoming a yearly disappointment, [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration again [missed a **key opportunity** to]{.mark} encourage
foreign governments to [stop]{.mark} recruiting and using [child
soldiers]{.mark}. Late last month when President Donald [Trump]{.mark}
released his determinations with respect to the Child Soldiers
Prevention Act (CSPA) of 2008, he [declared]{.mark} that it [is in the
national interest]{.mark} of the United States [to provide]{.mark} U.S.
[military assistance to seven countries known to]{.mark}
recruit/[use]{.mark}---or support the recruitment/use of---[children in
armed conflict]{.mark}. In so doing, the Trump administration chose to
overlook notable human-rights concerns and undermine U.S. efforts to
prevent the use of child soldiers.]{.underline}

Ten years ago, [Congress passed **[the CSPA]{.mark}** with the
**[goal]{.mark}** of **[leveraging U.S. arms transfers]{.mark}** and
military assistance **[to dissuade foreign governments from]{.mark}
recruiting and [using children in]{.mark} their national
[militaries]{.mark}** or government-sponsored armed groups]{.underline}.
The CSPA requires the secretary of state to identify countries that
recruit and use child soldiers. [Once [listed]{.mark}, those
[governments are prohibited from receiving]{.mark} seven specific
categories of U.S. military assistance]{.underline} provided by the
Departments of State and Defense. [These programs]{.underline} are often
the most coveted by foreign governments and [include:
**[d]{.mark}**irect **[c]{.mark}**ommercial **[s]{.mark}**ales, excess
defense articles, foreign military financing, **[f]{.mark}**oreign
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[s]{.mark}**ales, international military and
education training assistance (IMET), peacekeeping operations assistance
(PKO) and Section 1206 assistance]{.underline}.

[In June 2018, the State Department identified eleven countries as
violators under the CSPA: Burma (Myanmar), the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), Iran, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan,
Syria and Yemen. While under the law these countries are technically
prohibited from receiving U.S. military assistance in fiscal year (FY)
2019, **[the president can waive]{.mark} the CSPA's
[prohibitions]{.mark} and allow these identified governments to remain
eligible to receive U.S. weapons and military assistance.**]{.underline}

Do You Know What Happened Today In History?

The 2018 list is the second opportunity the Trump administration has had
to demonstrate its commitment to stopping the use of child soldiers. [In
2017, the list omitted notorious violators Afghanistan, Iraq and Myanmar
and was seen as a political statement demonstrating the lack of
importance the Trump administration placed on stopping this horrific
practice. Although the 2018 list was more comprehensive in scope, **the
[Trump]{.mark} administration['s]{.mark} application of the
[waivers]{.mark} has [made a mockery of the CSPA
list.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In its release of the presidential waivers last week, the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [announced]{.mark} that it was
[waiving]{.mark} CSPA [prohibitions for]{.mark} seven of the eleven
governments identified on the State Department's child soldiers list,
thereby allowing all the military assistance requested by the U.S.
government to [**Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and
Yemen** to proceed, despite]{.mark} their records of using or supporting
[the use of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yemen, however, is
currently not slated to receive any CSPA-relevant military assistance in
FY 19.

Only seven of the eleven countries identified on this year's CSPA list
are slated to receive U.S. military assistance in fiscal year 2019: the
DRC, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan. Therefore,
with the Trump administration's recent determination, six of these seven
countries will not be affected by the CSPA's prohibitions. Iraq will
remain eligible to receive \$1 million in IMET, Mali and Niger will both
remain eligible to receive \$700,000 in IMET, Nigeria remains eligible
to receive \$800,000 in IMET, Somalia remains eligible to receive
\$225,000 in IMET and \$95 million in PKO assistance, and South Sudan
remains eligible to receive over \$24 million in PKO assistance. [No
waivers were provided for Burma, the DRC, Iran or Syria. However, no
assistance has thus far been requested under the CSPA programs for
Burma, Iran or Syria, meaning the CSPA will have no real impact on those
countries]{.underline}. All told, [**the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[waived]{.mark} more than [97 percent of]{.mark} otherwise prohibited
[assistance]{.mark}** [to countries with]{.mark} known [child soldier
abuses]{.mark}, allowing \$123 million in U.S. military assistance to
continue to flow to these governments.]{.underline}

[The only government facing any consequences from its continued use and
recruitment of child soldiers is the DRC. The DRC had been slated to
receive funds through IMET and PKO, but it is now ineligible to receive
this assistance because it did not receive a waiver from the Trump
administration]{.underline}. That means that DRC will miss out on
\$375,000 in IMET and more than \$2 million in PKO assistance due to
their continued use of child soldiers.

One government out of eleven. Or, put another way, [an implementation
rate of less than 10 percent [for a law]{.mark} that the U.S. government
has traditionally [held up as a **key instrument** for combating human
trafficking]{.mark} in the form of child soldiers. Governments choosing
to abuse their most vulnerable populations can continue to do so without
being held accountable. The [Trump]{.mark} administration continues to
[send the **wrong message** and fails to emphasize]{.mark} that
[abuse]{.mark} of children [will not be tolerated]{.mark}. Instead, the
Trump administration is actively ignoring the plight of affected
children around the world and [demonstrating that]{.mark} its
**[assurances to protect children ring hollow]{.mark}**. The CSPA's
drafters intended the waivers to be used judiciously to address
national-security needs. However, the Trump administration is instead
using the waivers to continue arming perpetual violators of the
law]{.underline}. Children exploited by parties to armed conflict
deserve better.

#### Scenario \[x\]: Iraq

#### The use of child soldiers in Iraq by Popular Mobilization Forces increases sectarian conflict and instability\-\--the US needs to pressure Baghdad to increase accountability

Belkis **Willie 17**- senior Iraq researcher in the Middle East and
North Africa division at HRW; investigates human rights abuses in Iraq.
1/6/2017 "Integrating Iraqi Fighting Forces Is Not Enough", Human Rights
Watch,
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/06/integrating-iraqi-fighting-forces-not-enough>

Human Rights Watch saw [Shia armed forces allied with the Iraqi
government commit horrific abuses against the Sunni civilian
population]{.underline} during the operation to retake Fallujah back in
May. We didn't want it to happen again in Mosul.

As a result, Human Rights Watch pressed the Iraqi government to keep
[the abusive units within the Popular Mobilization Forces,]{.underline}
also known as Hashd al-Sha'abi, out of the Mosul operation. Diplomats I
spoke with at the time said that letting these militia participate could
be the biggest risk to the Sunni Arab civilians of Mosul as they fled
the fighting against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS).

In an attempt to curb the abuses while still relying on the fighting
forces, [[the Iraqi government]{.mark}, with strong U.S. support, took
steps to [bring]{.mark} the [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization
[F]{.mark}orces [under]{.mark} Iraqi [central command]{.mark}. They also
started integrating Sunni units into the Popular Mobilization
Forces.]{.underline}

[The [authorities miscalculated]{.mark}, however]{.underline}. It turned
out that [[integrating]{.mark} Sunni units into the Popular Mobilization
Forces, so that fighters would represent the same sectarian background
as the civilians inside Mosul, [was not]{.mark} in and of itself [a
safeguard against abuse]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[We]{.mark} have [documented]{.mark} several incidents of
[abuse]{.mark} by Sunni [forces within the P]{.mark}opular
[M]{.mark}obilization [F]{.mark}orces]{.underline} since the fight
against ISIS in Mosul began[, **[including]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[unlawful detention, ill-treatment and torture of civilians,
executions, and [the use of child soldiers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In late October, the Hashad al-Asha'ri Fares al-Sabawy militia detained
and beat at least 22 men from two villages near Mosul. We have found
that [[the unit]{.mark},]{.underline} and another called the Hashad
al-Asha'ri Farsan al-Jubour, **[[had been recruiting child soldiers from
a camp for]{.mark} internally [displaced people]{.mark} since the
spring]{.underline}**. In late November, [Farsan al-Jubour, a militia
made up of Sunni fighters, also summarily executed at least four men
they suspected of affiliation with ISIS, without any judicial
proceeding.]{.underline}

[We even documented]{.underline} one incident of [a Shabak unit within
the Popular Mobilization Forces unlawfully detaining at least 150
families overnight.]{.underline}

We know that **[[the U.S.]{.mark} government [is training some
of]{.mark} the Shia and Sunni [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization
[F]{.mark}orces,]{.underline}** though we don't know if the groups we
found to have committed these abuses benefited from this training.

The lesson from the last months of fighting in Iraq is clear: **[[Simply
including Sunni fighters in militias is no guarantee that they will
suddenly perform like well-trained military]{.underline}]{.mark}** units
with clear command and control structures, accountability processes for
abuses, [**[with the interests of the Iraqi people at
heart.]{.underline}** [Absent accountability]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
abuses committed by these armed forces, [we can expect these abuses to
continue]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Similarly, [just integrating groups into the official Iraqi state forces
is not a cure-all for abusive groups]{.underline}.

In February, [Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi issued Order 91, officially
[incorporating the]{.mark} [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization Forces
[as an "independent military formation]{.mark}" within Iraq's security
forces]{.underline}. On November 26, Iraq's parliament passed a law
formalizing the decision. Military analysts in Washington and Baghdad
are split on whether this integration will prove beneficial to Iraq.
They first believed that this step represents an important way for Abadi
to bring some order to Iraq's security structures by establishing limits
to their powers. [Others think that this [will **increase
sectarianism**]{.mark} in the armed forces, [or]{.mark} worse still,
will [allow the P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization [F]{.mark}orces to
**[carry out abuses in the name of the Iraqi
government]{.mark}**]{.underline} with increased power and impunity.

If the past is any guide, however, what is clear is that if [Abadi's
[government is unwilling to investigate allegations of abuse]{.mark} by
Popular Mobilization Forces or other forces including the Iraqi Security
Forces and hold the abusers responsible]{.underline}, any plans of
bringing Shia, Sunni and other minority forces in line may fail
miserably. So far we have not seen the results of a single government
investigation.

Meanwhile, senior U.S. military commanders --- like Brig. Gen. Rick
Uribe and Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend --- say they are so far impressed
with the behavior of the Iraqi forces.

But [if [the U.S. government]{.mark}]{.underline} wants to continue to
support the Iraqi military and to train these groups, it
[[should]{.underline} [be **leaning hard on Baghdad** to
investigate]{.underline}]{.mark} the growing list of [[abuse]{.mark}
allegations and to bring to justice those it finds
responsible]{.underline} for any wrongdoing.

#### Iraq instability spills over to Middle East war

Baha **Erbas 15**, fellow at the Turkish Heritage Organization, \"THE
UNITY OF IRAQ: A NEXUS OF STABILITY\",
https://www.turkheritage.org/en/publications/analysis/the-unity-of-iraq-a-nexus-of-stability-4808

[[Iraq]{.mark} is the Middle East in miniature. **It [holds all]{.mark}
the [religious and ethnic diversity of the]{.mark} entire
[region]{.mark}** from the Mediterranean to the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}; from Anatolia to the Indian Ocean. [To look at
[the]{.mark} grand [Middle East]{.mark} picture realistically, the
social scientist or diplomat [must recognize Iraq as **the
region's**]{.mark} **essence and [heart]{.mark}**; the social fabric and
the harmoniousness of the Middle East is alive in all parties in Iraq.
Sunnis, Shias, Yezidis, Arabs, Persians, Kurds, Turks---with thousands
of years of history. **[Being the cradle of]{.mark} all these [ancient
civilizations makes Iraq the one indispensable]{.mark} social and
political [actor]{.mark} throughout the region. Iraq is [the bedrock of
the Middle East]{.mark}, for providing stability in the region. [The
stability of the entire region has a deep]{.mark} balance and
[connection with the future of Iraq]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[The Shia of Iraq have a profound effect, acting as a buffer between
Iran and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States and the Sunnis. The Kurds
being the buffer zone between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria; Sunnis being
the heart of the traditional monarchies and the state until Saddam's
fall, and occupying a special place between Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey
and Iran. All these groups have a potential stake and risk in any social
or political developments in all these countries. Conversely, the
instability in Iraq deeply affects the stability of all these countries.
Therefore, **[the crux of the stability in the region depends on the
future of Iraq]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Due to this socially vital composition of Iraq, any political decision
made without taking into consideration the balance and equilibrium of
all these macro-regional factors would bring the entire region into
greater instability and calamity.]{.underline}

Throughout history, [no great power was able to dominate the region
without having a strong hand in Iraq.]{.underline} The Ottoman Empire,
due to Iraq's unique geopolitical and social position, had wielded a
strong hand in the days when it controlled Bagdad.

The invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the vacuum that created, has had
direct consequences for the entire region through ISIS, DAESH, PYD, and
YPG. The situation in Syria isn't readily understood without looking at
Iraq's last decade of instability. Today, the Syrian Civil War
represents the most bitter story of the post-Cold War era. A third of
the country's population has fled the country, almost a million people
are lost or dead, and no one knows that when the calamity will end. As
we have observed, [[Iraq]{.mark} always [has]{.mark} had [a massive
potential to destabilize **Turkey, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf region**, and]{.mark} also could affect [**the US**, which has a
strong interest in the region for its global posture. **Any development
in Iraq could easily lead the entire region into a calamity with its
domino-effect**]{.mark}. Due to these crucial points, the
US]{.underline}, Turkey, the EU and all Iraq's neighbors [strongly
support the unity and the territorial integrity of Iraq, and all actors
see that the future of Iraq has come to be the future of the Middle
East.]{.underline}

Today, the scholars, pundits, diplomats, and politicians are all
concerned about the future of Iraq and the possible outcomes for the
region. [All these [concerns come down to]{.mark} a single point:
[whether Iraq will keep its **territorial integrity**]{.mark} or not.
**[A united Iraq]{.mark}** keeping its territorial integrity [is
**crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline} for Turkey and Turkey's relations with
the US and all other regional actors. [Therefore, all [groups within
Iraq politics should look for a **better atmosphere**]{.mark} in which
[to]{.mark} collaborate, [cooperate]{.mark} for the prosperous future of
Iraq, [and **avoid**]{.mark} any [**confrontation** that would lead
to]{.mark} any break-up and another **[humanitarian
calamity]{.mark}**]{.underline} as we are seeing today in Syria.

#### Middle east war goes nuclear

Nader **Entessar** 7/2/**19**, professor and chair of the department of
political science and criminal justice at the University of South
Alabama, Kaveh L. Afrasiabi, professor of political science, taught poli
sci at the University of Tehran, Boston University, and Bentley
University, \"A nuclear war in the Persian Gulf?\", Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2019/07/a-nuclear-war-in-the-persian-gulf/

[Tensions between the United States and Iran are spiraling toward [a
military confrontation]{.mark} that [carries **a real
possibility**]{.mark} **that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will
use nuclear weapons]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Iran's assortment of
asymmetrical capabilities---all constructed to be effective against the
United States---nearly assures such a confrontation. [[The]{.mark}
current [US nuclear posture leaves]{.mark} the Trump administration at
least [open]{.mark} to [the use of **tactical nuclear weapons** in
conventional theaters. Some]{.mark} in the current administration
[may]{.mark} well [think it to be in the best interest]{.mark} of the
United States [to seek a quick]{.mark} and decisive victory [in
the]{.mark} oil hub of the [Persian Gulf]{.mark}---and to do so by using
its nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}

We believe there is a heightened possibility of a US-Iran war triggering
a US nuclear strike for the following reasons:

The sanction regime set against the Iranian economy is so brutal that it
is likely to force Iran to take an action that will require a US
military response. Unless the United States backs down from its present
self-declared "economic warfare" against Iran, this will likely escalate
to an open warfare between the two countries.

In response to a White House request to draw up an Iran war plan, the
Pentagon proposed sending 120,000 soldiers to the Persian Gulf. This
force would augment the several thousands of troops already stationed in
Iran's vicinity. President Trump has also hinted that if need be, he
will be sending "a lot more" troops. [Defeating Iran through
[conventional]{.mark} military [means would]{.mark} likely
[require]{.mark} a half million US forces and US preparedness for [many
casualties]{.mark}. The US nuclear posture review is worded in such a
way that the use of tactical nuclear weapons in conventional theaters is
envisaged, foreshadowing the concern that in a showdown with a menacing
foe like Iran, the nuclear option is on the table. [The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} once again [justify]{.mark} using nuclear
force for the sake of a decisive victory and casualty-prevention, **[the
logic used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Trump's **cavalier attitude** toward nuclear weapons, **trigger-happy
penchant**, and]{.mark} utter [**disdain for Iran**, show]{.mark} that
[he would]{.mark} likely [have **no moral qualm**]{.mark} about issuing
an order to launch a limited nuclear strike]{.underline}, especially in
a US-Iran showdown, one in which the oil transit from the Gulf would be
imperiled, impacting the global economy and necessitating a speedy end
to such a war.

If the United States were to commit a limited nuclear strike against
Iran, it would minimize risks to its forces in the region, defang the
Iranian military, divest the latter of preeminence in the Strait of
Hormuz, and thus reassert US power in the oil hub of the Persian Gulf.
Oil flowing through the Strait of Hormuz is critical to a rising China.
US control over this merchant waterway would grant the United States
significant leverage in negotiations. A limited US nuclear strike could
cause a 'regime change' among Iranian leadership, representing a
strategic setback for Russia, in light of their recent foray in the
Middle East with Iranian backing.

Undoubtedly, [there are several significant negative consequences to a
US use of nuclear weapons, **[opening the way for other nuclear-armed
states to emulate US behavior, and]{.mark} for many other [non-nuclear
weapons states to seek their own]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent]{.mark}
shields**.]{.underline} There would also be a huge outcry in the
international community causing the US global image to suffer.

Will such anticipated consequences represent sufficient obstacles to
prevent a limited U.S. nuclear strike on Iran? With President Trump, who
counts on "bomb Iran" billionaire Sheldon Adelson as one of his main
campaign contributors, **[[the threshold for using nukes]{.mark}
certainly [seems]{.mark} to have been [lowered]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Scenario \[x\]: ISIS

#### ISIS uses stolen US weapons to follow through with their plans to take over Syria and Iraq

supplies of [weapons by **taking advantage** of U.S.]{.mark} weapons
[transfers that]{.mark} may have [violated international
agreements]{.mark} between Washington and its allies, according to a new
report.]{.underline}

As much as 90 percent of ISIS\'s arms and ammunition were found to have
originated in Russia, China and Eastern European states. [The [jihadis
were able to obtain]{.mark} much of [this arsenal as a result of]{.mark}
former President Barack Obama\'s [support for rebels in
Syria]{.mark},]{.underline} U.K.-based Conflict Armament Research
reported after analyzing 40,000 items recovered by its investigators
along ISIS front lines between July 2014 and November 2017. By
purchasing \"large numbers\" of European arms and ammunition and then
diverting them to nonstate actors in Syria without notifying the
sellers, the U.S. reportedly \"violated the terms of sale and export
agreed between weapon exporters\...and recipients.\"

\"[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and Saudi Arabia

Arabia---[have indirectly **allowed IS to obtain**]{.mark} **substantial
[quantities]{.mark}** [of anti-armor ammunition]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
it later added.

ISIS emerged out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and other jihadi groups in the wake
of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and overthrow of its leader, President
Saddam Hussein. After announcing its establishment in 2013, ISIS spread
into Syria to take advantage of the ongoing war between the Syrian
military and the rebel and jihadi groups trying to overthrow it since
2011. In Syria\'s conflict, [the U.S. had been supplying arms to
insurgents opposed to Syrian President]{.underline} Bashar al-Assad
since at least 2012 and, when ISIS began rapidly seizing territory in
2013 and 2014, many U.S.-armed rebel groups were either defeated by the
incoming militants or joined them. [[ISIS]{.mark} reportedly
[received]{.mark} most of its [initial supplies by
**overtaking**]{.mark} Russia-backed Syrian and [U.S.-backed Iraqi
military]{.mark} positions, but later vastly received a massive boost
from the U.S.\'s effort to overthrow Assad.]{.underline}

As ISIS began to take nearly half the country[, the U.S. continued to
train and equip Syrian rebels,]{.underline} using local allies like
Jordan and Turkey as intermediaries. In its report, Conflict Armaments
Group included dozens of photographs of [EU-manufactured [weapons
believed to have been procured by the U.S]{.mark}. and Saudi Arabia,
[shipped to Syrian rebels]{.mark} and [later **obtained by
ISIS**]{.mark},]{.underline} which moved them between Iraq and Syria.
These included a powerful anti-tank missile launcher bought from a
Bulgarian manufacturer by the U.S. Army and wielded by ISIS only weeks
later.

Over the years, growing jihadi influence and territorial losses among
Syrian rebels compelled the U.S. [to cut CIA
support](https://www.newsweek.com/us-cut-support-moderate-syria-rebels-improve-russia-ties-moscow-639762) for
such groups and left allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia to carry the
embattled, fractured opposition. The U.S. ultimately opted to focus
instead on the Pentagon-led effort to back the Syrian Democratic Forces,
a mostly Kurdish coalition of Arabs and ethnic minorities solely
battling ISIS, not Assad.

A year after a U.S.-led coalition began bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria
in 2014, Russia joined the fray by staging a direct military
intervention on behalf of Assad, allowing the Syrian military and its
allies, including Iran-backed militias, to [retake most of the country
previously lost to jihadis and
rebels](https://www.newsweek.com/us-lost-war-syria-iran-russia-winning-final-battle-674833).
The two anti-ISIS campaigns have rushed to what\'s left of ISIS in the
east, with the coalition of Syria, Russia and Iran claiming victory last
month.

#### ISIS is still strong\-\--acquisition of weapons spurs attacks

**Carafano 19**, James Jay Carafano, Vice President of The Heritage
Foundation, Leading Expert on National Security and Foreign Policy,
3/25/19, "The ISIS Caliphate Is Gone -- But ISIS Will Be Back",
<https://www.heritage.org/terrorism/commentary/the-isis-caliphate-gone-isis-will-be-back>

This is a milestone victory for the forces of counterterrorism. But it
is not the end of the [war on
terrorism.](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism) Unfortunately,
[the bad guys will be back on the field soon enough.]{.underline}

It was also disturbingly effective. [**[Tens of thousands]{.mark}**
foreign fighters answered the call, flocking to [join the ranks of
ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, ISIS launched a global media
campaign that promoted radicalization and inspired terrorist attacks
around the world, from North Africa to Europe to the U.S. and Australia.

Taking down the caliphate was crucial. For one[, [ISIS created a
**humanitarian nightmare**]{.mark}. [The group]{.mark}'s so-called
"holy" warriors [stole, raped, enslaved and murdered]{.mark} with
abandon,]{.underline} filling mass graves on a regular basis.

As the group grew, [[it posed a **grave danger to regional
stability**]{.mark} and a terrorist threat worldwide]{.underline}. It
also represented a direct challenge to the West: Could democratic
nations beat back and defeat an armed Islamist force, or were they
nothing more than a "paper tiger," as Usama bin Laden had claimed?

But the terrorists won't go quietly into the night. [When bin Laden was
chased out Africa, he fled to Afghanistan. It was there that he planned
the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United
States.]{.underline}

[And [when Al Qaeda was crushed]{.mark} in Iraq, the [terrorists looked
for another opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. That turned into the ISIS
uprising in Iraq and Syria.

[[Now that the ISIS caliphate has been ground]{.mark} to dust, the
**[remnants will]{.mark} once again [look for a way to regain]{.mark}
their [honor]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To them, that means [[showing they
have]{.mark} the [capacity to slaughter]{.mark} and enslave
[innocents]{.mark}]{.underline} of all creeds, faiths and colors.

Like the fire brigade that just put out the forest fire, the U.S. and
its friends and allies will have to be on watch. [The [sparks will flare
up]{.mark} and try to rage again]{.underline}. The only question is:
[Where will the terrorists go next?]{.underline}

The scattered remnants of ISIS, Al Qaeda and their ilk roam about the
Greater Middle East and beyond. [And [**there is no shortage of places**
where they can]{.mark} find refuge and recuperate, [regroup and **rise
again**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[There's also [no shortage of opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} for
mischief.

The state of Syria remains far from settled. [The [chaos]{.mark} there
[is a welcoming environment for terrorism]{.mark}.]{.underline} And
while remarkable progress has been made in Iraq, sectarian strife
remains ever present.

On top of this, we can't forget [about [Iran]{.mark}, the world's
biggest state sponsor of terrorism. Tehran [**has made accommodations
for Al Qaeda** before]{.mark}]{.underline}. The mullahs might well help
out Sunni extremists again, if it helps make trouble for others.

[[**We can't make the mistake** of dropping Islamist terrorism from
the]{.mark} national and international Bad Guys
[List]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now that ISIS is down, we must to keep it
down. And out.

#### ISIS will get nukes\-\--they have the means and motive to either buy or steal a nuclear bomb

Nada **Eweiss 16**, MA in International Peace and Security from King\'s
College London, \"Non-state actors & WMD: Does ISIS have a pathway to a
nuclear weapon?\", Basic Int, March 2016,
https://www.basicint.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NonStateActors_WMD_Mar2016.pdf

On March 2014, during the Nuclear Security Summit held in the
Netherlands, President Obama identified his number one concern as being
the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.1 UK Home
Secretary Theresa May pinpointed her particular fear of the so-called
Islamic State (ISIS) acquisition of "chemical, biological or even
nuclear weapons" in the "world's first truly terrorist state".2
[Fortunately, there has not yet been [a nuclear]{.mark} or radiological
[terrorist attack,]{.mark} but the smuggling of nuclear material
[remains a]{.mark} pivotal [threat]{.mark} to nuclear security. Al Qaeda
has previously claimed that "acquiring WMD for the defense of Muslims is
a religious duty,"]{.underline}3 and the attacks of 9/11 have clearly
demonstrated the capabilities of groups like Al Qaeda. More recently,
[the Islamic State, which is an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq, has
demonstrated its brutality through various operations]{.underline} (such
as the attacks in Paris in late 2015), [and has attracted foreign
fighters to its extremist Wahhabist ideology.]{.underline}

The Wahhabi mantra enshrines the principle of monotheism, and deems
rituals involving chanting and dancing, alongside the shrines and the
churches as places endorsing shirk (idolatry) and polytheism.4 As a
result, [[ISIS]{.mark} emphasises the importance of eliminating any
religious sect, not aligning with sunniism. Their [religious
discourse]{.mark} has provided them with justifications for the
slaughtering of resistant populations]{.underline}, such as the Yazidis,
[and also has granted them the ability to regard Shi'ism and Sufism
as]{.underline} biddah ([heretical]{.underline} innovations).5

[ISIS members and supporters appear to [glorify martyrdom]{.mark} and
self-sacrifice. Promises of a post martyrdom afterlife]{.underline} such
as the 72 Huris (virgins of Paradise) 6 [play an indispensable role in
convincing its members that they are on the righteous path to heaven,
which proves [an incentive to wage war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many also
see martyrdom as a way to redemption for their sins.7

[Their demonstrated extremism serves as an indication of the extent to
which they will go in order to enforce their goals]{.underline}. Though
the claim by a British Jihadist that ISIS had acquired the materials for
a dirty bomb8 is questionable, their intentions and pathways to other
weapons of mass destruction, even nuclear, remains unclear. [Given the
motivation, [were nuclear weapons within]{.mark} the [reach]{.mark} of
[ISIS]{.mark}, they [would]{.mark} be likely to [use]{.mark} or threaten
use of [them]{.mark}. Moreover, the group would be [unsesceptible
to]{.mark} traditional [deterrence]{.mark} via threat of second strike
as they "lack the minimum degree of risk-adversity to be capable of
being deterred; religious fanaticism has made them immune from fear of
death."9]{.underline}

[[FUNDING SOURCES]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Oil]{.underline}]{.mark}: [ISIS controls]{.underline} a number of
cities in Syria and Iraq, and up to [60% of Syria's total oil
output]{.underline}. Their oil undercuts the world market price and
sells for as little as "\$18 per barrel...when Brent, a world price
reference crude oil was selling for about \$107 per barrel". 10 [Their
oil is smuggled through Jordan and Turkey, and generates up to \$3
million per day in income for the organisation]{.underline}. These
profits are probably declining as a result of airstrikes targeted on oil
facilities.11

[[Tax]{.mark}ation]{.underline}: [ISIS has placed itself in a position
to be able to tax businesses and individuals wishing to do business in
the territory that it occupies]{.underline}, particularly pharmacies,
telecommunication businesses, and farmers. Moreover, ISIS has
incorporated a tax, known as jizyah, solely addressed towards Christian
communities that reside under their rule. The actual amount of the
payment is undefined, but Christians are presented with an ultimatum; to
either pay the jizyah, convert to Islam, or by death.

[[Ransom]{.mark} of hostages]{.underline}: A 2014 UN report suggested
that between [\$35-\$45 million was income generated from ransom
payments]{.underline}.12

[Wealthy [Donors]{.mark}]{.underline}: Many individuals and even states
in the Gulf region have vested interests in supporting ISIS, not least
as a way of weakening President Assad's grip on power in Syria.
Estimates indicate that [ISIS received up to \$40 million from
individuals from Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE between
2013-2014]{.underline}.13

[[Sales]{.mark} of Antiquities]{.underline}: [ISIS has control of 4,500
cultural sites]{.underline}. These incorporated historical artifacts,
archeological sites and museums. Some were destroyed, others were sold
on, [with an estimated income yielded of \$100 million a
year]{.underline}.14

[[Theft]{.underline}]{.mark}: A US intelligence officer estimates that
[[ISIS]{.mark} illegally [seized \$1.5 billion]{.mark} in cash and
military supplies [when they took]{.mark} over
[Mosul]{.mark}]{.underline}.15

[WMD TECHNOLOGY & COMPONENTS ALREADY ACQUIRED]{.underline}

[Biological weapons: A laptop belonging to an ISIS
supporter]{.underline}, was found in November 2014. It [contained
material on how to develop "bubonic plague from infected animals and
turn it into a weapon"]{.underline}.16

[Chemical weapons: ISIS seized a chemical weapons facility]{.underline}
called Muthana in June 2014. This was a former Iraqi government facility
[believed to have]{.underline} approximately [2,500
rockets.]{.underline}17 Most were [filled with sarin]{.underline}, a
deadly nerve agent, according to Mohamed Ali Alhakim, Iraq's UN
ambassador.18

[Low-enriched uranium:]{.underline} The IAEA reported that [ISIS seized
40 kilograms of natural uranium from Mosul University]{.underline} in
Northern Iraq in July 2014.19 There are many obstacles that ISIS would
be unlikely to overcome in turning this low-enriched uranium into a
nuclear device, but [it could be used to fashion a dirty
bomb]{.underline}.

[ESCALATION TO A NUCLEAR DEVICE]{.underline}

[For ISIS to acquire a nuclear weapon they would have to either build an
improvised nuclear device (IND), or acquire an assembled nuclear
weapon]{.underline}. Both involve a series of significant obstacles,
even for well qualified technicians.

Dina Esfandiary, a MacArthur Fellow at the Centre for Science and
Security Studies at King's College London, points out the scale of
industrial endeavour necessary to construct a nuclear weapon:

It took the United States, with its vast resources and advanced knowhow,
six years to develop a nuclear device. It took China roughly 10 years
and Pakistan more than two decades. Needless to say, even for an
established country, developing a nuclear weapon is not simple.20

We should be cautious about overstating the risk, but [the
risk]{.underline} nevertheless [exists]{.underline}. After all, [[hiding
a programme]{.mark} from prying eyes in one of the many stateless zones
[is possible]{.mark}. South Africa's nuclear weapons programme was
hidden in a building that was essentially a warehouse, with no
indication of clandestine activity.]{.underline} 21

It may not be difficult to find much of the necessary information to the
make a crude nuclear weapon on the internet, but accurate blueprints are
a requirement for constructing an IND.22 [[ISIS]{.mark} has attracted
[engineers]{.mark} and scientists as recruits which could form the
backbone of a scientific team [using stolen blueprints to
construct]{.mark} crude [INDs]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Though unlikely, [[it is not impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Dr A.Q.
[Khan, using the resources of the Pakistani state, constructed an global
underground nuclear smuggling network selling nuclear technologies and
Chinese-designed warhead blueprints to Libya and Iran.]{.underline} He
was caught trafficking centrifuge components for uranium enrichment to
Libya's Muammar Al Ghaddafi. 23 It is not beyond the realms of
possibility that ISIS could acquire blueprints, though the designs would
be crude and inefficient.24 But [the principle obstacle to a working
device is the essential fissile material.]{.underline}

ENRICHING URANIUM

Highly enriched uranium ([HEU]{.underline}) ([U235]{.underline}, U233),
[and Plutonium]{.underline} (Pu239) [are the three main fissile
materials used for all current types of nuclear bombs]{.underline}
involving either implosion or gun-type bombs. Uranium that occurs
naturally needs to be converted into uranium hexafluoride gas and
enriched from 0.7% U235 to approximately 90% weapons grade uranium
before being converted into a metal and incorporated into a bomb core.
HEU is dangerous to handle and challenging to prepare because it is far
more unstable and radioactive than natural uranium, and ignites
spontaneously in the air at 150-175° C.

[Enrichment can be achieved through gas centrifuge cascades, gaseous
diffusion, laser separation or other less common techniques. These
require specialist materials, precision, extensive testing and
development]{.underline}. Plutonium does not occur in nature, and is a
product of the chain reaction in a nuclear reactor core. It is extracted
from the waste stream using reprocessing technologies, and presents just
as many complications to non-state actors.

[It is far more likely that [fissile materials]{.mark} would be
[acquired by buying]{.mark} materials on the black market, [or]{.mark}
by [stealing]{.mark} from orphaned sources or nuclear facilities.
However, for uranium to be useful in a nuclear weapon it needs to be
highly enriched; most nuclear reactors use low enriched uranium that
would require further specialised enrichment in order to be relevant.
There remain some [civilian]{.mark} research and power [reactors]{.mark}
that do [use HEU]{.mark}]{.underline}, as do some naval propulsion
reactors. 25 [If stolen in some forms it would require [industrial
processes to convert]{.mark} to a form useful for
[weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, research reactor fuel is "a
mixture of uranium and aluminium, with aluminium cladding", requiring a
separation process that dissolves pieces of fuel in acid to separate the
uranium.26

[Theoretically, such processes [are not beyond the capability of
non-state actors]{.mark}. Al-Qaeda has been indirectly involved in
extracting heroine from opium using similar procedures, "and because of
the toxicity of airborne heroin, primitive glove boxes of the kind that
might be used to handle nuclear material are sometimes used in the
illegal narcotics industry as well".]{.underline} 27

NUCLEAR SMUGGLING

[The United Nations **[I]{.mark}**nternational **[A]{.mark}**tomic
**[E]{.mark}**nergy **[A]{.mark}**gency's Incident and Trafficking
Database [recorded 1,088 incidents of theft, loss or smuggling of
nuclear material]{.mark} around the world between 1993 and 2013. Nuclear
smuggling]{.underline}, involving organised criminal networks with
lucrative operations often operating in underregulated and corrupt
economies, [presents a prime threat to nuclear security]{.underline}.28

[Soon [after]{.mark} the dissolution of [the Soviet Union, countries
near the Black Sea were rife with]{.mark} profound unemployment,
political dissent, porous and under policed borders, and an abundance in
[unregulated]{.mark} sources of nuclear material]{.underline}. 29 [A
third of the world's [HEU]{.mark}-fuelled-research reactors are in this
region]{.underline}.30 [These are often neglected and under-supervised,
making it even more difficult for western countries to provide
assistance and neutralise the threat. [Those seeking]{.mark} to acquire
[WMD]{.mark} or fissile material [would deem it an optimum
environment]{.mark}. Especially since there is no figure to quantify how
much material existed under the Soviet rule, and no way to determine how
much has been lost.]{.underline}

[There have been a number of incidents of nuclear smuggling in the
region, most small and largely ignored by the media]{.underline}.
Vitalie Bricaeg, an official within Moldova's Interior Ministry,
referred in 2011 to Moldova's breakaway region, Transnistria, as an
uncontrollable black hole, even with the involvement of Western Security
services.31 [Teodor [Chetrus]{.mark}, a former KGB informant, [was
arrested]{.mark}]{.underline} that year [[for attempting to]{.mark}
carry out the first of five [ship]{.mark}ments of [HEU]{.mark} amounting
to 22 pounds -- "a fifth of what might be needed to fuel a
Hiroshima-sized nuclear explosion --- but [enough to power a]{.mark}
more technically-advanced "implosionstyle" [nuclear
bomb]{.mark}".]{.underline}32 [He was sentenced [to]{.mark} only five
years in prison. A wiretapped conversations exposed him saying," I am
seeking [an Islamic buyer because they will bomb the
Americans]{.mark}"]{.underline}. 33

[Often black market ogranisations mix nuclear smuggling with other
high-value goods, like drugs, and are involved in widespread corruption.
Georgia's security service arrested Oleg Khinstagov]{.underline}, a
Russian native from North Ossetia, and three other Georgians, including
a low-ranking Georgian interior ministry official, [for attempting to
sell HEU enriched to 89% U235 to "an Islamic buyer".]{.underline}34

PURCHASE OR THEFT OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON

The challenges associated with construction of a nuclear device may lead
a non-state group towards buying or stealing a fully assembled nuclear
weapon. It is unlikely that a state would sell a nuclear device to a
non-state actor, risking threat of nuclear attack against its own
public. 35

However, [some [nuclear weapons are at risk of theft.]{.mark} Most
nuclear weapons have Permissive Action Links (PALs), codes privy to a
few and extremely challenging to unlock, but some do not.]{.underline}36
[[Smaller]{.mark} tactical nuclear [weapons]{.mark} are particularly
vulnerable, not least as they [are]{.mark} designed to be [portable and
have minimal safeguards]{.mark}. A combination of [radicalised
ideologies, minimal security, low pay, personnel shortages and
secrecy]{.mark} could [increase the risk of theft of weapons from any
nuclear]{.mark} armed [state]{.mark}]{.underline}, but some are more
vulnerable than others.

#### Terrorism causes extinction \-\-- retaliatory attacks escalate to great power nuclear war

**Ayson 10** (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the
Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand -- Victoria University of
Wellington, "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic
Effects", Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, 33(7), July)

*A Catalytic Response: Dragging in the Major Nuclear Powers*

A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in
response by the country attacked in the first place, would not
necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable.
Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether [[nuclear terrorism
should]{.underline}]{.mark} ever [[be regarded as]{.underline}]{.mark}
belonging in the category of truly [[**existential**
threat]{.mark}s]{.underline}. A contrast can be drawn here with the
global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange
between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons
in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first
century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside
considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the
Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major
nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear
weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly
awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state
possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds---[a non-state actor
nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear
exchange]{.underline}---**[are not necessarily separable]{.underline}**.
It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and especially
an act of [nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a **chain of events**
leading to a **massive exchange of nuclear weapons** between two or more
of the states that possess them]{.underline}. In this context, today\'s
and tomorrow\'s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during
the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear
arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war
between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were
considered in the late 1950s [and]{.underline} early 1960s as concerns
grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may
require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially
plausible situation where an act of [[nuclear terrorism could lead
to]{.mark} such [a **massive inter-state nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in the event of a terrorist
nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how
Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not
least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious
state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far
too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist
behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some
possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how
might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the
fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from
Russian
stocks,[40](http://www.informaworld.com.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/smpp/section?content=a923238837&fulltext=713240928#EN0040)
and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear
laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular
country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by
Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear
explosion would be "spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its
radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a
wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency
of the explosion, the materials used and, most important ... some
indication of where the nuclear material came
from."[41](http://www.informaworld.com.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/smpp/section?content=a923238837&fulltext=713240928#EN0041)
Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete
surprise, and [[American]{.mark} officials refused to believe that a
terrorist group was fully responsible]{.underline} (or responsible at
all) [[suspicion would shift immediately to **state
possessors**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ruling out Western ally countries
like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as
well, [authorities]{.underline} in Washington [would be left with
a]{.underline} very [short list consisting of North Korea]{.underline},
perhaps [Iran]{.underline} if its program continues, [and]{.underline}
possibly [Pakistan.]{.underline} But at what stage would Russia and
China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear
Cluedo? In particular, [if]{.underline} the act of [nuclear terrorism
occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington\'s
relations with Russia and/or China]{.underline}, and at a time when
threats had already been traded between these major powers,
[would]{.underline} officials and political [**[leaders]{.mark}** not be
tempted to **[assume the worst]{.mark}?**]{.underline} Of course, the
chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United
States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with
Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a
distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at
the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear
terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened
tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow
and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to
consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of
the attack? [[Washington\'s]{.mark} early [response]{.mark} to a
terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil [might]{.mark} also [raise the
possibility of]{.mark} an unwanted (and
**[nuclear]{.mark}**]{.underline} [aided) **[confrontation with Russia
and]{.mark}**]{.underline}/or [**[China.]{.underline}**]{.mark} [For
example]{.underline}, [[in the]{.mark} noise and confusion during the
immediate [aftermath]{.mark} of the terrorist nuclear attack,
[the]{.mark} U.S. [president might]{.mark}]{.underline} be expected to
[[place the]{.underline}]{.mark} country\'s armed forces, including its
[[nuclear arsenal, on]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[high]{.underline}]{.mark}**er stage of
**[[alert]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In such a tense environment, when
careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just
possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign
of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against
them. In that situation, the [[temptations to
preempt]{.mark}]{.underline} such actions [[might]{.mark}
[grow]{.mark}]{.underline}, although it must be admitted that any
preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As
part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as
discussed earlier) [[Washington might]{.underline}]{.mark} decide to
[[order]{.mark} [a significant]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional (or
**[[nuclear) retaliatory]{.underline}]{.mark}** or disarming
[[**attack** against]{.underline}]{.mark} the leadership of the
terrorist group and/or [states]{.underline} seen to support that group.
Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets,
[[Russia and]{.mark}/or [China]{.mark} might interpret such action
as]{.underline} being far too close for their comfort, and potentially
as an [infringement on their spheres of influence]{.underline} and even
on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible
scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main
aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as
Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the "Chechen
insurgents\' ... long-standing interest in all things
nuclear."[42](http://www.informaworld.com.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/smpp/section?content=a923238837&fulltext=713240928#EN0042)
American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise
alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation
from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to
provide.

#### Turkey- US relations worsening\-\--Turkey will sever ties with America unless they stops supporting YPG 

Matthew **Reisener** 9/12/**18**, a program associate at the Center for
the National Interest, \"Here\'s How to Save the U.S.-Turkey Alliance\",
The National Interest,

After decades of cooperation, the alliance between the United States and
the Republic of Turkey appears at risk of permanent fracture.
Disagreements over Syria, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's
creeping authoritarianism, and Turkey's decision to purchase the S-400
anti-aircraft missile system from Russia despite expressed objections
from the United States have caused this once-fruitful relationship to
turn toxic. Last month the Trump administration levied significant steel
and aluminum tariffs against Turkey only days after it imposed sanctions
on them for their continued imprisonment of American pastor Andrew
Brunson on spurious charges of espionage. Just last week, senior Cato
Institute fellow Doug Bandow argued in The National Interest that it is
time to bury the American-Turkish alliance once and for all.

[[While America's relations with Turkey]{.mark} [have]{.mark} certainly
[suffered]{.mark} of late, [they are not yet beyond
saving]{.mark}]{.underline}. Erdoğan's recent electoral victory, the
fragile state of Turkey's economy, and the decreasing need for American
involvement in the fight against Islamic State create a real opportunity
for both sides to meaningfully repair their alliance before further
deterioration occurs. While both Turkey and the United States have
legitimate grievances with one another, the U.S.-Turkey alliance remains
one worth attempting to preserve.

Turkey's long and productive relationship with the United States has
shown it can recover from a more serious rift than the one it currently
faces. Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952 due
to fears of Soviet encroachment and served as an important geopolitical
ally for the Western bloc. However, this partnership was severely tested
in 1975 when the United States enacted an arms embargo against Turkey in
response to its invasion of Cyprus, prompting Turkey to deny America
access to nearly all military bases in the country. After three years of
high tensions, the Carter administration acted to remove the embargo,
recognizing that the benefits of America's alliance with Turkey were
substantial enough to justify an honest attempt at repairing the
fractured diplomatic relationship.

Forty years later, Turkey and the United States once again find
themselves at odds. [Turkey]{.underline} was long viewed as a shining
example of democracy and secularism in the Middle East, but it [has
become increasingly authoritarian under Erdoğan's rule]{.underline},
resulting in the consolidation of executive power, the weakening of
civil society, and the targeting of journalists, activists, and
Erdoğan's political opponents. Turkey has also arrested many Americans,
including the aforementioned Andrew Brunson, in hopes that they could
pressure the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a
Pennsylvania-based Turkish religious leader who Erdoğan blames for
organizing an attempted coup against him in the summer of 2016. Instead,
America responded to the arrest of U.S. consulate employee Metin Topuz
by, "immediately suspending the issuance of non-immigrant visas in
Turkey," resulting in a diplomatic crisis.

However, Syria stands as arguably the most significant point of
divergence between the two allies. [[In the fight against]{.mark} the
[Islamic State]{.mark}, [America]{.mark} had [armed and
supported]{.mark} the People\'s Protection Units
[(YPG)]{.mark}]{.underline}, a Syrian Kurdish militia that composes the
bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The [[YPG was invaluable]{.mark}
as a [ground force against ISIS]{.mark}, [but their]{.mark} alleged
[support for]{.mark} the Kurdistan Workers\' Party
[(PKK]{.mark}),]{.underline} a Kurdish separatist group that has warred
with Turkey for forty years, [[aroused Turkish fears]{.mark} of a
pan-Kurdish military force that could threaten Turkey\'s southern
border. [Turkey view]{.mark}s [American support for the
Kurd]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} as support for an autonomous Kurdish
region in Syria [that [could threaten Turkey\'s territorial integrity
and control]{.mark} over its Kurdish population]{.underline}, while
[America sees Turkey\'s attacks against the YPG as counterproductive in
the broader fight against ISIS.]{.underline}

Turkey has certainly become an irritant to American foreign policy, but
it remains an extremely important military ally. [[Turkey]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} the [second largest military among]{.mark} all [NATO
members]{.mark} and is home to the permanent headquarters for NATO land
forces]{.underline}, as well as critical components of NATO\'s
early-warning missile radar system. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[also has a standing presence at Turkey\'s Incirlik
Airbase]{.mark}]{.underline} (utilized frequently in the fight against
ISIS) which hosts American tactical nuclear weapons and has allowed
America to project military power into the Middle East while offering
protection for regional allies. Turkey\'s growing authoritarianism is
undoubtedly a cause for concern, but America\'s partnerships with Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain prove that America can begrudgingly abide by
such alliances when they support America\'s broader goals[. [Turkey\'s
military prowes]{.underline}]{.mark}[s and strategic geographic
location]{.underline} as a bridge between Europe and Asia [[make it an
invaluable asset to]{.mark} both [America and NATO\'s defense
strategy]{.mark}, and preserving this asset is certainly in America\'s
national interest.]{.underline}

Additionally, [an **[American divorce from Turkey]{.mark} [would]{.mark}
likely [solidify]{.mark} the burgeoning [friendship between Turkey and
Russia]{.mark}**. [Turkey's desire to]{.mark} eschew a missile defense
system [integrat]{.mark}ed into NATO in favor of [Russia's S-400]{.mark}
[raises]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that
Russia could acquire data about]{.mark}]{.underline} how the stealth
capabilities [[American-made F-35]{.mark} matchup against the Russian
system]{.underline}. It [[also raises]{.mark} the [worry that Turkey\'s
commitment to NATO may be waning]{.mark}.]{.underline} After all, Russia
seeks to undermine the strength and influence of NATO in Eastern Europe
while protecting Russian presence and influence in the Middle East.
Moscow knows that supplanting the United States as the primary guarantor
of Turkish security would do much to accomplish these goals.

Still, [it is in Turkey's interest to repair its relationship with the
United States]{.underline}. Turkey's economy is on the brink of
collapse, and with Western nations accounting for nearly two-thirds of
its trade, now would be a particularly inopportune time for Turkey to
suffer a further loss of relations with its NATO partners. Erdoğan's
defiance in the face of Trump's tariffs shows that the disputes over
Syria and the Kurds are currently more important to him than protecting
the Turkish economy. [However, [considering Erdoğan's shortsighted
policies are]{.mark} partially [responsible for the economic crisis, he
may be willing to walk his relations with the West]{.mark}]{.underline}
back from the brink if given a mutually beneficial way to do so in the
interest of eliminating a threat that could undermine his credibility
with the Turkish public.

A simple first step towards nudging Erdoğan down that path is to appoint
an Ambassador to Turkey, a position that has remained vacant since 2017.
I previously argued that the absence of an American Ambassador to Turkey
makes it harder to create a meaningful framework for settling existing
disputes, and the fact that America has not filled this vacancy after
almost a year tells Turkey that repairing their alliance is not one of
America's priorities. [America's concerns regarding the S-400 system,
Erdoğan's authoritarianism, and the jailing of American citizens are
important issues worth pursuing,]{.underline} and [**[America is more
likely to reach favorable settlements]{.mark}** on each of them **[if it
appears fully committed to the diplomatic process]{.mark}**]{.underline}
than it will by imposing punitive and counterproductive tariffs.

The United States must also address the Kurdish and Syrian questions
from which the root of their poor relations with Turkey stem. The
destruction of the ISIS caliphate in Syria has created an opportunity
for Turkey and America to re-negotiate their relationships with the YPG.
While the United States must continue promoting dialogue and cooperation
with Syrian Kurdish groups, [**[it should also accelerate the process of
reclaiming]{.mark} the American [weapons it gave to the YPG]{.mark}**.
Moreover, America should condition future support for the YPG on the
group cutting ties with the PKK.]{.underline} Also, [[Washington
could]{.underline}]{.mark} offer to deepen its existing intelligence
sharing cooperation with Turkey to [[help stop the flow of money and
weapons to the PKK]{.mark} across Syria\'s porous borders]{.underline}.
Because ISIS can no longer acquire or hold territory in Syria, the
United States no longer needs to treat the YPG as a proxy force to
liberate occupied areas. This means [Washington should work to show
Turkey that American support for the protection of Syrian Kurds does not
extend to its support for an independent Kurdistan or a YPG/PKK
alliance]{.underline}.

The United States can further show its commitment to Turkey by
facilitating the reopening of peace talks between Ankara and the PKK,
which collapsed in 2015 due to Turkey's involvement in Syria. Erdoğan
effectively used his offensive against the PKK to rally public support
for his re-election bid this summer but may be more amenable in the
post-election environment if he observes the United States pressuring
the PKK into resuming the ceasefire that ended when the prior
negotiations did. [[Peace talks with the PKK would]{.mark}
[b]{.mark}e]{.underline} long, [[difficult]{.underline},]{.mark} and
provide no assurances of success, [[but showing]{.mark} that [America is
willing to stand beside Turkey]{.mark} through the duration of the
process [would]{.mark} certainly [improv]{.mark}e the [likelihood of
progress]{.mark} being made.]{.underline}

The [United States committed to repairing its relationship with Turkey
in 1978 and must be willing to make that same commitment in
2018]{.underline}. The process of preserving the U.S.-Turkey alliance
will be complex and will require deft and careful diplomacy. The damage
done may ultimately be unable to fully heal, especially if Erdoğan
proves unwilling to compromise even when faced with America's renewed
diplomatic vigor. However, [America's [alliance with Turkey is too
beneficial for the U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates [to
bury]{.mark}]{.underline} without first making every effort to
resuscitate it.

#### Collapsing US-Turkey relations causes Turkey proliferation and an Iran-Turkey nuclear war

**Ahval** 9/14/**18**, Ahval News,\"U.S.-Turkish break could lead to
nuclear nightmare - American Interest\",
https://ahvalnews.com/security/us-turkish-break-could-lead-nuclear-nightmare-american-interest

[[A]{.mark} clean strategic [break between Turkey and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could lead to a **nightmare scenario** of **rampant
nuclear prolif**]{.mark}**eration** [and]{.mark} devastating **[war in
the Middle East]{.mark}**, and should be avoided at all
costs]{.underline}, American Interest founding editor Adam Garfinkle
warned in an article published by the magazine on Sep. 3.

[[The]{.mark} diplomatic [crisis]{.mark} between the United States and
Turkey [has been caused by]{.mark}]{.underline} a complicated tangle of
issues, including the Turkish imprisonment of U.S. citizens and
employees, the purchase by Turkey of Russian missile defence systems
against NATO's wishes, and [**[U.S. support for Syrian-Kurdish
groups]{.mark}** designated as terrorist organisations by
Turkey.]{.underline}

These problems have been exacerbated by the personalities of the two
presidents in charge of the countries, said Garfinkle.

"Presidents Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan are too much alike as
political men: prideful narcissists who elevate personal loyalty over
law, "fact" fabricators who often speak before they think, and whose
exotic minds do not think well much of the time anyway," said Garfinkle.

[The severity of the resulting breakdown of relations and Erdoğan's
apparent unwillingness to compromise have led some experts in the United
States [to conclude that the relationship is beyond
saving.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This, however, [would be a grave mistake that would]{.mark} likely
[lead Turkey to pursue its own nuclear weapons]{.mark} programme, a move
that could have horrendous repercussions for regional
security]{.underline}, said Garfinkle.

[A break with the United States would mean the [removal of U.S.
bases]{.mark} from Turkish soil, as well as the nuclear weapons these
hold. And that [would result in a withdrawal of the "extended
deterrence"]{.mark} these weapons provide Turkey against its security
threats]{.underline}, Garfinkle said.

[[With nuclear armed states]{.mark}, including Pakistan, Israel, Russia,
the United Kingdom and France, [within striking distance of
Turkey]{.mark} on all sides, **[Ankara would feel]{.mark} the [pressure
to secure]{.mark} its defence by procuring [its own nuclear
weapons]{.mark},**]{.underline} the scholar said.

"If that happens, [the Turkish government could probably develop
deliverable nuclear warheads at least on its side of the ocean [within
two]{.mark} to three [years]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Garfinkle.

Moreover, [the existence of [a Turkish nuclear programme would spur
**Iran**]{.mark} to reinvigorate its own programme, [which could mean
**both countries becoming nuclear armed**]{.mark} in just three to five
years.]{.underline}

["The shock to the region would be profound, and possibly very
dangerous,"]{.underline} said Garfinkle.

[The change in Turkey's regional status from a NATO ally to a country
with a "truly independent, unfettered foreign policy" would only
compound that shock.]{.underline}

"When it comes to the Near East, the end of the U.S.-Turkish strategic
relationship would basically come down to this: [[Instead of Turkey
being part of a]{.mark} coherent, [stabilizing]{.mark}, and protective
[U.S.-led power in the region, it would play a more]{.mark} independent
and [divisive r]{.mark}ole]{.underline}," said Garfinkle.

Besides the loss of regional influence that would inevitably hit the
United States as a side effect of losing important bases on Turkish soil
including İncirlik in the south of the country[, a completely
[independent Turkey]{.mark}'s policies would be impossible to predict
and [could lead to]{.mark} terrifying scenarios]{.underline}, Garfinkle
warned.

"Some of the scenarios one can imagine are fairly stunning. For example,
there was an extended time, before the United States even existed, when
Turks and Persians tried to kill one another in large numbers,"
Garfinkle said.

"But as much tragedy as those wars caused back then, it pales in
comparison to the destruction that **[[an Iranian-Turkish nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** would cause in the 21st century for all the
peoples of the region," he said, adding that such a conflict [was not
inevitable but should not be ruled out.]{.underline}

"[It]{.underline} therefore [behooves everyone]{.underline}," Garfinkle
went on, "[to do everything possible to prevent the development of
additional independent nuclear weapons capabilities in or near the
Middle East."]{.underline}

"For the moment, everything possible certainly includes not threatening
to remove U.S. nuclear weapons from Turkey, let alone actually doing it,
for that would be the single most powerful motivating force behind a
Turkish decision to build its own nuclear weapons arsenal," he said.

#### Child soldiers have become commonplace in irregular armies around the world because the international community hasn't done a good enough job criminalizing the activity\-\--while there are a disparate range of factors that cause children to become soldiers, there are two specific developments that have led to the growth of child soldiering: the proliferation of arms, and the lack of consequences countries face for allowing the use of child soldiers to spread

Rights at the Harvard School of Public Health and received a first class

College of Law in London. "Destroying Childhood." Harvard Magazine, 1
Sept. 2005, harvardmagazine.com/2005/09/destroying-childhood.html.

[**[A child has been killed in war every three minutes during the last
decade]{.underline}**. [Many were not civilians. Irregular armies from
Sudan to the Philippines, from Turkey to Colombia, from Kosovo to Iraq
use child soldiers]{.underline}. **[They are]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
shock troops, [the **cannon fodder**, often drugged]{.mark} or drunk [on
the battlefield, **brutalized to commit**]{.mark} the most [**heinous
atrocities and sustain** the **highest casualties**]{.mark}. On a
massive scale**, [children are both victims and agents of war]{.mark}**,
roles that violate long]{.underline}-held and fundamental taboos.

**[[This new reality requires us to question any simpleminded notion we
may have of childhood innocence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** What do we make
of children who are brutal and coldblooded killers? Are they mere tools
of coercive adult commanders? Or responsible agents enacting rational
choices? How should regular armies react when they encounter children in
the thick of combat? And what, if anything, can our society do about it?
These urgent questions animate the readable and passionate Children at
War, by Peter Singer, Ph.D. '01.

Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author as
well of *Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military
Industry[, ]{.underline}*[takes as his starting point that [child
soldiering has become a new standard in contemporary warfare]{.mark},
rather than an exception]{.underline}. Boys and girls, often as young as
10, are recruited to fight and be army sex slaves on every inhabited
continent. [[The phenomenon]{.mark}, he argues, [is]{.mark} much more
[pervasive and troubling]{.mark} than has been
acknowledged.]{.underline}

His central claim is that the exploitation of child soldiers is changing
the nature of contemporary war. It is not merely a question of ethics,
or even of numbers, though the latter are alarming---there are about
300,000 child soldiers by current estimates, just under one in 10 of all
present combatants. Rather it is the broader impact of the child-soldier
phenomenon on contemporary politics that is radically underestimated.
[[The abundance of child soldiers makes war cheaper and easier to
initiate, less logistically burdensome to prolong, and more likely to
recur---it creates]{.mark}, in short, **[a pervasive security
threat]{.mark}. [A whole generation whose childhoods have been
destroyed]{.mark}** **[are growing up with only one usable
skill---warfare]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the words of a 19-year-old
Mozambiquan: "There is no work for me. I have few skills except using a
gun and it's easy money... I used to be FRELIMO \[the government army\],
then joined RENAMO \[the rebel army\], then joined FRELIMO. Now I work
for myself and my group."

This tragedy has already had a direct impact on our societies. Child
soldiers are fighting in every conflict zone where U.S. forces are
engaged. Six current Guantánamo Bay detainees were arrested as child
soldiers. The first American soldier killed in the "war on terrorism" in
Afghanistan was shot by a 14-year-old sniper. The same week that
President Bush delivered his "Mission Accomplished" speech aboard an
aircraft carrier, U.S. marines were fired on by an AK-47-wielding
12-year-old Iraqi boy.

[Despite this reality, [the]{.mark} [ethical]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark} [dilemmas]{.mark} surrounding child soldiers
[have]{.mark} [scarcely]{.mark} [been]{.mark}
[discussed]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Should professional soldiers treat
armed children like any other opponents and go for all-out victory, or
attempt to minimize casualties]{.underline}? Five years ago this dilemma
confronted some British peacekeepers in Sierra Leone. The squad
commander was unwilling to fire when his troops were surrounded by a
rogue children's militia known as the "West Side Boys"---"children armed
with AK-47s," as the commander saw it---so the peacekeepers were taken
hostage. Two weeks later, when a British rescue operation freed the
soldiers, up to 150 of the enemy children died, perhaps more than if the
squad commander had not hesitated initially. As Singer rightly comments,
["\[T\]he core dilemma child soldiers present for professional
militaries is as thorny as they come. Troops now face real and serious
threats from opponents whom they generally would prefer not to harm."
What's more, battling children is even worse than ordinary warfare in
terms of serious psychological after-effects, including depression and
post traumatic stress disorder.]{.underline}

Singer argues that [[there is a "child soldier doctrine" at work,
lowering taboos and spreading from country to country.]{.mark} But [are
there]{.mark} instead [a disparate range of
factors?]{.mark}]{.underline} Take the question of recruitment.
According to Singer, [[brute force]{.mark} is "a primary method" of
[recruitment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly it characterizes some of
the best-documented situations. A 14-year-old explains, "I was nine
years old. Six rebels came through our yard.... They said: 'We want to
bring a small boy like you---we like you.' My mother didn't comment; she
just cried. My father objected.... They argued with him at the back of
the house. I heard a gunshot. One of them told me, 'Let's go, we've
killed your father.' A woman rebel grabbed my hand roughly and took me
along. I saw my father lying dead as we passed." The Tamil Tigers in Sri
Lanka routinely use abduction to reach their conscription targets (up to
60 percent of their forces are recruited between the ages of 10 and 16).
[In Uganda, only 200 of the 14,000 active members of the Lords
Resistance Army (LRA) are trained adult soldiers; the rest of this rebel
force, responsible for 10 years of civil war and more than 100,000
casualties, are coerced child soldiers.]{.underline}

But [a second]{.underline}, quite different, [phenomenon is the
[revolutionary zeal]{.mark} that propels disenfranchised children to
volunteer themselves, often to avenge their humiliated or decimated
communities]{.underline}: "My father, mother, and brothers were killed
by the enemy. I became angry....And to revenge is only to have a gun....
That is the decision I took to become a soldier." Sixty percent of
children serving in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the
infamous FARC) are volunteers. So are 57 percent of child soldiers in
East Asia, according to UNICEF data. The percentages of teen-agers
voluntarily engaged in the "war on terror" are higher. In these cases,
children's involvement in armed combat is an expression of individual
agency and political engagement. Given Singer's own claim that "roughly
two of every three child soldiers have some sort of initiative in their
own recruitment," how can forced recruitment be the primary method of
enlisting children?

[There are other explanations, too, including [economic
necessity]{.mark}]{.underline}. A third of all children in Africa suffer
severe hunger. To quote a 12-year-old: "I don't know where my mother and
father are. I had nothing to eat. I joined the gunmen to get food.... I
was with the other fighters for eight months. There was nothing good
about that life."

Finally, there is the phenomenon that anthropologist William Murphy
calls ["[patrimonialism]{.mark}," a form of affiliation that ties
vulnerable children to unrelated but powerful and domineering adults
within their communities---a response to the pervasive "protection
vacuum" that afflicts so many thousands of orphaned, displaced, or
otherwise dispossessed children.]{.underline} AIDS complicates this
picture: as elders able to mentor rootless youth are decimated, children
attach themselves to adults capable of ordering their universe, however
brutally.

[Singer may thus be [wrong to focus on a unitary "child soldier
doctrine."]{.mark} He is [right]{.mark}, however, [to argue that]{.mark}
several very [specific developments]{.mark} have [contributed to the
growth of child soldiering]{.mark} as an effective global weapons
platform today. The [proliferation of small arms is
critical]{.mark}]{.underline}---cheap, light, and simple weapons which
are as child-friendly to use as they are deadly to encounter.
Chillingly, he points out that in Sudan an AK-47 costs the same as a
chicken, in northern Kenya the same as a goat. Small arms represent less
than 2 percent of the cost of the global-arms trade, but are responsible
for about 90 percent of contemporary war casualties. Recruiters
measuring children to see whether they are tall and strong enough to
carry arms have an ever-easier time finding qualifying candidates as the
weapons get smaller and lighter.

[This practical development [dovetails with an equally crucial political
factor: whatever the moral stigma of using child soldiers, the political
and legal consequences are negligible.]{.mark}]{.underline} Recruiting
child soldiers is no longer taboo. [The Tamil Tigers, for example, have
set up a computerized system for managing child recruitment and
established a military unit consisting entirely of child orphans, yet
the organization has been included in peace talks about the future of
Sri Lanka without prior confirmation that it has ended its recruitment
of children.]{.underline}

[There is also the question of utility. Because of the terrifying
milieus from which many child recruits are drawn and the brutal,
brainwashing military induction techniques,]{.underline} children [turn
out to be devastatingly useful soldiers]{.underline}, "damn near as good
as conscript-drafted Americans or Europeans in the use of NATO tactics,"
a retired Green Beret officer told Singer. Cheap, plentiful, and
effective: it is hardly surprising that the numbers of child recruits
appear to be rising.

[Explaining the reasons for child soldiering, however, is much easier
than suggesting effective solutions]{.underline}. So far, [[the greatest
strides in addressing the problem have been made in the legal sphere,
**which does not require radical economic or political
restructuring.**]{.underline} [We now have]{.underline}]{.mark} [a host
of [international conventions]{.mark}]{.underline}---on the laws of war,
on the worst forms of child labor, on children's rights---[[which
explicitly focus on eliminating the use of child
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}. In February 2002, a new Optional Protocol
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the Involvement of
Children in Armed Conflict, came into force. It prohibits signatory
states from compulsorily recruiting under-18-year-olds, and requires
them to do whatever they can to keep volunteers under 18 from deployment
in active combat. Eighty-five countries, including the United States,
have ratified this instrument. In another significant development, the
statute of the newly established International Criminal Court (ICC)
makes recruitment or use of children under 15 for warfare a war crime
punishable by the court.

[The progress goes beyond getting laws on the books]{.underline}. The UN
Security Council now sets aside a day each year to discuss the issue of
child soldiers, naming and proposing sanctions against countries that
use them and instituting monitoring systems to track the circumstances
of children involved in armed conflicts. The ICC, as part of its first
investigations, has chosen two conflicts that include massive
children's-rights violations: the LRA-led conflict in northern Uganda
and the current war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Child
recruiters in these two conflicts may well be the first to be
prosecuted. Domestic legislation is also being passed, with tribunals in
individual countries providing additional means of prosecuting child
recruiters. In Sierra Leone, for example, the prosecutor for the special
court set up to prosecute war criminals after the recent civil war has
said, "If you go after women and children, you will pay the price."
These encouraging and important steps establish clear international
standards and provide leaders with tools for enforcing sanctions and
criminal penalties.

[[But the tragic reality is that no one has yet been convicted of
recruiting child soldiers,]{.mark} or stopped from traveling or using a
Swiss bank account because of this violation of international
law]{.underline}. What use is naming and shaming if (as the Tamil Tigers
and the LRA have done) the targets blatantly lie and are indifferent to
international censure?

[**[Without effective criminalization, the split between]{.mark} verbal
[denunciation of child soldiering and de facto support]{.mark}** of the
practice **[is likely to continue. Weapons sales]{.mark}** and
unmonitored aid **and trade [are a critical part of the problem. The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**, Singer notes**, [sends a
quarter-billion dollars' worth of military equipment]{.mark}** and
training assistance [per year **to states that use child
soldiers**]{.mark}, such as Colombia and Rwanda. As he points out**,
[stigmatizing and criminalizing commercial transactions with offending
states is more likely to be effective than]{.mark}** yet more
**[international norm setting. But this is just another example of a
broader problem: the familiar reluctance of powerful states to use their
political capital to resolve humanitarian issues that don't impinge on
their immediate self-interest]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

hundreds of [thousands of people have died]{.mark} --- nobody knows the
exact number.]{.underline} Can you describe the country's history for

situation?

NT: South Sudan is the youngest nation on earth. Its independence day
was in July 2011. The [South Sudanese won their independence
through]{.underline} very [long, bloody struggles]{.underline} with the
north of the country, today Sudan, that went back into the 1950s. But
[the United States played a significant part.]{.underline} There was a

EM: We "midwifed" it.

It's indelicate to some degree, but there's a lot of truth to it. The

a [civil war]{.mark}, an exceptionally brutal war.]{.underline}

I travelled there in 2014, just after the war began, in 2015 again, and
then earlier this year. [It's [gotten progressively worse.]{.mark} The
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations Special Envoy [mentioned the
possibility of **genocide, a Rwanda-type
situation.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is what people were telling me even in 2015, when I did the
reporting for my book. A lot of times people would whisper the word
"Rwanda" to me, saying that that was their great fear. Looking at it
from afar, this is what I really fear today. We're right at the
precipice now.

I spent several weeks earlier this year in [[a town called
Leer]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[could be a model for the bloodletting
to come.]{.mark} This was a wasteland. [The]{.mark} entire [town was
razed to the ground.]{.mark}]{.underline} I walked through [[a
field]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[was strewn with human remains, skulls,
rib cages, femurs, spinal columns.]{.mark} It was a horrorscape. People
there were too afraid to even bury their dead.]{.underline}

[**[This is starting to happen in other areas]{.mark} of the country as
well**; areas that for the last couple of years have been untouched by
war. But [it's spreading.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We're seeing [[ethnic killings, machete killings, village
burnings.]{.mark} It's looking exceedingly grim.]{.underline} I'm
actually right now looking for an outlet to send me back, because there
are stories that need to be told there.

And [it's exceedingly difficult for reporters]{.underline}. South
Sudanese reporters who do this type of work --- it's a very dangerous
environment for them. [[Reporters are threatened. They're kidnapped and
beaten. Some are killed. **No one has been held accountable** for these
beatings, abductions, killings.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's open season on
reporters there.

It's a sad situation, and it's been one. I have a tough time
understanding what the [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration's
modus operandi was with South Sudan. It [[resisted]{.mark}, for years,
[imposing an arms embargo on the country]{.mark} --- something that
seemed to be a no-brainer.]{.underline}

EM: And there is a child soldier piece as well, right?

NT: [[Under]{.mark} the [C]{.mark}hild [S]{.mark}oldier
[P]{.mark}rotection [A]{.mark}ct, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[isn't allowed to give aid to countries that have children under
arms.]{.mark} [But, year after year, we gave South Sudan a pass.]{.mark}
[This was]{.mark} all [done with]{.mark} the [thinking]{.mark} that
[somehow]{.mark} then [we'd have more leverage]{.mark} over them[. But
instead they kept their child soldiers, kept importing arms, and kept
killing their own people.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the last couple of weeks [the United States pushed for an actual arms
embargo, but no one in the international community wanted to sign on to
it. So it crashed and burned at the United Nations. When the threat of
an arms embargo disappeared, so did any kind of leverage. The Kiir
government now has a free hand.]{.underline}

EM: [Why]{.underline} has the [United States been so involved in South
Sudan?]{.underline} What does the Obama administration view as American
interests in South Sudan?

NT: I wish I had an answer for you. I tried asking State Department
representatives, went to the National Security Council at the White
House and tried asking these same questions, and it was [always an
incoherent answer.]{.underline} I could never quite make heads or tails
of it.

[They were always talking about leverage]{.underline}, that they didn't
want to foreclose the possibility. [[They thought engagement was better
than cutting South Sudan off.]{.mark} [But]{.mark} you have
[people]{.mark} that [are dying at the hands of a government.]{.mark}
The United States knew this full well.]{.underline}

[At some point you have to say]{.underline}, "This idea of [[leverage
hasn't worked.]{.mark} Maybe **[it's time to cut off the flow of
arms.]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [It seems like a no-brainer, but they were
playing some sort of long game that seems to have gotten away from
them.]{.underline}

The [Impact of Trauma on the Body [Beyond psychological
suffering]{.mark} from the symptoms of PTSD]{.underline}, traumatized
populations show significantly [elevated levels of physical morbidity
and mortality.]{.underline} As outlined above, in recent years, evidence
has mounted that severe anxiety states [-- [stress]{.mark} at a
traumatic level -- [lead to]{.mark} a functional and structural
**[alteration of the brain]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Eckart et al.,
submitted; Kolassa & Elbert, 2007). The [co-occurrence of several
pathogenic processes includes a permanent alteration of bodily
processes, due to a state of persistent readiness for an alarm
response.]{.underline} Psychobiological abnormalities in PTSD are
observed as psychophysiological, neurohormonal, neuroanatomical, and
immunological effects (Boscarino, 2004; Kolassa et al., 2007; Neuner et
al., 2008; Schnurr & Jankowski, 1999). [Trauma survivors, including
child soldiers, frequently report **[high rates of physical
illness]{.mark}**, involving a variety of physiological
systems]{.underline}. In a recent study (Sommershof et al., 2009), we
observed a [substantial and clinically relevant [change in immune
function]{.mark}, based on a 34% reduction of naïve and a 54% reduction
of regulatory T cells following war and torture related
PTSD]{.underline}. Thus, there [seems to be a positive correlation not
just between developed psychiatric illnesses and prior trauma, but also
[a significant relationship between]{.mark} the amount of [traumatic
exposure and **poor**]{.mark} **physical [health]{.mark}** outcomes. An
emerging body of literature is successfully exploring the relationship
between trauma-spectrum disorders, foremost PTSD and increased somatic
complaints, such as [**cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and
gastrointestinal** complaints]{.mark}; various types of somatic
pain;]{.underline} susceptibility to infectious diseases; [vulnerability
to hypertension and atherosclerotic heart disease; abnormalities in
thyroid and other hormone function; [increased **risk of
cancer**]{.mark} and susceptibility to [infections and autoimmune
disorders;]{.mark} and problems with pain perception, pain tolerance,
and **[chronic pain]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Altemus, Dhabhar, & Yang,
2006; Boscarino, 2004; Dyregrov & Yule, 2006; Elbert et al., 2009;
Escalona, Achilles, Waitzkin, & Yager, 2004; Ford et al., 2001; Ironson
et al., 1997; Joshi & O'Donnell, 2003; Karunakara et al., 2004; Kessler,
2000; McEwen, 2000; Neuner et al., 2008; S. J. Roberts, 1996; Rohleder &
Karl, 2006; Schnurr & Jankowski, 1999; Seng, Graham-Bermann, Clark,
McCarthy, & Ronis, 2005; Somasundaram, 2001; van der Veer, Somasundaram,
& Damian, 2003). It is important to keep in mind that in
post-disaster/conflict regions, children and their parents, who remain
in the area or are forced to migrate (asylum seekers, refugees, IDPs),
have not only survived an unusual number and types of traumatic
stressors, but also had to endure poverty related or other social
stressors and adversities, such as domestic violence, family separation,
and child labor (Catani et al., 2008; Catani et al., 2009). [Child
[soldiering]{.mark} additionally [contributes to]{.mark} the already
**heightened [stress load]{.mark}** due to adversity]{.underline}.
Taking into account the absence of health services in this context, high
child, adolescent, and adult mortality, epidemic rates of disease
transmission, as well as low life expectancy rates in many of today's
(post-)conflict settings come as no surprise (AACAP, 1998; Dyregrov &
Yule, 2006; Ehntholt & Yule, 2006; Elbert et al., 2009; Karunakara et
al., 2004; Miranda & Patel, 2005; Neuner et al., 2008; Neuner, Schauer,
Catani, Ruf, & Elbert, 2006; Odenwald et al., 2007). 332 E. Schauer and
T. Elbert Further Psychological Consequences of Trauma Exposure [There
are a multitude of further psychological consequences of experiencing
traumatic life-threat. In sum, the [response to]{.mark} war-related
[trauma]{.mark} by ex-combatants and former child soldiers in countries
directly affected by war and violence [is complex and renders]{.mark}
the [survivors vulnerable]{.mark} to various forms of **psychological
disorders**, whereby stressors may have a different impact during
different developmental periods]{.underline}. [[During childhood]{.mark}
and adolescence, the mind and brain are particularly plastic and hence,
[stress has]{.mark} a great [potential to affect]{.mark} **cognitive and
affective [development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Exposure to significant
stressors during sensitive developmental periods causes the [brain to
develop along a stress-responsive pathway.]{.underline} As a
consequence, the brain and mind become organized in a way to facilitate
survival in a world of deprivation and danger, enhancing an individual's
capacity to rapidly and dramatically shift into an intense angry,
aggressive, or fearful fleeing/avoiding state when threatened. This
pathway, however, is costly because it is associated with increased risk
of developing serious medical and psychiatric disorders, like the
aforementioned PTSD, and is unnecessary and non-adaptive in peaceful
environments (Elbert et al., 2006; Teicher, Andersen, Polcari, Anderson,
& Navalta, 2002). Chronic danger or exposure to extreme stress requires
costly developmental adjustment in children. Though the core symptoms of
PTSD are the most extensively studied psychological consequences of war,
they are clearly not the only ones. In addition to associated features
like survivor's guilt or shame and changes in personality, survivors may
also suffer from substance-use disorders, affective disorders, including
major depression, suicidal ideation, and various forms of anxiety
disorders (Bichescu et al., 2005; Boscarino, 2004, 2006; Catani et al.,
2009; Johnson & Thompson, 2008; Keane & Kaloupek, 1997; Lapierre,
Schwegler, & Labauve, 2007; Odenwald et al., 2007; Schauer, 2008).
Surviving traumatic experiences might be followed by social withdrawal,
loss of trust, major changes in patterns of behaviour or ideological
interpretations of the world, and feelings of guilt and shame
(Dickson-Gomez, 2002; Janoff-Bulman, 1992). Drug Abuse Parallel to the
trafficking of light weapons, the global commerce of illicit
pharmacological stimuli served as an effective catalyst of war. (Maclure
& Denov, 2006), p. 127 Systematic drug taking is especially reported
among West African-based militia movements. In fact, [some authors
consider hallucinatory drug intake a critical factor that has
contributed to the desensitization of boy soldiers during their
prolonged exposure to violent aggression and to prepare them for
combat]{.underline}. Utas and Jorgel (2008) described, in their account
of the 'West Side Boys' child soldiers of Sierra Leone, how [most
[fighters used drugs]{.mark} in abundance: crack **[cocaine]{.mark}**,
smoked **[heroin]{.mark}**, ephedrine, benzodiazepines, **[and
marijuana]{.mark}**]{.underline}: 14 The Psychological Impact of Child
Soldiering 333 [Drugs were used in military navigation both to enable
soldiers to act courageously and ultra-violently, and also to make
fighters relax in extreme settings of fear]{.underline}. (Utas & Jorgel,
2008, p. 502) [[Drug abuse]{.mark} may also [develop as]{.mark} a means
of [coping]{.mark} with PTSD]{.underline} (Chilcoat & Breslau, 1998;
Shipherd, Stafford, & Tanner, 2005). Gear (2002) notes that [substance
abuse can be seen as a way [to **escape**]{.mark} **the [emotional
burden]{.mark}**]{.underline} associated with extreme poverty and
unemployment, at the same time being an attempt to cope with
trauma-related symptoms, and thus, is a form of self-medication. In
several samples of Somali (ex-)combatants, our group (Odenwald, Hinkel,
& Schauer, 2007; Odenwald et al., 2007) found that [those with PTSD used
more drugs in order to 'selfmedicate,' especially those who indicated
that drug use helped them forget stressful war experiences]{.underline}
(Odenwald et al., 2005). The main drug (ab)used in Somalia are the
leaves of the khat shrub that contain the amphetamine-like cathinone. In
these studies, we could clearly demonstrate that PTSD leads to higher
khat intake and this, in turn, leads to a higher risk for the
development of psychotic symptoms, such as paranoia. In a large
cross-sectional household survey, involving 4854 randomly selected
persons of the general population of Hargeisa, Somaliland, we (Odenwald
et al., 2005) observed that 12 years after the end of the liberation war
and 6 years after the last fighting, [16% of the ex-combatants were
severely impaired by complex psychological suffering]{.underline},
mostly severe psychotic disorders intermingled with drug abuse,
trauma-related disorders, and emotional problems. In most cases,
uncontrollable behaviour, like aggressive outbreaks, had led to the
situation that helpless family members had chained them for years to
concrete blocks or trees in the backyard of their compounds or that they
had ended up in prison. Among the male adult population, former
combatants with civilian war survivors and persons who never had been
confronted with war (i.e. those who managed to flee abroad before the
war) were compared. The rate of 8% of PTSD, depression, and drug abuse
disorder in the civilian war survivors doubled among the group of
ex-combatants, and reached less than 3% in those without direct war
exposure. In a city like Hargeisa the Capital of Somaliland, every
fourth household had to care for one severely affected, dysfunctional
young man in the household, drawing resources from all members of the
household and forcing the household to lose out on the support and
capacity of one male family member. Depression and Suicidality [The
significant [correlation between]{.mark}
**[p]{.mark}**ost-**[t]{.mark}**raumatic **[s]{.mark}**tress
**[d]{.mark}**isorder [and]{.mark} **clinical [depression]{.mark}** is
scientifically well known]{.underline}. In a large study by Vinck and
colleagues (Vinck et al., 2007) in Northern Uganda, it was found that
[52% of formerly abducted children suffered from depression
symptoms]{.underline}. A follow-up review of Pham et al. (Pham et al.,
2009) with former abductees showed that [40% fulfilled the symptom
criteria for major depression]{.underline}. In our study (Pfeiffer et
al., submitted), using a child soldier sample again from Northern
Uganda, 16% of children who were ever 334 E. Schauer and T. Elbert
abducted had a fully developed major depression, with this rate
increasing to 24% in those who had stayed in captivity 1 month or
longer. The most disturbing finding is the risk of suicidality in the
former child soldier sample of Pfeiffer and colleagues (Pfeiffer et al.,
submitted). In this group, 34% of children showed a risk of suicidality
(17% of children at high risk), with this rate rising to 37% (25% at
high risk) in those who were forced to stay in captivity for 1 month and
longer. [Post-Vietnam studies showed highly [elevated **risks of
suicide**]{.mark} among ex-combatants and veterans of war]{.underline}
(Hendin & Haas, 1991; Kang & Bullman, 2008; Lester, 2005). [Having been
an agent of killing and having been a failure at preventing death and
injury of others are especially related more strongly to general
psychiatric distress and suicide attempts]{.underline} (Fontana,
Rosenheck, & Brett, 1992). The few [investigations that there are among
children indicate a significant [correlation between]{.mark} a childhood
diagnosis of **[PTSD and suicidal ideation]{.mark}**. Guilt might play
an important mediating factor]{.underline}. In the case of child
soldiers, [the guilt about having killed members of the family, friends,
or community members emerged as a key predictor of suicidal
ideation]{.underline} (Pfeiffer et al., submitted). Authors suggest that
[suicidal ideation may be increased additionally when the child's
functioning is impaired]{.underline} (Famularo, Fenton, Kinscherff, &
Augustyn, 1996). In an epidemiological study in the LTTE-controlled
areas of North-Eastern Sri Lanka (Elbert et al., 2009), we observed a
[highly significant relationship between PTSD and risk for
suicide]{.underline}, which was diagnosed for 26% of the children with
PTSD, but only for 7% of children without PTSD. The reasons for these
epidemic proportions are unclear. Researchers suggest that for some
youngsters[, self-poisoning seemed to be the preferred or only method of
dealing with difficult situations]{.underline} (Eddleston, Sheriff, &
Hawton, 1998). [[Child soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} [might simply
**[lack]{.mark} adequate [coping]{.mark} or interpersonal
[skills]{.mark}**, such as the ability to communicate anger and sadness,
or might not be able to place trust in supportive and positively guiding
relationships with adults.]{.underline} Dissociation and Derealization
[[Another,]{.mark} so-called associative [feature]{.mark} of severe
child traumatization, often seen in former child soldiers, [is]{.mark}
the phenomenon of '**[dissociation.]{.mark}**' During times of trauma,
fight or flight responses are rarely options for children,]{.underline}
as they are often physically unable to defend themselves or escape. The
[most readily accessible response to the pain of trauma may be to
activate dissociative mechanisms]{.underline}, involving
[[**disengagement** from the]{.mark} external
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biological defense mechanisms are activated
by the central nervous system, such as depersonalization, derealization,
numbing, and in extreme cases, catatonia and 'tonic immobility' (Perry &
Pollard, 1998). The individual cascade of defense mechanisms that a
survivor has gone through during the traumatic event can replay itself
whenever the fear network, which has evolved peritraumatically, is
activated again by internal or external triggers. Whereby some survivors
have experienced mainly peritraumatic sympathetic activation 14 The
Psychological Impact of Child Soldiering 335 (fleeing-feeling anxious;
fighting-feeling angry and acting out), others went through the whole
defense cascade, with parasympathetic dominance as an end point (e.g.
tonic immobility, no more voluntary movement, sensory de-afferentation,
loss of muscle tonus, fainting) (Schauer & Elbert, 2008). Thus,
peritraumatic dissociation might be allowing the child to
psychologically and physically survive the trauma. Over time, however,
it often becomes nonadaptive, emerging at inappropriate times during,
for example, situations that may trigger verbal or nonverbal/bodily
memories of earlier trauma or at any other time of perceived emotional
threat. Children who have learned to cope with trauma by dissociating
are vulnerable to continuing to do so in response to minor stresses.
[The continued use of dissociation as a way of coping with stress
interferes with the capacity to fully attend to life's ongoing
challenges. During dissociative episodes, the child may stare off and
appear as if he or she is daydreaming]{.underline} (Sack, Angell,
Kinzie, & Rath, 1986). Such [[children may be **misdiagnosed**]{.mark},
e.g. as suffering from ADHD, inattentive type]{.underline} (Joshi &
O'Donnell, 2003). Other children may freeze in response to certain
activating stimuli. Caregivers or teachers may misinterpret this
reaction as an act of defiance. If confronted, more anxious children can
quickly escalate to feeling threatened, 'frozen,' and ultimately resort
to a classic fight or flight response by becoming aggressive or
combative over relatively minor events (Joshi & O'Donnell, 2003; Schauer
& Elbert, 2010). Other children may react to stressors by dissolving
into regressed, dissociative states that may contain micropsychotic
episodes, including auditory command hallucinations. It is not uncommon
for severely traumatized children to hear voices commanding them to harm
themselves or others, which is a dangerous, unpredictable condition.
Consequently, such adolescents can be erroneously misdiagnosed as
suffering from a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia.
Anti-social and Disruptive Behavior PTSD is also significantly
associated with negative behavior against an individual's own family,
the expression of anger and hostility to others, and self-harm (Burton,
Foy, Bwanausi, Johnson, & Moore, 1994; Deykin, 1999; Deykin & Buka,
1997; Dodge, 1993; Dutton et al., 2006; Friedman & Schnurr, 1995;
Golding, 1999; Joshi & O'Donnell, 2003; Lewis, 1992; Perry & Pollard,
1998). [Research shows that [former]{.mark} child [soldiers have
**difficulties**]{.mark} **in [controlling]{.mark} aggressive
[impulses]{.mark}** and have little skills for handling life [without
violence]{.mark}. These [children show]{.mark} **on-going
[aggressiveness]{.mark}** within their families and communities, even
after relocation to their home villages]{.underline} (Wessels, 2006). In
a qualitative study, Magambo and Lett (2004) reported that [former child
soldiers in northern Uganda mainly applied physical violence to resolve
conflicts]{.underline}. Although the children sympathized with victims
of violence, [they **[could not]{.mark} even [think of non-violent
alternatives]{.mark}**, reflecting an absence of adequate social
skills]{.underline}. Most former child [soldiers have spent several
critical years of their development in captivity]{.underline}, under the
constant threat of abuse and manipulation by their 336 E. Schauer and T.
Elbert commanders. Most probably, this period affects the development of
a personal and collective identity (Kanagaratnam, Raundalen, &
Asbjornsen, 2005). In general, [children exposed to war and child
soldiering show a strong identification with their own
group]{.underline} (Gloeckner, 2007; Jensen & Shaw, 1993) and develop a
worldview dominated by political and nationalistic categories (Punamaki
& Suleiman, 1990), which often includes pro-war attitudes (Feshbach,
1994). In the Gloeckner (2007) study, it emerged that the longer
children had stayed in abduction, the stronger was their rebel-related
collective identity. But it may be that their collective identification
might occur post hoc after return to their home communities. Gloeckner
explained that questions and discussions of family and community members
about the cruelty of the LRA's actions may activate a process of
reasoning about what had happened. Former beliefs about 'right' and
'wrong' actions might clash with current ones, and in order to regain
cognitive homeostasis, identification with the rebel group is aspired.
Interestingly, this study showed a positive correlation between
collective identification and reactive aggression (physical and verbal
aggression and anger). In addition, Gloeckner ( 2007) reported that
formerly abducted children with PTSD might be especially vulnerable to
accepting simplistic models of 'good versus bad' -- a black and white
worldview, which is a known cognitive distortion. Although a rigid
political view might be protective during exposure to war events, it
might facilitate violent behavior after returning from the fighting to
individuals' home communities. [Children living in conditions of
political violence and war have been described as 'growing up too soon'
and 'losing their childhood']{.underline} (Boothby & Knudsen, 2000;
UNICEF, 2005, 2006). Levels of conscience seemed to be significantly
related to the severity of PTSD symptomatology, but also with negative
schematizations of self and others and lower self-efficacy ratings
(Goenjian et al., 1999; Joseph, Brewin, Yule, & Williams, 1993; Saigh,
Mroueh, Zimmerman, & Fairbanks, 1995). Ideological Commitment There is
also the discussion on ideological commitment of former child soldiers
to a cause and its influence on mental health. Some studies (Muldoon &
Wilson, 2001; Punamaki, 1996) indicate a protective mechanism,
associating strong ideology with good mental health in adolescents,
however, mainly in individuals who were exposed to low levels of
political violence. A recent study among Tamil child soldiers shows that
this protective mechanism only worked in the group of those who were not
among the highest exposure intensity group, e.g. length of exposure,
being wounded, having killed, having tortured, direct combat
(Kanagaratnam et al., 2005). Tibetan refugee children also reported that
the sense of participating in their nation's struggle against an
oppressor and their strong Buddhist beliefs would have protected them
against mental-health difficulties and accelerated the healing process
(Servan-Schreiber, Le Lin, & Birmaher, 1998). Cognitive appraisals of
experiences seem to matter in symptom development in various forms 14
The Psychological Impact of Child Soldiering 337 and [strong feelings of
guilt and responsibility might increase trauma symptoms]{.underline}. In
Kanagaratnam's study (Kanagaratnam et al., 2005) personal achievement in
combat, popularity, knowledge and experience acquired by being a
combatant, friendship, and the support of the community were considered
as the best of combat life by the youngsters; death of friends, killings
of their own people, guilt of being responsible for unnecessary
killings, and being confronted with morally conflicting situations were
the worst experiences for most of them. Cognitive, Educational, and
Occupational Impairment When comparing abductees with non-abductees,
Blattman (2006) came to the conclusion that [especially [traumatic
experiences]{.mark} during abduction [had an adverse impact on
education]{.mark}, less years of schooling, greater **[reading
problems]{.mark}**, lower occupational functioning, and **[lower work
quality]{.mark}** later in life.]{.underline} What research has shown is
that exposure to [[trauma]{.mark} in formative years may [affect]{.mark}
the [maturation of the]{.mark} central [nervous system]{.mark} and the
regulatory neuro-endocrine systems]{.underline}, as outlined above.
Resulting from exposure to traumatic stress and PTSD, the
[**[inability]{.mark} to concentrate** and learn often [translates
into]{.mark} a **refusal to attend** school and eventual
**[drop-out]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Dodge, 1993). In a study by Duncan
(2000), [college enrollment rates continued to drop]{.underline} at each
subsequent semester until, by their senior year, only 35% of students
who had suffered multiple abuses were in attendance. In addition,
[adolescents with PTSD,]{.underline} compared to adolescents who have
suffered a stressful experience but did not develop PTSD, were [shown to
have significantly lower scores on a standardized achievement test
compared to their controls]{.underline} (Saigh, Mroueh, & Bremner,
1997). A study by McFarlane and colleagues (McFarlane et al., 1987)
showed that 18% of surveyed children after a disaster were
underachieving educationally after 8 months; this figure had a
statistically significant increase to 25% at 26 months. The
[[underachieving children were]{.mark} also [those with]{.mark} the
**[highest trauma]{.mark} symptom scores** and with the most days absent
from school, reporting headaches, stomachaches, and feeling miserable
and worried as their reasons for absenteeism]{.underline}. Perez & Widom
(1994) asserted that child abuse represents a significant risk factor
for poor long-term intellectual and academic outcomes, e.g. lower IQ and
reading ability. [Findings of low IQ in traumatized children were also
described]{.underline} by Mannarino and Cohen (1986). In his book
'Scarred minds,' Somasundaram (1998) presented a list of psychosocial
problems in adolescents, sampled from six different schools and
colleagues across the war-affected North-Eastern educational zones of
Sri Lanka. Within that study, 28--65% of children reported loss of
memory, 33--60% loss of concentration, and 35--60% loss of motivation to
achieve in education. Besides psychometric testing for psychiatric
disorders, our group (Elbert et al., 2009) undertook cognitive and
memory tests in a sub-sample validation group of Tamil school children,
residing at the time in the LTTE-controlled areas of NorthEastern Sri
Lanka. This region had been affected by two decades of civil war at the
time of assessment in 2002. All traumatized children with a diagnosis of
PTSD 338 E. Schauer and T. Elbert in the sample reported lasting
interference of experiences with their daily life. The
neuropsychological testing and the investigation of school grades
validated mentalhealth outcomes further and accentuated some specific
cognitive problems that were associated with PTSD, especially the
deficiency in memory functions. In fact, the affected children's
performance decreased with the number of traumatic events experienced.
[The children's grades in school, when averaged separately for the two
groups and across disciplines, reflected that the problems in
functioning were mental in nature, with a focus on deficits in the
verbal abilities]{.underline}. [Employment possibilities are already
scarce in post-war societies, and researchers observe that [finding a
job is]{.mark} even more [difficult]{.mark} for
ex-combatants]{.underline} (Gear, 2002; Heinemann-Gruder, Pietz, &
Duffy, 2003). Mogapi (2004) reported from the South African DDR program
that [ex-combatants, who suffer from a trauma-spectrum disorder, have
clear-cut difficulties on the job, suffer increased [concentration

feelings of helplessness and thus [aggravates]{.mark} symptoms of
depression in [a **downward-spiral effect.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Child soldiers experience [depersonalization]{.underline}\-\--that eliminates their [value to life]{.underline} and outweighs typical violence

Donna **Sharkey** **12**, teaches in the School of Education at the
State University of New York and holds a Ph.D. from the University of
Ottawa, July-September 2012, "Picture the Child Soldier", Peace Review:
Volume 24, Issue 3, p. 262-267, ezc

It\'s in the eyes, vacant, chilling. A general sense of the lives of
child soldiers exists for most people in the West through ideas such as
these: young children who have been abducted, children who have killed
their parents, children who have been tortured, girls who have been
raped, eight-year-olds who have been used as mine sweeps, and those who
have gotten out of control because of drugs, gun powder, and alcohol.
This understanding exists in part through photographs depicting these
children, transmitting emotions, and anticipating an affective response
in us, the viewers. With images of child soldiers in the public domain,
the questions of how these images are seen, read, interpreted, and how
they evoke emotional responses are important as they relate to the
impact the images can have on the framing of the issue for the Western
public. As an entree into understanding how people read, respond to
images of child soldiers, interpret the lives of child soldiers through
photographs, and the potential effect that photographs of child soldiers
can have, I conducted interviews during which I showed selected photos
of child soldiers. [Individual [discussions were held]{.mark} with
twelve adults between the ages of thirty and sixty-six. All of these
participants were university educated, all of them lived in a
medium-sized, Canadian city, and each discussion took approximately one
hour. During the interviews, [I asked people to tell me what they saw
when they looked at]{.mark} the images, what they noticed in particular,
what emotions the images evoked, and what they thought about the
condition of the lives of these children]{.underline}. Three days
following each of these initial interviews, I re-contacted participants
to ask them to imagine how they would respond if their own child or a
child close to them were a child soldier. Second, I asked them what
issue and/or questions these images left them with. The photographs
selected for the interviews were in a glossy twelve-by-nine inch picture
book titled Child Soldiers, edited by Leora Kahn who is the founder of
the organization Proof: media for social justice, and published by
powerHouse Books. [Divided by country, this book contains mainly colored
[photos of child soldiers]{.mark} in Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Uganda, Liberia, Sierra
Leone, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma, Afghanistan, Palestine, and
Iraq.]{.underline} The book also contains an introduction by Luis
Moreno-Ocampo, former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court;
drawings made by child soldiers depicting armed conflict; several short
narratives describing the situation of specific child soldiers; brief
explanatory notes relating to affected countries; words of the song
\"Warchild\" by Emmanuel Jal, a former child soldier from Sudan; short
articles by Jo Becker, chairperson of the Coalition to Stop the Use of
Child Soldiers and children\'s rights advocacy director for Human Rights
Watch; Mike Wessells, professor of psychology at Columbia University;
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois; and Jimmie Briggs, author of Innocents
Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War. Thirty-four photojournalists
contributed their images of child soldiers to the creation of this book.
Although Kahn does not state the book\'s purpose, in her preface she
makes clear her position concerning the use of child soldiers in armed
conflict when she states, \"the figure of the child dressed and
outfitted for war is indeed a particularly modern obscenity.\" In
considering participants\' responses, I [divided the photographs in the
book into six separate types: individual pictures, which were generally
close-up shots; group pictures of child soldiers sitting and waiting;
child soldiers walking or marching in formation; child soldiers in the
back of trucks or vans; girl soldiers; and post-conflict images of
ex-child soldiers]{.underline}. Only one photo was of boys and girls
together and only a few were photos of a single girl or small group of
girls. One [photo was of boys who looked to be stoned and while two
photos showed children appearing to be threatening, no photo showed them
as ferocious perpetrators.]{.underline} Together, participants and I
went through and examined the pictures that I had highlighted to ensure
that the same photos were considered by all participants. We also
stopped at certain ones participants themselves selected, allowing them
to study in detail those photos that most intrigued them. [Overall, all
of [the participants responded to]{.mark} the [photos with]{.mark} a
mixture of [anger, sadness, and]{.mark} with comments about how
imagination-defying the lives of child soldiers must be, and with the
following words and [questions]{.mark} hanging in the air: Why? How can
this be? What can be done?]{.underline} What about the rest of the lives
of these kids? While participants noticed that [in most of the photos
the children were carrying weapons, and [all commented]{.mark} that
[**fun was absent** from]{.mark} the lives of [these
children]{.mark}]{.underline}, no one made links to issues such as
poverty, addictions, or physical or mental illness. No one discussed
child soldiers as perpetrators. In addition, none of the participants
expanded the conversation to the political context of child soldiery,
although almost all stated that the practice had to be stopped. I joined
the guerilla when I was ten years old. I wanted to serve in an armed
group; it appealed to me. After five years I withdrew I was
tired---very, very tired. ---Testimony of child soldier from Colombia
Reacting to the images of a single child, [participants generally
responded by saying one word followed after a pause by another
word]{.underline}. [[Words]{.mark} used [to express what participants
read in]{.mark} the [pictures]{.mark} and particularly focusing on the
child\'s expression [were: **misery, abject, lifeless,
deadened**]{.mark} **look, [vacant]{.mark} eyes**, it\'s in the eyes,
and such worry]{.underline}. A comment from one participant was that [if
these children could speak to the camera, they would only
cry]{.underline}. At times, people spent a few minutes on a specific
photo in this way. One image in particular attracted the attention of
participants. It was a close-up of cyanide capsules on a string around a
boy\'s neck. Beside the capsules on the string hung a small cross of
Jesus. I like rifles. Having a rifle gives me a good feeling. I just
love to hold them. When I had a rifle, I was in charge. I had a very
good time with my friends. Sometimes I think of returning. ---Testimony
of child soldier from Colombia [[When commenting on]{.mark} the [photos
of child soldiers]{.mark} sitting and waiting [in groups, participants
noticed]{.mark} the **[stooped postures]{.mark}** of children
[and]{.mark} their **[defeated body language]{.mark}**]{.underline},
their [[limited interaction]{.mark} with each other, a **[lack
of]{.mark} a sense of [determination]{.mark}**, and an **[absence of
passion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They stated that [the [children
appeared]{.mark} [devoid of emotion]{.mark}, expressionless. [They had
**no animation, no spark**]{.mark}. Participants [also]{.mark} noticed
**[deep sadness in]{.mark} the [children\'s eyes]{.mark}** []{.mark}and
their troubled expressions. In one photo of two boys, participants
interpreted the boys\' expressions as being brainwashed, yet
stoical]{.underline}. [More chilling than the weapon he held was what he
wore on this back; a pink teddy-bear backpack, a telling symbol of his
lost youth.]{.underline} ---Jimmie Briggs Reading [[the photos
of]{.mark} groups of [children walking]{.mark} or marching [in
formation]{.mark}, participants commented on [the children\'s frozen
expressions,]{.mark} their [raw sadness, and]{.mark} their
[frowns]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [[children]{.mark} were
intently paying attention while walking or marching and [seemed to be
numb and beaten]{.mark} down]{.underline}. As well, [several
participants said [they]{.mark} appeared to **[look like]{.mark} a group
of [ghosts]{.mark}** and seemed depleted in spirit. These [children
looked]{.mark} to participants [like automatons with dead faces]{.mark},
closed off from the world. They made us overpower a group of government
soldiers and take their weapons. Then we had to cut them up with pangas
\[machetes\]. The rebels told me that if I refused, they would kill me.
Another boy was chopped up as an example. So, I killed the three
government soldiers.]{.underline} [---Child soldier from Uganda as told
to Jimmie Briggs]{.underline} In the photos of children in the back of
trucks, [participants read fearless expressions and at times
bravado]{.underline}. They noted how the children appeared as though
they had no fear of dying or of killing, and how they looked as though
they would not hesitate to kill. They stated that [[the children seemed
as]{.mark} though [they had **lost their identities**]{.mark}**, were
[depersonalized]{.mark}**, and [had no sense of self]{.mark}, like **the
waking dead**. They had flat stares, yet looked anguished. [The children
looked]{.mark} at the camera [with vacant eyes]{.mark}, appearing
resigned to their situation. [It was **not possible to see**]{.mark}
**their [character or]{.mark} their
[personalities]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Rose was 10 years old when she
was abducted by the LRA on her way to visit her grandmother. She was
raped, beaten, and passed from one soldier to another. She gave birth to
her first child at the age of 15. After the baby was born, she felt
there was no way to escape. ---Profile of a girl child soldier from
Uganda [The images of girls tended to be the most problematic for
participants. They often commented on the thicker layers of difficulty,
pain, and complexity girls must face]{.underline}. One participant said,
\"When I see the girls, it throws me off because we\'re so used to
seeing images of boys as soldiers. This confuses me. This girl is in a
male environment. How much more difficult that must be.\" [Participants
noted deep sadness in the girls\' eyes, looks of depletion, and most of
all, their wary expressions.]{.underline} I have nightmares. I feel as
if somebody is scolding me harshly and threatening me, so I get
petrified from time to time. ---Testimony of girl child soldier from
Nepal [A few of the images were of [ex-child soldiers]{.mark} following
armed conflict. Although these images displayed children in such
contexts as playing sports or learning a trade, participants interpreted
the children in the images as [appear]{.mark}ing **[defeated and
exhausted]{.mark}**. In one image of an ex-girl soldier with two of her
three children following war, she appeared to participants to **not have
adequate strength, energy, or life force** to take care of her
children.]{.underline} In another image of several boys in a prison,
participants noted that this photo seemed to be an anomaly as it was the
only one in which boys had a look of defiance and anger on their faces.

#### The US already has a law that bans weapons sales to countries with child soldiers\-\--the Child Soldiers Prevention Act or CSPA\-\--but the act contains a provision that allows the President to waive prohibitions to offending governments so they can receive US weapons\-\--in 2018, Trump waived 97% of assistance that should have been prohibited 

Rachel **Stohl**, 10-24-20**18**, managing director at the Stimson
Center, Shannon Dick, research associate with the Conventional Defense
Program, The Trump Administration is Failing to Stop the Use of Child
Soldiers, National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-administration-failing-stop-use-child-soldiers-34242

In what is becoming a yearly disappointment, [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration again [missed a **key opportunity** to]{.mark} encourage
foreign governments to [stop]{.mark} recruiting and using [child
soldiers]{.mark}. Late last month when President Donald [Trump]{.mark}
released his determinations with respect to the Child Soldiers
Prevention Act (CSPA) of 2008, he [declared]{.mark} that it [is in the
national interest]{.mark} of the United States [to provide]{.mark} U.S.
[military assistance to seven countries known to]{.mark}
recruit/[use]{.mark}---or support the recruitment/use of---[children in
armed conflict]{.mark}. In so doing, the Trump administration chose to
overlook notable human-rights concerns and undermine U.S. efforts to
prevent the use of child soldiers.]{.underline}

Ten years ago, [Congress passed **[the CSPA]{.mark}** with the
**[goal]{.mark}** of **[leveraging U.S. arms transfers]{.mark}** and
military assistance **[to dissuade foreign governments from]{.mark}
recruiting and [using children in]{.mark} their national
[militaries]{.mark}** or government-sponsored armed groups]{.underline}.
The CSPA requires the secretary of state to identify countries that
recruit and use child soldiers. [Once [listed]{.mark}, those
[governments are prohibited from receiving]{.mark} seven specific
categories of U.S. military assistance]{.underline} provided by the
Departments of State and Defense. [These programs]{.underline} are often
the most coveted by foreign governments and [include:
**[d]{.mark}**irect **[c]{.mark}**ommercial **[s]{.mark}**ales, excess
defense articles, foreign military financing, **[f]{.mark}**oreign
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[s]{.mark}**ales, international military and
education training assistance (IMET), peacekeeping operations assistance
(PKO) and Section 1206 assistance]{.underline}.

[In June 2018, the State Department identified eleven countries as
violators under the CSPA: Burma (Myanmar), the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), Iran, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan,
Syria and Yemen. While under the law these countries are technically
prohibited from receiving U.S. military assistance in fiscal year (FY)
2019, **[the president can waive]{.mark} the CSPA's
[prohibitions]{.mark} and allow these identified governments to remain
eligible to receive U.S. weapons and military assistance.**]{.underline}

Do You Know What Happened Today In History?

The 2018 list is the second opportunity the Trump administration has had
to demonstrate its commitment to stopping the use of child soldiers. [In
2017, the list omitted notorious violators Afghanistan, Iraq and Myanmar
and was seen as a political statement demonstrating the lack of
importance the Trump administration placed on stopping this horrific
practice. Although the 2018 list was more comprehensive in scope, **the
[Trump]{.mark} administration['s]{.mark} application of the
[waivers]{.mark} has [made a mockery of the CSPA
list.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In its release of the presidential waivers last week, the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [announced]{.mark} that it was
[waiving]{.mark} CSPA [prohibitions for]{.mark} seven of the eleven
governments identified on the State Department's child soldiers list,
thereby allowing all the military assistance requested by the U.S.
government to [**Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and
Yemen** to proceed, despite]{.mark} their records of using or supporting
[the use of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yemen, however, is
currently not slated to receive any CSPA-relevant military assistance in
FY 19.

Only seven of the eleven countries identified on this year's CSPA list
are slated to receive U.S. military assistance in fiscal year 2019: the
DRC, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan. Therefore,
with the Trump administration's recent determination, six of these seven
countries will not be affected by the CSPA's prohibitions. Iraq will
remain eligible to receive \$1 million in IMET, Mali and Niger will both
remain eligible to receive \$700,000 in IMET, Nigeria remains eligible
to receive \$800,000 in IMET, Somalia remains eligible to receive
\$225,000 in IMET and \$95 million in PKO assistance, and South Sudan
remains eligible to receive over \$24 million in PKO assistance. [No
waivers were provided for Burma, the DRC, Iran or Syria. However, no
assistance has thus far been requested under the CSPA programs for
Burma, Iran or Syria, meaning the CSPA will have no real impact on those
countries]{.underline}. All told, [**the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[waived]{.mark} more than [97 percent of]{.mark} otherwise prohibited
[assistance]{.mark}** [to countries with]{.mark} known [child soldier
abuses]{.mark}, allowing \$123 million in U.S. military assistance to
continue to flow to these governments.]{.underline}

[The only government facing any consequences from its continued use and
recruitment of child soldiers is the DRC. The DRC had been slated to
receive funds through IMET and PKO, but it is now ineligible to receive
this assistance because it did not receive a waiver from the Trump
administration]{.underline}. That means that DRC will miss out on
\$375,000 in IMET and more than \$2 million in PKO assistance due to
their continued use of child soldiers.

One government out of eleven. Or, put another way, [an implementation
rate of less than 10 percent [for a law]{.mark} that the U.S. government
has traditionally [held up as a **key instrument** for combating human
trafficking]{.mark} in the form of child soldiers. Governments choosing
to abuse their most vulnerable populations can continue to do so without
being held accountable. The [Trump]{.mark} administration continues to
[send the **wrong message** and fails to emphasize]{.mark} that
[abuse]{.mark} of children [will not be tolerated]{.mark}. Instead, the
Trump administration is actively ignoring the plight of affected
children around the world and [demonstrating that]{.mark} its
**[assurances to protect children ring hollow]{.mark}**. The CSPA's
drafters intended the waivers to be used judiciously to address
national-security needs. However, the Trump administration is instead
using the waivers to continue arming perpetual violators of the
law]{.underline}. Children exploited by parties to armed conflict
deserve better.

#### Fully enforcing the CSPA makes the threat of ending arms sales credible and is key to ending the use of child soldiers\-\--waivers prevent the US from sending a strong, clear signal opposing the practice\-\--US action spurs global momentum and influences governments to promote democratic norms

Impact of Arms Transfers

**[[The global arms trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- in its legitimate
and illegitimate forms -- [**[continues to fuel]{.mark} the [recruitment
of child soldiers]{.mark}** around the world.]{.underline} Indeed, [the
dynamics of this trade have made weapons more accessible to more actors,
and [despite]{.mark} the [efforts of the international community]{.mark}
to limit the flow of weapons to parties complicit in violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law, both legal and illicit
arms transfers continue to be made to human rights abusing governments
and nefarious rebel groups]{.underline}. Many of these actors forcibly
recruit children to undertake menial tasks or to serve as combatants.
[For years, civil society, national governments, and international
organizations have recognized the links between arms transfers and the
unlawful recruitment or use of children in armed conflict, and called
upon states to abolish and criminalize arms transfers to state and
non-state actors that have records of recruiting and using children in
armed conflict. Yet, **[few countries have actually taken steps to
limit]{.mark} transfers of [weapons]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} could
[facilitate]{.mark} the use of [children in]{.mark} armed
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, many countries with a proven
track record of recruiting child soldiers rely on weapons and military
assistance from some of the world's leading arms exporters.

China, for example, has exported millions of dollars in small arms and
light weapons to South Sudan, where child soldier recruitment is rampant
with more than 10,000 children believed to be fighting in government and
rebel armies. Similarly, Germany and France -- both among the top five
weapons exporters in the world -- have exported arms to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the national army and various rebel
groups are known to forcibly recruit child soldiers. And the United
States, the world's largest arms exporter, has consistently provided
weapons and military assistance to Yemen to be used in counterterrorism
operations, despite widespread international condemnation for its use of
child soldiers.

The U.S. Response

[**[The U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[is one of the few
countries to have taken steps]{.mark}** to condition the provision of
military assistance based upon on a country's record of child soldier
use. [Through the]{.mark} Child Soldiers Prevention Act
(**[CSPA]{.mark}**), [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates implemented
national legislation to [prohibit arms transfers]{.mark} and military
training [to countries identified]{.mark} by the State Department as
[having]{.mark} recruited and [used child soldiers]{.mark} in national
militaries or government-supported armed groups]{.underline}. In
addition, [[the Act incentivizes U.S. military assistance by encouraging
governments]{.mark} that use child soldiers [to end the]{.mark}
internationally condemned [practice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Though the CSPA does not provide complete prohibition against all U.S.
military assistance, it does limit foreign military sales, direct
commercial sales, excess defense articles, international military
education and training, foreign military financing, and some
peacekeeping operations assistance -- which represent the largest U.S.
arms sales and military assistance programs. Under the Act, governments
can receive otherwise prohibited assistance to professionalize their
militaries if the U.S. president certifies that the country is taking
reasonable steps to demobilize child soldiers as well as providing
rehabilitation and reintegration assistance. Certification can lead to
the waiving of the CPSA's restrictions and result in the provision of
military education, training, and nonlethal supplies.

[**[Although a potentially powerful tool, the U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates **[has not]{.mark} consistently [leveraged the Act's
utility to send a strong and clear message]{.mark} against the use of
child soldiers. [Instead, Washington has invoked the Act's waiver
authority]{.mark} more often than not to provide full and partial
waivers to countries with known records of child soldier
use**]{.underline}. For example, between 2012 and 2014, the State
Department identified the DRC, South Sudan, and Yemen as having
recruited and used children in armed conflict. However, the
administration has consistently provided waivers to the prohibitions
warranted by the CSPA that would otherwise limit U.S. military
assistance to these countries.

In some cases, these waivers amount to millions of dollars in military
assistance. This year, Somalia might receive upwards of \$115 million in
sanctionable assistance that would otherwise be prohibited by the CSPA.
Yemen could have access to at least \$26 million that would also be
prohibited under the terms of the Act. These provisions of assistance
stand in contrast to conditions on the ground, where child recruitment
by government-supported armed groups in Yemen has increased and 200
children are believed to have been recruited by the Somali national army
and allied militias in 2013 alone.

Grounds for Optimism?

[**[In other parts of the world, explicit action like the CSPA is even
rarer]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Belgium, for example, has legislation that
prohibits the export and transit of arms to countries that use child
soldiers in their national armies. However, [[most states have yet to
develop regulations]{.mark} that respond to the established connection
[between arms transfers and the use of child
soldiers]{.mark}.]{.underline} The new Arms Trade Treaty might be one
vehicle that governments can use to fill that void. Because children are
at risk of being recruited and used by government forces,
paramilitaries, and other armed groups, efforts to condition arms
transfers must be broader in scope.

[**[Globally, measures like the CSPA could be used to]{.mark}** mitigate
and ultimately **[end the use of child soldiers]{.mark}** in national
militaries and government-supported armed groups. It]{.underline}, along
with similar measures, [should be considered within a larger,
coordinated context to support sustainable institutions and security
apparatuses in emerging democracies. The implementation of arms and
assistance prohibitions should complement democracy promotion and
security sector reform. [Prohibitions]{.mark} can and [should be
**linked to**]{.mark} the signing and implementation of
**[national]{.mark}** action [**plans** focused on]{.mark} demobilizing
and [ending recruitment of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
short, [these [measures can be used to **encourage changes in government
behavior** and]{.mark} to **[promote democratic norms within the
military]{.mark}** structure that do not rely on the use of child
soldiers.]{.underline}

#### States are responsible for child soldiers in armed groups\-\--they should be required to acknowledge the issue and take measures to prevent HR violations 

Lucia **Withers et al 13-** Amnesty International London, Consultant and
Senior Researcher at Child Soldiers International (CSI) et al Published

soldiers" Child Soldiers International,

The [Optional Protocol covers all types of military forces: state armed
forces, non- state armed groups allied to states and non-state armed
opposition groups that are independent of any state]{.underline}
involvement. Articles 1 to 3 refer to national armies and other legally
established or officially constituted state armed forces. Armed groups
"that are distinct from the armed forces of a State" are covered by
Article 4 of the Optional Protocol. As has been noted elsewhere, a
government can declare a group either to be part of the armed forces of
the state or as not being part of them. There is no third option: all
are covered and either way the Protocol confers obligations on states.7

The wording of Article 4 was left intentionally vague to cover a broad
rangebof armed groups. However, the fact that [states have
responsibility to prevent recruitment by armed groups]{.underline}
[covered by this provision is clear. **Specifically, [states are
required to "take all feasible measures to prevent" recruitment and use
of children]{.mark}** [by such groups]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What constitutes "[feasible measures" depends on the type of
relationship between the state and the armed groups.]{.underline}
Although states may have limited capacity to influence the practice of
armed groups against which they are fighting, when the armed groups are
allied to them there will be at least some level of influence over such
groups and their actions[: [the stronger the level of control]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [state over these groups]{.mark}, the [more extensive
the measures the government]{.mark} can, [and is required to, take to
comply with its obligations]{.mark} under Article 4.]{.underline}

Under international law, a state's responsibility may be engaged in
three different ways:

Firstly, [where an armed group is acting]{.underline} on instruction or
under the direction or control of a state, [[even when]{.mark} the
[group does not have a legal basis and is not officially
recognised]{.mark} by the state]{.underline}, its members are de facto
state officials **[and [the state is directly responsible for their
acts]{.mark}]{.underline}**.8

Secondly, [even when a state does not exercise effective or overall
control over armed groups]{.underline} with which it is allied, **[[it
may still be]{.mark} [directly responsible for human rights violations
committed by state officials in support of]{.mark} these [armed
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Such would be the
case]{.mark},]{.underline} for example[[, if]{.mark} the [armed
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} or other state officials assist or [[are
complicit in]{.mark} the [recruitment]{.mark} and use [of children by
state-allied armed groups]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

State officials' support for the commission of crimes by allied armed
groups, such as unlawful recruitment and use of children, may also carry
individual criminal responsibility. In May 2012, for example, the
Special Court for Sierra Leone found Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and
abetting the commission of crimes committed by armed groups active
during the armed conflict in Sierra Leone. The former President of
Liberia was found to have provided arms, ammunition, operational support
and encouragement which contributed substantially to the commission of
crimes by these armed groups, including conscripting or enlisting
children under the age of 15 years or using them to participate actively
in hostilities.9

Thirdly, and [more broadly]{.underline}[, [under human rights and
international humanitarian law, states have an obligation to protect
individuals from abuses]{.underline}]{.mark} committed by non- state
armed groups.10 The triggering of this obligation does not require proof
of any sort of state support to the armed groups: the state has a
stand-alone obligation to act with due diligence to protect individuals
from human rights abuses. [The [state clearly fails]{.mark} to fulfil
this obligation [if,]{.mark} instead of taking measures to protect
children]{.underline} from being recruited and used by armed groups,
**[[it turns a blind eye and supports]{.mark} [these groups with
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** or in other ways.

#### Risk for future child soldier use exists even if present conflict ends\-\--legal ambiguity means factors that allow initial recruitment remains

The [[risk to children of recruitment]{.mark} and use in armed
conflict]{.underline}, while often only apparent once a conflict is in
full swing, [[can continue after]{.mark} [the end of hostilities
unless]{.mark} practical [measures are taken to
address]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[legal and institutional
shortcomings]{.mark} which allowed children to be recruited]{.underline}
by the armed forces [in the first instance.]{.underline}

In the last decade a number of armed conflicts in which children are
known to have been used by state armed forces have drawn to a close. [As
hostilities have ceased, large numbers of children have been released
from fighting]{.underline} forces in the context of broader disarmament,
demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) initiatives[. However, [unless
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}, the **[[problems]{.mark} which
[facilitated underage recruitment and use during the conflict will
remain, making the future re-emergence of]{.mark} the [practice
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[In Chad]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, where [[child soldiers were
extensively used by parties to armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}
including the Chadian National Army (Armée nationale tchadienne, ANT),
[[there was]{.mark} a marked [decrease in incidents]{.mark} of underage
recruitment [after 2009]{.mark}]{.underline}. While encouraging, the
trend is attributable in large part to improvements in the security
situation and normalisation of relations between Chad and Sudan.6 In the
meantime, [factors which contributed to unlawful child
recruitment]{.underline} and hence use -- [namely a residual legal
ambiguity in relation to the minimum age]{.underline} of recruitment;
informal and [often corrupt recruitment practices; absence of both the
means to determine and processes to verify the age of new recruits; and
lack of oversight and accountability -- remain in place]{.underline}.

Improved security in Chad provides the most promising opportunity in
years to address the question of how it is that children come to be
associated with the ANT and to begin to close the routes through which
this can happen. [[Preventing future underage recruitment
i]{.mark}s,]{.underline} however, [[dependent on]{.mark} military and
associated [reform]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is to some extent
reflected in the "Action Plan" for the cessation of child soldier
recruitment and use by the ANT and associated forces agreed by the
government of Chad and the UN in June 2011. In addition to commitments
to release and reintegrate any children in ANT ranks, the plan includes
agreement to put in place effective age verification mechanisms and, in
support of this, to strengthen the national birth registration system.
It also addresses the need for accountability through commitments to
criminalise recruitment and use of children in national law and to
promptly investigate and prosecute individuals for non- compliance.7

[[Achieving this]{.mark}]{.underline} and other elements of the plan,
though[, [is dependent on political will]{.mark} and the commitment of
resources [by the government]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which is not a
given]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[It will also require international
engagement including support for security sector
reform]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a period extending to several years at
least. It is not clear, however, that this support will be forthcoming.
Within months of the action plan being agreed other priorities had taken
over and it was apparent that the UN Country Team did not have
sufficient financial or logistical capacity to support its full
implementation or to reliably assess whether the proposed measures had
been successful in bringing about the release of all children in ANT
ranks and in ending further recruitment. In the meantime, the limited
program of military reform currently under way in [[Chad does not
address the prevention of recruitment]{.mark} and use of child
soldiers]{.underline} (see section 5.3).8 In this context,
[[C]{.mark}hild [S]{.mark}oldiers [I]{.mark}nternational [was]{.mark}
concerned, but [not surprised, to learn]{.mark} that [new cases of
unlawful recruitment]{.mark} of children [occurred in
2012]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}9

The case of [[Côte d'Ivoire demonstrates the dangers of ignoring]{.mark}
the importance of]{.underline} longer-term support for [[structural
reform]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here child recruitment and use was
pervasive during the 2002--3 armed conflict and in the political unrest
that followed. Many [[hundreds of children were released]{.mark} from
fighting forces [following]{.mark} the [end of active
hostilities]{.mark}. [However, little progress was made in addressing
factors]{.mark}]{.underline} which had previously facilitated child
soldier recruitment and use, with the result that children became
involved in renewed hostilities when political violence broke out in
2010.

Although child recruitment and use by Côte d'Ivoire's armed forces was
assessed by the UN to have ended by 2006, and by armed groups affiliated
to the government by 2007,10 [there were indications that the government
was not fully committed to following through]{.underline} [with
measures]{.underline} that were needed [to protect children from future
recruitment]{.underline} or use. Among these was the government's
failure to act on a commitment made in 2006 to the UN Security Council
Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict (SCWG) to ratify the
Optional Protocol "as soon as possible".11 The government also ignored
recommendations of the UN Secretary-General and the SCWG to initiate
rigorous and timely investigations and prosecutions of perpetrators of
crimes against children.12 Finally, and perhaps most significantly, [the
[network of pro-government youth militias which proliferated following
the 2002 crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} and [which were reported to have
child soldiers]{.underline} in their ranks were [[never
dismantled]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Chapter 4).13

[[When]{.mark} political [violence broke out]{.mark}]{.underline}
following the refusal of the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, to
concede defeat following an election run-off in November 2010,
**[[children were once again mobilised]{.mark} by forces [on both
sides]{.mark}]{.underline}**.14 These included the state armed forces
and armed groups that remained loyal to former President Gbagbo, and
forces loyal to the president-elect, Alassane Ouattara.

The end of hostilities and return to relative normalcy, if not full
security, in Côte d'Ivoire provide another chance to tackle underlying
problems which made likely, if not inevitable, children's participation
in the latest armed conflict. The country's accession to the Optional
Protocol in March 2012 is a promising sign, as is the reported release
of children associated with fighting forces.15 However, to minimise the
possibility of children once again becoming involved in any future
hostilities, [[international engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} and support
[[should continue until all provisions]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
Optional Protocol [[are]{.mark} fully
[implemented]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As is the case with Chad[,
this is necessarily a long-term exercise involving profound reform of
the military as well as efforts]{.underline} [towards
strengthening]{.underline} broader [legal and institutional protections
for children against future recruitment]{.underline} and use as
soldiers.

Virginia **Gamba 18**, Special Representative of the Secretary-General
for Children and Armed Conflict in Office of the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG/CAAC),
Nov 18, 2018, Building Peace: Protecting Children in Conflict,
https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/building-peace-protecting-children-in-conflict/

"[The protection of children is a topic of universal resonance for all
of us]{.underline}," highlighted the Director-General of UN Office in
Geneva, Michael Møller, as he kick started Geneva Peace Week 2018 with
the event Building Peace: Protecting Children in Conflict on 4 November
2018. "This type of event is exactly why we started Geneva Peace Week,
here in the City of Peace, where we bring together the richness of
different actors for frank discussions on challenging, but pressing
realities," he said.

The event, organized by the Office of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General (SRSG) for Children and Armed Conflict (CAAC) and
co-sponsored by the Permanent Representations of Belgium and Uruguay to
the UN, highlighted that [[ending and preventing violations against
children in armed conflict is]{.mark} not only [a **moral
imperative**]{.mark} but can [also contribute]{.mark}d [to building
**sustainable peace**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The event also contributed
to building support for the Special Representative's strategic focus on
prevention and presented ways in which Member States, civil society and
others contribute to building peace through the implementation of the
CAAC agenda and related prevention initiatives.

"What binds New York and Geneva together is the agenda of prevention,
which is the very topic of our side-event. We'll indeed discuss today
how [we can build sustainable peace in ending and preventing violations
and violence against children in armed conflict. Children, who represent
roughly half of the world's population affected by conflict, largely
remain invisible victims]{.underline}," emphasized the Permanent
Representative of Belgium to the United Nations in Geneva, H.E. Amb.
Geert Muylle, in his opening remarks.

"[[Ending violations against children in times of war]{.mark} is the
primary focus]{.underline} of my work. [But we do not stop there.
**Preventing** **violations** -- and therefore contributing to building
peace -- [is our **ultimate goal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," emphasized the
SRSG for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba. The mandate of the
Special Representative has been given stronger tools to prevent
violations against children affected by conflict through the adoption in
July 2018 of Security Council Resolution 2427. Reaffirming the important
role the Special Representative can play in contributing to conflict
prevention, the resolution calls upon States and the United Nations to
mainstream child protection into conflict prevention activities and
conflict and post-conflict situations with the aim of sustaining peace
and preventing conflict.

"The war took everything: my family, my friends, my childhood." Messeh
Leone, advocate for children affected by war

Messeh Leone experienced war at a very young age in his country, Sierra
Leone. "But I've been among the lucky ones," said the young man who now
lives in the United Kingdom and advocates for children affected by war.
"[[Society]{.mark} generally [doesn't]{.mark} really want to [listen to
children, their voices]{.mark} are easily **[discarded]{.mark}**. That's
why education is important. [Children need to be guided and
protected]{.mark} to be able to bring their voice to the
table]{.underline}," he said, emphasizing the global responsibility to
protect children from war.

World Vision Representative Erica Hall highlighted the importance of a
collaborative approach to better protect children and building peace.
"[[If we want sustainable peace, it won't happen without
children]{.underline}]{.mark}," she raised. "We know that protecting and
empowering children requires coordination and collaboration at all
levels -- from the community up to global level. We can't do it alone --
no one can. We must all play our part," she added.

"In the Central African Republic (CAR), about 70% of the country is
controlled by armed groups," highlighted Nathalie Ben Zakour Man, Senior
Child Protection Advisor for the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in
CAR (MINUSCA). "It is crucial to constantly talking to the armed groups,
maintaining the dialogue and keeping the communication lines open."
Thanks to this ongoing dialogue and strong advocacy on the ground and at
different levels, 11,429 children (30% girls) have been separated from
the armed groups in the Central African Republic since 2014.

UNICEF Representative Jean-François Basse underlined the importance of
changing the way we talk about protecting children in armed conflict by
focusing not only on the recruitment and use of children, but on all six
grave violations and on reintegration. "Releasing children is important
but the reintegration of children is equally important," he plead.

Ezequiel Heffes from Geneva Call, an organization working closely with
armed non-State actors to promote respect for international humanitarian
norms in armed conflict, reminded that the engagement on child
protection issues should be ongoing and not only during active conflict.
"Engagement should continue beyond the conflict, in negotiating peace
agreements, for example," he said.

A point echoed by the Permanent Representative of Uruguay to the UN in
Geneva, H.E. Amb. Ricardo González Arenas, in his closing remarks.
"Child protection must be part of any comprehensive strategy aimed at
preventing and resolving conflicts with a view to sustainable peace.
That is why child protection issues should be included in peace
processes from its very early stages, duly taking into account the best
interest of the child," he said.

#### Protecting children should be an imperative of international peace

Tonderai W. **Chikuhwa 12**, in New York as senior program officer in
the United Nations Office for Children and Armed Conflict. He advocates
Security Council for stronger protection measures for children, and is
working to implement a global mechanism to monitor and report on grave
child rights violations in these and other conflict zones - From UN,
5/31/12 Protecting Children in Armed Conflicts as a New Imperative of
International Peace and Security,
<https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1520&context=macintl>
page 52-53 Gabe

Chikuhwa affirms that, "[[**protecting children** in armed conflicts
is]{.mark} a new [**imperative** of international **peace and
security**]{.mark}."]{.underline} He suggests that [[protecting the
child exceeds the duty towards the vulnerable populations in a
society]{.mark}, but is an imperative for global peace and
security.]{.underline} If the [[**protection** of **children** is an
**end in itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}, without reducing it to a means,
[[this end in itself generates another end]{.underline}]{.mark} that [is
[world peace and global security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Tonderai Chikuhwa's presentation, first of all, inscribes the
[[**protection** of the **child** within the **deontological ethics**
that emerge through the **notion** of the
**"imperative**]{.mark}.]{.underline}" But at the same time, [if the
protection of the child is not realized as a goal, we will not have
international security.]{.underline} Thus, a child rights that is linked
to the context of the family and the nation finds itself in an
international world. We should recall that the implication of the United
Nations in the protection of the child has moved the notion of human
rights from a pious wish, from a simple declaration of Human Rights, to
the domain of international law. It is worth appreciating as well the
creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC), according to the
Rome statute. Military operations of the United Nations are no longer on
the wishful level of overseeing a ceasefire and putting themselves
between two belligerent parties. [United Nations soldiers no longer
hesitate to engage in combat in order to protect civilian lives. If a
"strategic peacekeeping operation" is justified by its goal of
protecting human rights, then peace and national security become the
stakes of military intervention.]{.underline} As Chikuhwa points out so
well, "[the Security Council and the United Nations system as a whole
recognize that the grave violations being perpetrated against children
in the context of war constitute a legitimate threat to the maintenance
of international peace and security."]{.underline} It appears, then,
[that the [protection of the child in armed conflicts]{.mark} has become
[one of the basic rights,]{.mark} which means [it is an essential path
to enjoying international peace and security]{.mark}.]{.underline} 1
This shift in the United Nations mandate therefore involves moral and
legal considerations.

Tonderai Chikuhwa emphasizes the United Nations' engagement along four
axes: • The changing character of modern warfare and critical child
protection themes; • Locating children on the United Nations peace and
security agenda; • Children and armed conflict as an operational
priority of the Secretary-General and the United Nations Secretariat; •
and, finally, progress in the protection of children.

[War increasingly occurs inside of states.]{.underline} Such a war leads
to a gray zone between spaces of living, or safe zones, and spaces of
combat. Chikuhwa reminds us that, "new tactics of war, the absence of
clear composition, motivations and character, are complicated matters."
It follows that [such a context does nothing to protect a civilian or a
child in a "safe" area]{.underline}. This form of total war shakes the
core of international humanitarian law, which is based on the
distinction between combatants and civilians, as well as the principle
of proportionality in the use of force. [We observe that [**terrorism**,
and paradoxically the **war on terrorism**, does **not spare
children**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I will return shortly to the question
of children in detention.

The response of the United Nations on the protection of the child has
taken several faces and has engaged the United Nations through nearly
all of its structures[. [The protection of the child constitutes an
essential element of world peace]{.mark}]{.underline} insofar as it
engages the capacities and structures of the Security Council. One of
the consequences has been eight Security Council resolutions, as well as
other measures, such as the entrance of the child within the mandate of
peacekeeping operations. We should note as well that the work of
monitoring, reporting, and regime compliance can lead to legal sanctions
through the International Criminal Court for any act relating to, as
outlined by Chikuhwa, the "Killing or maiming of children, recruiting or
using child soldiers, attacks on schools or hospitals, rape or other
grave sexual violence against children, abduction of children, and
denial of humanitarian access for children."

Finally, in what he calls "progress in the protection of children,"
Chikuhwa emphasizes the importance of the ICC institution after the Rome
agreement and other international legal systems. The arrest of people
accused of using child soldiers is an act that can put an end to the
cycle of impunity. The cases presented here are those of Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo, Charles Taylor, the Côte d\'Ivoire, and the Sudan. Please note
that Charles Taylor is being prosecuted by the Special Court for Sierra
Leone (and Milosovic was prosecuted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia)

#### Recurrence of conflicts are more likely due to child soldiering -- [economic instabilities]{.underline} make recruitment easier, [PTSD]{.underline} and [aggression]{.underline} increase post-conflict instability

Roos **Haer 15**, assistant professor of International Relations at
Leiden university, et al. 5/11/15, "Child soldiers as time bombs?
Adolescents' participation in rebel groups and the recurrence of armed
conflict," https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066115581910

First, compared to children who have not been recruited by rebel groups,
[former [child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} are more likely to
[[experience economic disadvantages due to]{.mark} a [lack of
education]{.mark} after a conflict has ceased.]{.underline} The
[[resulting]{.mark} economic [weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} in
post-conflict states [[may then motivate the recurrence of
fighting.]{.underline}]{.mark} This argument belongs to the willingness
cluster of the theoretical framework on conflict recurrence, but also
includes elements of opportunity as former child soldiers already have
the skills for and are 'acquainted with' violent conflict. Brett and
McCallin (1998: 134), for instance, suggest that [former child
soldiers]{.underline} often [find themselves alienated from the
traditional means of livelihood as they never had the opportunity to
obtain the skills that underpin the economic bases of their communities
once they lay down weapons.]{.underline} Consequently, economic issues
due to a lack of education weigh especially heavily on former child
soldiers (Wessells, 2006: 202).3 Similarly, Blattman and Annan (2010)
show that rebels' [child soldier recruitment in Uganda had a negative
impact on former child soldiers]{.underline}' (post-conflict) education
and earnings [due to the lack of civilian schooling.]{.underline}4
According to these scholars, this education deficit impedes
labour-market success: while former child soldiers are just as likely to
be employed, they are half as likely to be engaged in skilled work, and
they earn wages that are lower by a third. The fact that former child
soldiers in particular suffer economically is also confirmed by research
on the challenges that former child soldiers faced in Mozambique and El
Salvador (e.g. Boothby et al., 2006; Santacruz and Arana, 2002).

In other words, [[former child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[have
no skills]{.mark} other than killing and being able to fieldstrip
weapons]{.underline} (Singer, 2006: 111), [and future life prospects are
dimmed for them in the wider region.]{.underline}
[[This]{.mark}]{.underline} may significantly [[raise the
willingness]{.mark} of former child soldiers [to start fighting again
since]{.mark} recruitment costs are reduced]{.underline} (from the
perspective of the rebel group) [and [rejoining]{.mark}]{.underline} a
rebel group might [[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} at least [[access to
basic necessities and supplies]{.mark},]{.underline} such as food,
shelter and so on, [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps even [a higher
[income]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Barnitz, 1997; Honwana, 2006;
Wessells, 2010). A Liberian child soldier, for example, told Human
Rights Watch (2004, quoted in Wessells, 2006: 168):

\[f\]or a while, I did some small jobs around Monrovia, but there was
not much to do and I could not afford to go back to school. So two years
ago, I decided to join the Liberians United for Reconciliation and
Democracy (LURD). I figured I was better to fight and try to get
something, than hang around town doing nothing.

As such, rejoining rebel groups might be the only viable outside option
that former child soldiers have in post-conflict societies.

Second, and reinforced, in fact, by the preceding argumentation on
economic and educational disadvantages, [child]{.underline} soldiering
might cause [psychological harm]{.underline} in a way that [can have
severely negative consequences for post-conflict stability]{.underline}
(Freud and Burlingham, 1943; Masten and Nyaran, 2012). Typically, former
[child combatants have undergone and]{.underline}/or [carried out
shocking and disturbing violent actions]{.underline} (Barnitz, 1997;
Machel, 1996). Due to the fact that they are young, [the
effect]{.underline} of these events [on children's psyches is magnified
as they occur]{.underline} during a period [when personalities are being
formed and]{.underline} in which [the brain and its functions are still
in development. Traumatic experiences in these]{.underline} sensitive
[periods]{.underline} might [have an especially negative impact on
development]{.underline}, either [because the child is particularly
responsive at that time]{.underline} or because the brain is becoming
'programmed', that is, it adapts to the new information and will
subsequently filter all new information on the basis of these changes
(Masten and Narayan, 2012; Perry, 1997). Perry et al. (1995: 290)
formulate it even more strongly: 'experiences can change the nature of
the brain, but experiences during critical periods of early childhood
organize brain systems'.

[[Due to]{.underline}]{.mark} children's
[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or lack of coping mechanisms,
these [[traumatic events]{.mark}]{.underline} might
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[in]{.mark} affective
blindness or]{.underline} in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
([[PTSD]{.underline}]{.mark}) (Perry, 1997).5 PTSD is a psychiatric
disorder that was first associated with battle fatigue among soldiers
during the First and Second World Wars. [It may lead to both
[physical]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. severe headaches, stomach pain,
sleep disorders) [[and mental symptoms]{.underline}]{.mark} (depression,
anxiety, high levels of aggression, extreme pessimism or a limited
capacity to accept frustration), [[which]{.mark}]{.underline}
particularly [[impair]{.mark} former child soldiers' [ability to
function]{.mark}]{.underline} in [day-to-day]{.underline} living, as
compared with adults and children who have not been recruited by armed
groups (see also Singer, 2006: 194).6 In other words, traumatic
experiences during childhood increase the risk of developing a variety
of neuropsychiatric symptoms in adolescence and adulthood (see Perry et
al., 1995). Perry (1997) and Masten and Narayan (2012) provide good
overviews of how traumatic events influence neurological development and
how these experiences influence the subsequent emotional, behavioural,
cognitive and social functioning of children.

[One]{.underline} of the most worrying [symptom]{.underline}s [connected
to [children's war participation]{.mark} is]{.underline} a supposed
[[increase]{.mark} in]{.underline} their level of
[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, as compared with adults and children
who have not fought for an armed group, once a conflict has ceased (see
Cohn and Goodwin-Gill, 1994). Within armed groups, [[child
soldiers]{.mark} are especially susceptible to [learn]{.mark}ing
[aggressive behaviour by observing and imitating
others]{.mark}]{.underline} (Berkowitz, 1993; Schauer and Elbert, 2010;
Singer, 2006: 193f). As Dickson-Gómez (2002: 350) states: '[these
children are constantly surrounded by extreme levels of violence, that
violence therefore becomes normalized']{.underline}. As a result of this
normalization of violence, [former [child soldiers often resolve
conflicts violently in a post-conflict environment]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Schauer and Elbert, 2010: 335). Magambo and Lett (2004), for instance,
report that [former child soldiers in Northern Uganda applied physical
violence to resolve conflicts and that they were not able to think of
any non-violent alternatives, reflecting an absence of adequate social
skills.]{.underline} These necessary skills are also not always acquired
after a conflict ends since these children often encounter broken family
networks that could have provided a better regulation of the use of
violence and would have helped them to settle in a more peaceful,
institutionalized civil life (Steenkamp, 2005).

#### The existence of child soldiers undermines global security, state building, and foreign aid 

Mary-Jane **Fox 04**, PhD from the Department of Peace and Conflict
Research at Upsaala University in Sweden and professor at Georgetown
University in the Department of Government, December 2004, "Girl
Soldiers: Human Security and Gendered Insecurity," pages 465-467,
doi:[10.1177/0967010604049523](https://doi.org/10.1177/0967010604049523)

THE TOPIC OF CHILD SOLDIERS has received wide exposure in recent years,
[though until recently this appeared to rest on the [assump- tion that
all child soldiers were boys]{.mark}]{.underline}. The girl soldiers who
existed among their ranks were little acknowledged or noticed, even
though they are currently estimated to comprise approximately between
one-tenth and one- third of all child soldiers (Mazurana & McKay, 2004:
115)1 and have been found to exist in almost all non-state political
armed groups. [Nevertheless, the [study of girl soldiers still falls
within the larger issue of child soldiers,]{.mark} primarily because
both boy and girl soldiers legally belong to the special category of
[minors or children,]{.mark} and as such [are entitled to **specific
rights and protections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, girls are
empirically found along with boy soldiers and share many of the same
experiences. [However, it is clear there is an [additional and
**disturbing gendered component** to the girls' experiences, and this
has increasingly demanded more attention.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In addition to being an affront to and a departure from established
norms, [the [very existence of armed minors]{.mark} also [raises
security concerns]{.mark} -- ranging from their being considered a
military threat to their **[representing a breach in the security that
states are expected to provide]{.mark}** for individuals and
society.]{.underline} Although attempts have been made to argue the
former interpretation, this article is more concerned with the latter.2
But whether there is a security perspective that offers a more
theoretically informed understanding of the special circumstances of
girl soldiers has not been previously discussed. In fact, although legal
and empirical reporting on the topic abounds, [there have been few
attempts to conceptualize or attach theory of any kind to the subject of
either child soldiers or girl soldiers, and so both topics have remained
in a state of empirical simplicity.]{.underline} Yet, even though it is
still early days in the empirical study of girl soldiers, theoretically
guided research would not only provide direction to what would otherwise
amount to a panoply of data, but would also contextualize those data and
suggest how they have meaning, particularly in regard to related issues.
At present, how- ever, the theoretical shortcomings in studies of child
soldiers are particularly apparent in literature specializing in
politics and conflict, and the articles that have appeared have tended
to be rhetorical or iterative, or have offered limited analysis.3 [Part
of the reasoning behind this might stem from a desire to keep the topic
apolitical, since it essentially deals with minors and child rights.
However, given that [this is an issue that should be]{.mark} of [great
concern to international and regional]{.mark} peacekeeping [forces,
post-conflict statebuilding]{.mark}, development [aid policy]{.mark},
[and]{.mark}, of course, [security]{.mark}, keeping it swept under an
apolitical carpet does not appear to be sound.]{.underline} This is not
to say that research does not exist: working papers and other
unpublished reports are diffuse, but they exist within a specialized
circle and are not subject to the same scrutiny that published works
endure. Since this is a growing global phe- nomenon that has an impact
on and has been affected by international legal instruments, has earned
its own Special Representative to the Secretary General of the UN, and
has been the focus of myriad reports on human rights and military
matters, the need for systematic analysis and theoretical devel- opment
is clear.

As a step towards bridging the empirical--theoretical gap, [this article
investigates the existence of [girl soldiers]{.mark} in terms of its
[represent]{.mark}ing **[a signifi- cant gap in the security that states
are expected to provide]{.mark}** for their people. Since the [issues
encompassing]{.mark} both [child soldiers]{.mark} in general and girl
soldiers in particular are the **[selfsame issues that underpin a human
security]{.mark}** per- spective, the article attempts to establish a
preliminary **[link between the insecurity of girl soldiers and human
security thinking]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although the con- cept of
human security has its share of detractors, it is not without merit and
may well lead towards a more focused and informed analysis of empirical
reality.

# Leadership Advantage

## 1AC 

### 1AC

#### Advantage 1 is [Leadership]{.underline}:

#### The US has empirically set a global example against child soldiers but waivers to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act undermine leverage and leadership

Jo **Becker 17**, director of the children's rights division at Human
Rights Watch, et al., 2/15/17, "The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission
(TLHRC) holds a briefing on \"Combating Child Soldiering: A Pernicious
Form of Child Trafficking.\"," *Federal News Service*, Accessed via
Lexis Nexis.

So on the positive side, since 2000 over 100,000 children have been
released or demobilized from government militaries or armed groups
around the world. The number of countries where children are actively
fighting has reduced by about a third over the last 20 years. And [there
are 26 governments and armed groups that have signed **concrete
agreements**]{.underline} [with **U**nited **N**ations to end their use
of child soldiers]{.underline}.

But on the other hand, [there are some countries where the
problem]{.underline}, as Gen. Dallaire has pointed out, [has gotten much
worse]{.underline}. For example, in Yemen the rate of child recruitment
increased five times in just one year. In Afghanistan the rate of child
recruitment doubled between 2014 and 2015. In South Sudan the U.N.
believes that over 16,000 children have been recruited just in the last
three years since the conflict re-erupted there.

But today [I want to focus particularly on the role of the **U**nited
**S**tates in tackling this grave problem]{.underline}.

[To its credit, [the U.S. was one of the first]{.mark} countries [to
ratify the child soldiers treaty]{.mark}]{.underline} that was adopted
by the U.N. in the year 2000. [After the U.S. ratified, all four
branches of the U.S. Armed Forces immediately issued regulations to keep
troops that are under the age of 18 out of battle. And [that was]{.mark}
really [**important** to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[set a good example
for]{.mark} other [militaries worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

And then [in 2008]{.underline}, it\'s [to [Congress]{.mark}\'s great
credit]{.underline} that [it [decided to]{.mark} also [tackle this
problem]{.mark} by [using]{.mark} the U.S.]{.underline} [**[leverage
of]{.mark} U.S. [military assistance]{.mark}**. [It
adopted]{.mark}]{.underline} a piece of legislation called [[the
**C**]{.mark}hild **[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention
**[A]{.mark}**ct]{.underline}.

This was a bipartisan bill that was championed by Sen. Sam Brownback
from Kansas and Sen. Dick Durbin from Illinois. It received broad
support, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

[The principle]{.underline} behind this law [is very
simple]{.underline}. It\'s that [the **U**nited **S**tates should not be
providing military assistance that\'s funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars
to governments that use or support the use of child
soldiers]{.underline}.

This bill came into effect in 2010 under the Obama administration. [[It
calls on the State Department to issue a list every year of]{.mark} the
[governments]{.mark} that have been [recruiting child
soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}, using child soldiers or supporting
militias that do so. And in the last seven years that law has been in
effect, between six and 10 countries have been named every year. The
five countries that are consistently on the list from the very beginning
have been Congo, Burma, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

So [[the law provides]{.mark} the U.S. with]{.underline} **[[incredible
leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It tells foreign governments]{.mark}
if you want U.S. military assistance,]{.underline} [**[you can\'t use
child soldiers]{.underline}**. [That\'s a]{.underline}]{.mark} [pretty
**[heavy message]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And under this law we\'ve seen
some **real success stories**]{.underline}. [But we\'ve also seen some
real missed opportunities.]{.underline}

So a couple of examples of how [the law can]{.underline} be \-- can
[really make a difference]{.underline}. One is Congo.

So at the height of Congo\'s war there was 30,000 children fighting on
all sides: government, armed groups, militia. The government had a long
history of using child soldiers, and even promoting military commanders
that had used child soldiers in their ranks.

Now in 2011, shortly after the law went into effect, the U.S. announced
that under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, it was going to withhold
foreign military financing from Congo. And the year after that it
announced that not only would it withhold foreign military financing,
but it would also refuse to train Congolese battalions until Congo
signed a U.N. action plan to end its use of child soldiers.

Now Congo had been dragging its feet for seven years on signing this
plan. But after the U.S. made that announcement, it signed in five days.
And since then child recruitment by the government has reduced to almost
zero. That\'s a big change from 30,000 kids.

So this is a really concrete example of how this law has been used. We
also have positive examples from Rwanda where the U.S. cutting off aid
under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act helped lead to the dissolution
of an armed group in the DRC, the M23.

The threat of sanctions also persuaded Chad to end its use of child
soldiers. And it\'s been off the State Department\'s list now for the
last three years.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} at the same time, [[there are]{.mark} also
real **[missed opportunities]{.mark}**. Since the law went into effect
there have been 43 instances where the administration has had a chance
to use this law to persuade governments to change their
ways]{.underline}. [In 33 of those 43 cases the administration has
chosen to **give a waiver**]{.underline}, a national interest waiver,
[to allow military aid to continue to flow]{.underline}.

And as Jesse mentioned, in the first five years that the law was in
effect, the Simpson Center estimated that over \$1 billion that
could\'ve been sanctioned under this law was allowed to go to
governments using child soldiers.

In fact, the law has been used to only withhold about \$35 million, a
very small percentage of assistance that has gone to these governments.
[Virtually the only countries that have been blocked from getting
military assistance are those countries that were never scheduled to get
any aid in the first place.]{.underline}

So this is the situation. [The U.S. has an]{.underline} **[incredibly
powerful tool]{.underline}** [that it\'s not been using.]{.underline}
And so going forward [we hope]{.underline} that [members of
Congress]{.underline} will [really insist that the administration uses
this law effectively]{.underline} for its intended purpose [to keep U.S.
weapons out of the hands of child soldiers, and to **use leverage**
to]{.underline} try and **[influence foreign governments]{.underline}**
to end this scourge.

Thank you very much.

EAVES: Thank you both for those remarks. Well I guess we can just hop
right into just kind of a quick conversation about this.

Gen. Dallaire, you have been a real pioneer and outspoken advocate on
the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder.

You know when you hear soldiers who talk about being on the battlefield
and coming into contact with a child combatant, and having to make the
choice of whether or not they shoot a child. And talking about how that
hesitation in and of itself could cost the lives of their own men.

And I\'m just curious, what efforts are being made to address the
soldiers\' perspective, and the impact on those who may have to shoot a
child who is pointing a gun at them. I mean is this part of your effort
to reform the overall security sector and some of the training that you
do to disincentivize the use of children?

DALLAIRE: In fact it\'s one of the elements that we have been looking
at.

Being myself injured with PTSD from my experience in Rwanda. The number
of walking wounded that we have who have had to face children and gone
through the ethical and moral, particularly moral dilemmas of having to
use lethal force against children has created traumas that in fact stay
with them. And although treated are not necessarily attenuated.

And so one of the reasons why they find themselves in such a situation
is because there\'s only one of two answers they have. One is to
withdraw and give the opportunity to those who are using children to
gain the advantage. And in so doing not achieve the operational aim. Or
to use lethal force, and in so doing suffer the consequences.

Not long ago in Quebec City where I live, this sergeant came up to me
and we had a good talk. He had five missions under his belt. And we were
talking about his last mission. And I asked him what is job was.

And be broke down instantaneously. Eyes crying, knees shaking, unable to
talk. And when I was able to calm him down, he said \"general,\" he said
\"I was in the reconnaissance platoon in my battalion.\" He said,
\"I\'ve been back for over four years. I have not been able to hug my
children yet.\"

For the number of \-- we in looking at this problem find that if we can
train our military, giving them alternate tools to having to use lethal
force, we can reduce the number of casualties on our side.

But we\'re reducing the casualties on the other side. Because every time
we aren\'t killing those children there\'s an impact on the society in
which \-- from which they come from.

And so the aim is to give a more consistent capability to the forces
that face them, to reduce the scenarios of having to gun-to-gun
situation simply resolve itself by the use of genetic lethal force. But
in fact, having alternate opportunities.

We\'ve seen the introduction more of women into the front lines as being
an incredible impact, a force multiplier. Because ultimately they are
children. And there is a capability of influencing by the mere presence
of children. Particularly the girls that they face.

So we want to reduce casualties on our side, on their side and it be
more effective. And how we\'re doing that is by training.

But by lo and behold, we need people to train trainers. And that\'s
where we started last year with our pilot project of actually hiring and
training veterans. Veterans who\'ve been in the field. And giving them
not only some formal education and academic programs because we\'re
based at Dalhousie University, and given some good, solid political
science information. But the whole program all are doctrinal framework.

And what we\'re seeing is these veterans are able to go back and close
the loop of having left a mission, knowing \-- or missions where the
job\'s not finished. But now they\'re able to train other armies, to
professionalize other forces. That they are now going into the fray with
better tools than what we had, in order to reduce the impact of children
as an effective weapon. But also reducing the impact of having to use
lethal force against them.

And the veterans are proving to be a significant force multiplier. So
they\'re getting another lease on life by actually being there.

And during the last course we ran, two out of the 15 first cohort
actually came forward to their colleagues and said that they had killed
children. And it was the first time since they\'ve been back from
mission that they actually spoke of that. They never even spoke to the
therapist about it.

So there is a wonderful opportunity to give back by veterans into the
fray, and reduce the risks of casualties.

EAVES: Thank you.

And Jo, I remember that this line of reasoning came up in 2008 ahead of
the passage of the Child Soldier Prevention Act. And I think it was in
an Armed Services Committee hearing that someone made the point that you
know they never want to see a U.S. soldier faced with a decision of
pointing their gun at a child, particularly a child that may have been
armed by the U.S.

And [in the final law there was,]{.underline} as you mentioned,
[[this]{.mark} provision put in on [national security
waiver]{.mark}s.]{.underline} And which was a common practice. But one
that, as you pointed out, [[has been used]{.mark} quite
[excessively]{.mark} since 2010.]{.underline}

I was wondering if you could talk about the kind of waivers that have
been used. And then another part of this question is last year in
particular, Afghanistan was not listed, even though there was a sizable
chunk of military assistance that went to Afghanistan, particularly for
support of their national police, which they call \-- which the U.S.
government call a security force, and therefore not eligible under the
law.

So I\'m wondering if you can talk about the issue that\'s come up with
waivers and partial waivers. And then also what this \-- kind of this
latest issue that we\'ve uncovered with security forces, and what that
means for the future of the law.

BECKER: Sure.

First of all [it\'s important to understand that [the **C**]{.mark}hild
**[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention **[A]{.mark}**ct only
[applies to]{.mark} a limited number of military assistance
programs]{.underline}. So even if all of them are prohibited under the
law, it doesn\'t mean that there\'s no military assistance going to a
government of concern. [It applies to six categories,
including]{.underline} foreign military financing, [**[d]{.mark}**irect
**[c]{.mark}**ommercial **[s]{.mark}**ales, **[f]{.mark}**oreign
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[s]{.mark}**ales]{.underline}, IMET, et cetera.

But the law, as Jesse mentions, does give the president a national
security waiver option. And it\'s important to recognize that the U.S.
often has complicated interests with these countries. A country that
uses child soldiers, for example, may also be an important ally in the
War on Terror, for example.

[The president may have legitimate reasons to waive some of
the]{.underline} provisions of the law for U.S. interests. [But our
problem is that this has been the]{.underline} **[norm rather than the
exception]{.underline}**. The vast majority of cases that have come
before the president get waivers.

And there are two kinds of waivers. [The president can give a **full
waiver**]{.underline} to a country, [which means]{.underline} basically
[all]{.underline} of the affected [categories of military assistance
will continue]{.underline} to flow with no strings attached. So a
concrete example of this is Iraq.

Iraq appeared on the State Department\'s list for the first time in
2016. And that\'s because militia groups that are allied with the
government have been recruiting large numbers of child soldiers. But the
president issued a full waiver for Iraq, which means that there will be
no restrictions on Iraq linked to its use of child soldiers. It has no
incentives to address this phenomenon in these militia groups.

Now [on the other hand, there\'s a **partial waiver**]{.underline}
option, which is what we saw with Congo. So the U.S. did not cut off all
military assistance to Congo, but it took a couple of key military aid
packages that Congo cared about, and said we\'re withholding these until
we see some concrete action to end the use of child soldiers. And in
that case we saw that it worked.

So [that\'s sort of a good middle ground. To use a partial waiver as a
way of telling the government that yes, we value you and you know, your
role. We want to you know support you in some ways. But **we can\'t
support you fully**]{.underline} [until you deal with this serious
problem]{.underline}.

Now, Jesse, your second question\'s about Afghanistan. [In general we
have been pretty pleased with the way the State Department has **handled
the listing** of countries. The listing that they put out every
year]{.underline} of countries using child soldiers [tracks pretty
closely with what we see on the ground and what we see reported by the
**U**nited **N**ations]{.underline}. But there\'s been one glaring
exception, and that\'s Afghanistan.

For years there\'s been solidly documented use of child soldiers by
Afghan police forces. Now these are called police forces, but it\'s a
misnomer. These are militia groups that are actively fighting the
Taliban. And they are directly under Afghan government control. And yet
the State Department has argued that because they\'re called police,
they shouldn\'t be affected by this law.

So what it means is that there\'s been no listing of Afghanistan.
There\'s been no sanctions, no prohibitions against Afghanistan. Even
though Afghanistan has acknowledged that it has a problem. And it\'s
even signed an action plan with the U.N. to eliminate its use of child
soldiers.

So unfortunately there\'s yet another example where the U.S. has sort of
you know given up its leverage to make a real difference in a country
where child soldiers is a real problem.

DALLAIRE: Jesse, I want to \-- I think that there is an argument that
doesn\'t seem to come to the floor. I was there with Sen. Durbin
negotiating. And I was very disappointed with the waiver process.

Just as much as I\'m not happy with the fact that we can still recruit
in our militaries under the age of 18, the British, the Canadians, the
Australians, the Americans. Although we don\'t send them to operational
theaters, we still train them for being ready when they hit 18 to be
deployed.

I think the essence of it is that we don\'t bring to the floor enough
the fact that the use of child soldiers by either the non-state actors
or state actors, the belligerence simply continues to sustain the wars.
Because we\'re using a weapons system. We\'re using a means to continue
the fight.

In Jordan when we were there, the refugee camps, Syrian refugee camps,
they were recruiting 13-year-olds to go fight for the Free Syrian Army.
And all they are is cannon fodder. They just keep their fight going.

So if you shifted the idea that the child soldier sustains war, sustains
conflict, then I think there\'s better incentive for the United States
not to give up this opportunity of holding people accountable. Because
you\'re saying you keep using kids, they\'re keeping using kids. Ergo,
you\'re keeping the war going.

So pull out. Stop it. And that can be an incentive for the other side.
And then build on that.

And I would argue that you would potentially change the nature of the
argument like we\'re doing in South Sudan right now. Getting them to
stop on both sides to recruit child soldiers is one way of getting to
the table, because we\'re talking about children. But more importantly,
it is also a way of breaking the absolute power that they have by being
to recruit and mobilize on an unlimited scale this weapon.

EAVES: You have this very jarring description as the weapons system,
children as a weapons system. And I\'m curious. How much of the problem
is with state armies, police and militias, versus non- state actors?
Where are you seeing the use of this weapons system, the use of these
children?

DALLAIRE: With the U.N. and the help of organizations like Jo and
others, and we\'ve been working at it. There\'s now only seven countries
out of 194 that recruit them. Although there may be some doing it and
we\'re not necessarily fully aware of. But there\'s only these seven
countries. And they\'re wavering.

And so was we attempt to continue to influence them, not to use them.
Because we\'re proving that they\'re not that good a weapon system in
the first place. They\'re of limited value. If you really want to make
\-- if you were to win the conflict, they\'re \-- they have a limited
capability. And certainly a limited potential to increase your
capability.

However, it\'s in the non-state actors. And it\'s interesting that when
we attempt to go at non-state actors and try to get them to shift gears
in regards to child soldiers, we\'re not very much supported. People
don\'t want to fund people who want to go and try to make non- state
actors more responsible.

In fact, it\'s sort of a weird construct. And so we work with people
like Geneva Cole (ph), who are initiating new ways of communicating with
them.

When I was in South Sudan, I went in as an advocate, as a retired
commander. So I went and met with the general of, as an example, the
COBRA Force. And after two hours of talking and discussing, and ending
up by insulting them by saying how can you call yourself a general if
you\'re going to need kids to fight your war?

He released 300 children in that time. So we can use other means to get
at it. And I think that the more presence of not just the NGO world, but
ex-military and commanders in talking soldier-to-soldier we can actually
prove to them that they\'re in the wrong game. By basing their aim, long
or good or whatever, on the use of children.

BECKER: Can I just add something to that? I think that even though
numerically non-state actors, rebel groups outnumber the number of
governments using child soldiers, it\'s really important to pressure
those governments to abandon this practice.

Because [[as long as governments are using child soldiers]{.mark}, you
know [non-state actors, rebel groups]{.mark} will [have an
excuse]{.mark}]{.underline}. They\'ll point to the state and say if the
government is doing it, why can\'t we?

But [[if we]{.mark} can [eliminate it on the part of
governments]{.mark}, then [it\'s]{.mark} much [easier to go to non-state
actors and say]{.mark} if you want to be taken seriously, [if you want
to be]{.mark} seen as [credible, you need to]{.mark} be able
to]{.underline} **[[meet the laws of war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [just as
governments do.]{.underline}

DALLAIRE: As an example to reinforce, when I met with the south Sudanese
generals, I didn\'t go in there and tell them, you\'re using child
soldiers also and we\'re holding you accountable and you\'re a bad guy
and so on.

What I went in with \-- we went in and we said listen, we know you\'re
facing child soldiers by the non-state actors, by the rebel \-- what are
you doing? How are you handling that? How are you training your soldiers
to handle this? How are you neutralizing that?

And through the discussion of them trying to explain what they were
doing to try and make their child soldiers ineffective without affecting
their troops, we ended up talking about their child soldiers.

And so indirect approach can be sometimes very effective in these.
Because the ego of these people is so dominant that you can break it by
in fact making them realize that they\'re actually using children to
fight their war. Children are not there to fight adult wars.

EAVES: One final question. And then we\'re going to turn it over to the
audience to ask some questions. Jo, I\'m curious. Just based on your
experience so far with the Child Soldier Prevention Act, are there any
changes that can be made that can make it a more effective tool? What
can be done to give the U.S. the leverage that it needs to particularly
go after the state actors that are wielding such potential devastative
power?

BECKER: I think there are a couple of things that can be done.

I mean certainly [part of it lies with the administration and their
implementation of the law.]{.underline} And [really using it to **full
effect** by]{.underline} you know, [minimizing the use of
waivers]{.underline} whenever \-- in as many cases as possible. And
recognizing that, for example, in the case of Afghanistan you know
police forces that are actively engaged in combat need to be covered by
the law.

For that latter place, though, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[need]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[help from
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} you know
[clarify the law and articulate that that in fact is the
case]{.underline}. And you know we\'re interested too in talking with
members of Congress [about how we can [minimize]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[use of waivers]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Eliminating national interest waivers ensures effective application of the CSPA

Rachel **Stohl 16**, director of the Conventional Defense program at the
nonpartisan Stimson Center, et al., 11/30/16, "Obama\'s Lost Opportunity
on Child Soldiers",
https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-09-30/obamas-lost-opportunity-on-child-soldiers

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Child Soldiers Prevention Act [[(CSPA) is
intended to **leverage**]{.mark} coveted U.S. [**military
assistance**]{.mark} and encourage governments [to stop using children
in combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Signed into law in 2008, the CSPA took
effect in 2010 and restricts U.S. military support to countries
identified by the State Department as having recruited and used child
soldiers in their national militaries or government-supported armed
groups. If a country appears on the annual CSPA list, it may be
ineligible to receive U.S. weapons and military assistance in the
following fiscal year.

[[The president may]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [**[waive]{.mark}**
these [prohibitions]{.mark}]{.underline} (in part or in full) [[in the
name of]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. \"[[national interest]{.mark}\" and
allow offending countries to continue to receive arms]{.underline} and
assistance despite their recruitment and/or use of child soldiers. For
the last six years, the Obama administration has justified the use of
\"national interest\" waivers to support broader security concerns
including counterterrorism and efforts to fight non-state armed groups.

This year, 10 countries are identified on the CSPA list: Burma, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia,
South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Obama administration granted
full waivers to Burma, Iraq and Nigeria, partial waivers to the DRC,
Somalia, South Sudan and Rwanda and did not waive the prohibitions on
Sudan, Syria and Yemen \-- three countries that are not slated to
receive any U.S. military assistance or arms sales. In effect, [these
waivers will allow at least \$273 million in military assistance to flow
to countries known to be using child soldiers.]{.underline} This has
been a consistent pattern of behavior for the Obama administration. Over
the past six years, the administration has provided more than \$1.2
billion in military assistance and arms sales to the 13 countries
identified for recruiting and using child soldiers.

\[UNICEF: Nearly 50 Million Children \'Uprooted\' Worldwide\]

Many of the countries identified by the State Department this year have
appeared on the CSPA list since its inception, with five reappearing on
the list every year since 2010. Nearly all of these countries have
received either full or partial waivers at some point in time. Indeed,
this year, the president waived only the assistance it was planning to
provide and prohibited assistance that was never slated to be delivered.
Over the past six years, the administration has withheld just over \$56
million in military assistance and \$5 million in arms sales to
violating countries, or less than five percent of funds that would have
been restricted had it not used waivers. It is not difficult to prohibit
assistance that was never going to provided.

This last round of waiver determinations has cemented Obama\'s legacy on
preventing the use of child soldiers worldwide. Although there have been
some positive changes under the CSPA \-- some countries such as Chad
have been removed from the CSPA list when they have eliminated the use
of child soldiers \-- overall the Obama administration has been loathe
to leverage the full weight of the CSPA. [[Rather than using the CSPA as
a carrot]{.mark} to encourage governments to stop recruiting and using
child soldiers, [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has]{.mark}
largely [given a **free pass** to]{.mark} some of the world\'s worst
[violators]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, in the midst of the brutality of the conflict in South Sudan,
where forces on all sides of the conflict continue to use children to
wage war, the United States has waived Juba\'s sanctions in part based
on the justification that South Sudanese forces will continue to take
part in the hunt for soldiers in the Lord\'s Resistance Army \-- a group
infamous for its systematic kidnapping and use of child soldiers. The
irony of supporting one government that is using child soldiers to hunt
down a group that has relied upon child soldiers to wage war for decades
seems to be lost on the Obama administration, which has waived CSPA
prohibitions every year for South Sudan and permitted the country to
receive \$120 million in U.S. military assistance and more than \$20
million in U.S. arms sales.

During the course of its term, the Obama administration has [missed a
vital opportunity to ensure that the CSPA carries more weight than the
paper it\'s written on.]{.underline} The administration\'s habitual [use
of]{.underline} full or partial national interest
[[waivers]{.underline}]{.mark} has, in effect, [[void]{.mark}ed much of
[the act\'s potential]{.mark} impact to help improve]{.underline} the
[lives]{.underline} of children around the world. Instead of
incentivizing countries to demobilize child soldiers and prevent further
recruitment into military and/or paramilitary groups, the administration
[repeatedly sent a message to violating countries that they could
continue to use child soldiers with little to no
consequence.]{.underline}

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has a powerful tool]{.mark} to stop the internationally condemned
practice of child soldiers, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} due to political
considerations \-- notably the importance given to providing assistance
to help support counterterrorism efforts \-- [the CSPA [has fallen
short]{.mark} of its potential.]{.underline}

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has]{.mark} an [opportunity to **be a leader**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
efforts to limit and ultimately prevent the use of child soldiers.
[Although [the CSPA]{.mark} is not a panacea to stop the horrific
practice of child soldiers, it is a tool that [should be
used]{.mark}]{.underline} by the next administration [[to **promote
change in government behavior**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and protect the
most vulnerable]{.underline}**.** Children around the world deserve
better.

PART V: THE CHILD SOLDIER PREVENTION ACT OF 2008

A. The Promulgation & Purpose of the CSPA

On December 23, 2008, the U.S. Congress amended the William Wilberforce
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 and included
Title IV, which is now known as the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of
2008 (CSPA). The CSPA, given full effect in June of 2009, is a
unilateral, legislative act that bars the U.S. government from
providing, among other things, financial assistance to another
nation-states' government "that is clearly identified . . . for the most
recent year . . . as having governmental armed forces or
government-supported armed groups . . . that recruit child soldiers."136
Section 405 of the CSPA also requires the U.S. to go on international
excursions, conduct thorough investigations into any reports of child
soldier use, and prepare reports that document the U.S.'s findings.137

B. Noteworthy Strengths of the CSPA

In addition to defining international norms and drawing more attention
to those norms, [[states have]{.underline}]{.mark} the compelling
[[power to directly enforce]{.mark} their economic sanctions against
states that violate international human rights norms and
laws.]{.underline} The [General Assembly of [the UN does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} have this power.124 Albeit influential and
widely respected, the United Nations General Assembly is "empowered to
make only non-binding recommendations to States on international issues
within its competence."125 Therefore, General Assembly
[[resolutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, much like the aforementioned twenty
consecutive resolutions against the U.S.'s continued use of unilateral
economic sanctions against Cuba, [[are not binding]{.mark}
against]{.underline} UN [member states.]{.underline}126 So, "\[w\]hile
[the \[UN\]]{.underline} views its treaties and conventions as binding
on \[s\]tate \[p\]arties, it [has no police power mechanism to
enforce]{.underline} its [decisions]{.underline}; \[UN treaties\] are
'limited by the signatories' willingness to comply.'"127

[[This]{.mark} limitation]{.underline}, which negatively impacts the
effectiveness of UN-adopted treaties such as the OP-CRC, "[[make\[s\]
implementing procedures to abolish]{.mark} the [use of child soldiers
**unattainable without**]{.mark} **local and [national
efforts.]{.mark}**]{.underline}"128 Heather L. Carmody, capturing this
frustration in a 2012 article, writes,

[Although the international community]{.underline} has [condemned the
use of child soldiers, military recruiters continue to defy these
international norms.]{.underline} Moral condemnation or treaties
prohibiting child soldiers often fall on deaf ears in countries that are
torn by internal conflict, civil war, and poverty. Recruiters \[may\]
have reached such a state of violence that all standards of moral and
ethical conduct cease to exist or hold meaning. Releasing child soldiers
may be seen as impractical to a militia embroiled in a civil war, where
replenishing combatants is a constant preoccupation.129

Many scholars recognize this limitation of the United Nations General
Assembly's resolutions and similarly structured multilateral agreements,
citing the lack of police power as one major hindrance to getting state
offenders of international norms to respect and follow those norms.130

Andrew Philip of Amnesty International, commenting on child soldier
commanders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, once stated that such
commanders "know it's a war crime, but they seem to believe they'll
never be brought to justice. There is a sense of rampant impunity."131
[[The U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} and other influential states, on the
other hand, [[may implement]{.mark} unilateral economic [sanctions that
create a **direct incentive**]{.mark} for sanctioned states [to]{.mark}
observe and [comply with]{.mark} international human rights
[norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are codified by international
entities like the UN. Plainly stated, [unilateral economic sanctions go
a step beyond emphasizing the usual moral and ethical implications of a
state's violation of international human rights law]{.underline}; they
target states' economic stability, which has arguably accelerated
offending state's willingness to comply with international human rights
laws.132

Some scholars, in light of both the known benefits and drawbacks
associated with unilateral economic sanctions, have proposed that the
U.S. and other nation-states refine the drafting process of their
future, respective unilateral economic sanctions.133 [In order for the
U.S. to simultaneously strengthen both negative and positive human
rights through the use of these sanctions, it should only implement
smart sanctions, or sanctions that are "narrowly tailored to minimize
civilian suffering]{.underline} [through measures such as]{.underline}
visa denials and [the freezing of assets.]{.underline}"13

Essentially, unilateral economic sanctions simply lack balance when they
ignore the positive human rights of citizens within the sanctioned
state. The thoughtful drafting of sanctions, which take into account the
entire spectrum of foreign citizens' human rights, will likely garner
more support from the international community. Furthermore, [[the U.S.
should]{.mark} document and **[condemn international human rights
violations in an even-handed, uniform manner]{.mark}**]{.underline}.135
Unilateral economic sanctions that reflect the application of these
recommendations may help to promote the full spectrum of foreign
citizens' human rights and reduce the potential for sanction to
undermine the goal of promoting global respect for international human
rights law. [[Sanctions]{.mark} that fall short of]{.underline}
contemplating all of these [recommendations, [like the **C**]{.mark}hild
**[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention **[A]{.mark}**ct of
2008[,]{.mark} [need to be amended]{.mark} in order [to best promote
international human rights norms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The CSPA]{.underline}]{.mark}, albeit flawed, has several positive
attributes. These [positive attributes]{.underline}, when coupled with
smart reformation of the CSPA, [[could]{.mark} allow the Act to
[be]{.mark}come [an **excellent tool**]{.mark} **for the advancement of
the international community's interest of promoting global respect for
and observance of international human rights norms.**]{.underline} The
[CSPA's definition of]{.underline} the term "[child
soldier]{.underline}," for example, [is]{.underline} appropriately
representative of international principles, as it is [consistent with
the OP-CRC's definition.]{.underline} The term extends to:

(v) any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in
    hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces;

(vi) any person under 18 years of age who has been compulsorily
     recruited into governmental armed forces;

(vii) any person under 15 years of age who has been voluntarily
      recruited into governmental armed forces; or

(viii) any person under 18 years of age who has been recruited or used
       in hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of
       a state; and

> \(B\) includes any person described in clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of
> subparagraph (A) who is serving in any capacity, including in a
> support role such as a cook, porter, messenger, medic, guard, or sex
> slave.13

The CRC's definition of the term "child soldier," by following the
UN-adopted OP-CRC's definition, is in essence promoting international
human rights norms established by the UN. [The definition specifically
outlines exactly who the international community deems to be a child
soldier, which, thereby, standardizes the concept and provides a uniform
basis to judge whether or not a state has indeed violated international
human rights norms regarding the use of child soldiers.]{.underline}

\(1\) the United States Government . . . condemn the conscription,
forced recruitment, or use of children by governments, paramilitaries,
or other organizations;

\(2\) the United States Government . . . support and, to the extent
practicable, lead efforts to establish and uphold international
standards designed to end the abuse of human rights described in
paragraph (1); \[and\] \...

\(7\) \[the\] United States diplomatic missions in countries in which
governments use or tolerate child soldiers \[to\] . . . develop
strategies, as part of annual program planning---

\(A\) to promote efforts to end such abuse of human rights; and

\(B\) to identify and integrate global best practices, as available,
into such strategies to avoid duplication of efforts.140

Section 403(1) of the [[CSPA plainly condemns the use of child
soldiers]{.mark} by any state or armed group,]{.underline}141 [which
candidly aligns the interests of the U.S. with the interests of the
**U**nited **N**ations]{.underline} as outlined in Chapter 9, Articles
55 and 56 of the UN Charter.142 As previously stated, Article 56 of the
UN charter requires the U.S., as a UN member state, "to take . . .
separate action. . . for the achievement of the purposes set forth in
Article 55,"143 which requires the UN to promote "universal respect for,
and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without
distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion."144 Sections 403(2)
and 403(7) of the CSPA, [[while]{.mark} also [showing the U.S.'s
commitment to]{.mark} promoting respect for foreign citizens' human
rights, specifically [prioritize]{.mark} the promotion of [international
human rights standards]{.mark} or norms [over]{.mark} the U.S.'s own
[domestic standards]{.mark}, insofar as they may differ.]{.underline}145

Also, [[Congress]{.mark} seemingly [**promotes uniformity** in the
application of]{.mark} the [CSPA by requiring]{.mark} the Secretary of
State to produce and publish [an annual report]{.mark}]{.underline} that
describes "the use of child soldiers in each foreign country"146 and by
requiring the Secretary of State to "formally notify any government
identified" as in violation of the CSPA.147 [By requiring an annual
report including information as to a foreign nation-state's use of child
soldiers, the U.S. will be armed with data and, in theory, will be
better able to apply its unilateral economic sanctions consistently and
fairly according to each foreign state's progress or lack
thereof.]{.underline} Also, the state being sanctioned will be given
notice that it is in violation of international human rights standards,
which puts the nation on direct notice of its non-adherence to accepted
international human rights standards. Furthermore, [this reporting
mechanism]{.underline} also [provides other nation-states with an
opportunity to see how they each are perceived by the U.S. and within
the international community in regard to human rights
concerns.]{.underline}

Lastly[, the [unilateral sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} that may be
[applied to foreign states under the CSPA [are appropriately limited to
financial aid]{.mark} and assistance designated [for]{.mark} the
development of each eligible foreign state's
[military.]{.mark}]{.underline}148 The Act "prohibits the following
forms of assistance to governments that are identified in the list:
international military education and training, foreign military
financing, excess defense articles, section 1206 assistance, and the
issuance of licenses for direct commercial sales of military
equipment."149 [Therefore, the CSPA does not prohibit the U.S. from
providing non-military-related humanitarian aid to citizens of a nation,
whose government has violated the CSPA.]{.underline}150 [Based upon
these aforementioned strengths, [the CSPA has a]{.mark} relatively
[sturdy foundation, which **squares well with international human rights
standards**]{.mark} held by organizations such as the
UN.]{.underline}151

C. Salient Weaknesses of the CSPA

The [CSPA, albeit drafted in accordance with international human rights
standards, tells a very different story when it comes to the manner in
which the U.S. has applied the legislation.]{.underline}152 Frankly[,
[the Act]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[does not
appear]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[applied evenly in]{.mark} the
interest of promoting global respect for human rights, but]{.underline}
seems [rather]{.underline} to be applied **[[in accordance with]{.mark}
the [U.S.'s]{.mark} own domestic, political objectives and [foreign
policy interests.]{.mark}]{.underline}**153 Furthermore, the CSPA lacks
specificity and does not provide key benchmarks or measures on which the
U.S. may base its determination as to whether a foreign state is
actively doing enough in its mission to refrain from using children in
armed conflicts.

1\. The National Interest Waiver

The national interest waiver, or section 404(c) of the CSPA, allows the
President to unilaterally waive the CSPA's application to a nation-state
"if \[he\] determines that such waiver is in the national interest of
the United States."154 Any 404(c)(1) waiver of funds pursuant to the
CSPA will likely occur as a result of a nation-state's human right
violations, outlined within the annual Trafficking in Persons Report
(TIP Report).155 As acknowledged by the U.S. Department of State,
"\[t\]he CSPA requires publication in the annual TIP Report of a list of
foreign governments identified during the previous year as having
governmental armed forces or government-supported armed groups that
recruit and use child soldiers, as defined in the Act."156

In 2012, the CSPA cited seven countries whose governments have offended
the CSPA.157 Burma, Libya, South Sudan, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo were the offending countries listed
within the TIP Report.158 Of the seven nation-states listed within the
2012 report, four were receiving funds under the CSPA at and prior to
the time that the report was released.159

President Barack Obama's [[continued]{.mark}, selective [choice to
waive]{.mark} the CSPA's [applicability]{.mark} to]{.underline} certain
[violating foreign states seems to [offend]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[Act's explicit [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} "support. . . and, to the extent practicable,
[[**lead efforts to establish and uphold international standards**
designed to end the abuse of human rights.]{.underline}]{.mark}"160
Currently, three of those four nation-states, which include Libya, South
Sudan, and Yemen, continue to receive full funding otherwise prohibited
by the CSPA due to President Obama's waiver of the Act's application to
those states.161 President Obama has also allowed the fourth
nationstate, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to receive partial
funding by exercising his waiver authority.162

#### Revitalizing human rights promotion is key to American leadership

Amanda **Schnetzer 16**, a Fellow in Global Initiatives at the George W.
Bush Presidential Center, 7/21/16, "Why promoting freedom and human
rights is in our national interest,"
https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2016/07/why-promoting-freedom-is-in-national-interest.html

Substantially more people experience liberty today than at the end of
World War II, but [more than half the world's population still lives in
countries where basic political rights and civil liberties are only
partly respected, if at all]{.underline}. The last decade in particular
has not been good for freedom.

For ten consecutive years, Freedom House has documented [a worrisome
"decline in global freedom."]{.underline} The National Endowment for
Democracy has warned of [authoritarian regimes cracking down at home
while also "seeking to reshape the international order and democratic
norms."]{.underline}

[[From China to Russia]{.mark} to the Middle East, the [challengers to
liberalism are gaining]{.mark} ground. [It is in the direct]{.mark} and
immediate [interest of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[to]{.mark} help [**shift the balance** by supporting]{.mark} the
advance of **[human rights]{.mark}** and freedom
[abroad]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The current mood in the United States does not appear conducive to this
strategy. New Pew Research polling shows that 69 percent of Americans
believe the United States should "concentrate more on our own national
problems." Seventy percent want the next U.S. president to focus on
domestic policy over foreign policy.

Yet [[in order to address]{.underline}]{.mark} the "[major
threats]{.underline}" that keep Americans awake at night ---
**[[ISIS]{.mark}, foreign [cyberattacks, global economic
instability,]{.mark} the spread of infectious [disease]{.mark}s, the
[refugee crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}--- **[[strong U.S.
leadership is required]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as are strategies that
help advance rule of law, good governance, open markets, and other
features of free societies.

So where do we go from here?

[One step would be for policymakers]{.underline}, presidential
candidates, and other public office hopefuls [to make the promotion of
democracy and human rights an important part of their foreign policy
agendas]{.underline}. This March, 139 policy experts, civil society
leaders, and former elected officials---Republicans and Democrats
alike---signed a letter encouraging the presidential candidates to do
just that.

While recognizing that "democracy and human rights cannot be the only
items on the foreign policy agenda," the letter calls it a "false
choice" to pit the pursuit of democratic ideals against national
security. I was proud to sign that letter.

A second step would be to engage the American people in a conversation
about the impact of advancing freedom on our own peace, prosperity, and
security.

At the end of World War II, for example, many questioned whether
democracy was compatible with Germany and Japan. The United States
actively supported the development of democratic institutions and
practices. Today, Germany and Japan are among our strongest partners and
allies in the world, and Americans reap tangible benefits.

In North Texas, where the Bush Institute is located, the relocation of
Toyota's North American headquarters is expected to create jobs and have
an economic impact of \$7 billion in the first ten years, according to
estimates when the move was announced.

[[During the Cold War, the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[supported democratic reform]{.mark} in places like Taiwan, South Korea,
the Philippines, and [Chile]{.mark}. The end of the Cold War was a major
victory for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe. After decades of
Soviet nuclear threat, it also was a great victory for American peace
and security.]{.underline}

[Today,]{.underline} [the **moral and strategic imperatives** [of
advancing human rights]{.mark} are just as compelling.]{.underline} In
Afghanistan, investing in women [[promotes stability and helps reduce
the possibility of]{.underline}]{.mark} future [[**terrorist attacks**
on the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} emanating
from that country[. In the Middle East, the spread of Islamic extremism
and ISIS has had devastating consequences, and the United States is not
immune. In North Korea, a regime that systematically and horrifically
abuses the rights of its own people seeks nuclear weapons that can reach
our shores.]{.underline}

In these and other places, [it is in the interests of the United States
to see the forces of freedom eventually prevail.]{.underline}

A third step would be to find opportunities for immediate bipartisan
action. Both Republican and Democrat presidents have affirmed the U.S.
commitment to standing for freedom at home and leading the advance of
freedom abroad. Congress, too, has played an important role.

Ensuring continued support for democracy and development assistance
overseas, promoting progress on human rights in trade and economic
agreements, and continuing support for initiatives like the President\'s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that relieve human suffering are
just some of the options available to policymakers today.

[In the current political environment, this may be a tall order, but the
stakes at home and abroad are high and **[American leadership is
essential]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### That solves extinction

Max **Yulis 17**, writer for the Penn Political Review, 4/8/17, "In
Defense of Liberal Internationalism,"
http://pennpoliticalreview.org/2017/04/in-defense-of-liberal-internationalism/

Over the past decade, [international [headlines]{.mark} have been
[bombard]{.mark}ed with stories [about]{.mark} the [**unraveling** of
the]{.mark} post-Cold War **[world order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
[creation of revolutionary smart devices and **[military
tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}, [the rise of militant **jihadist
organizations**]{.underline}, [and **[nuclear
prolif]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. Indeed, [times are paradoxically
**promising and alarming**]{.underline}. In relation to treating the
world's ills, fortunately, [[there is a capable
hegemon]{.underline}]{.mark}-- [one that has the ability [to **revive**
]{.mark}**the [world order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
traditionally hallmarked **[human rights]{.mark}**, [**peace**, and
**democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [with
all of its shortcomings, had [crafted]{.mark} an international agenda
that significantly impacted the [post-WWII
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Countries invested their ambitions into
security communities, international institutions, and international law
in an effort [to mitigate]{.mark} the [chances of]{.mark} a **[nuclear
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} another **[World
War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The horrors and atrocities of the two Great
Wars had traumatized the global community, which spurred calls for peace
and the creation of a universalist agenda. Today, [[the world's
**fickle**]{.mark} and **[declining hegemon]{.mark}** still [has]{.mark}
the [**ability**,]{.mark} but **[not]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}**, to
uphold the world order]{.underline} that it had so carefully and eagerly
helped construct. Now, [the stakes are too high, and there must be a
mighty and willing global leader to lead the effort of diffusing
democratic ideals and reinforcing stability through both military and
diplomatic means]{.underline}. To do this, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} [[must abandon]{.mark} its insurgent
wave of [**isolationism** and **protectionism**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and come to grips with the newly transnational nature of problems
ranging from **climate change** to **international
terrorism**]{.underline}.

First, [the]{.underline} increase in intra-state conflict should warrant
concern as many countries, namely in Africa and the Middle East, are
seeing the total collapse of civil society and government. These [power
vacuums are being filled with]{.underline} increasingly
**[ideological]{.underline}** [and dangerous tribal and non-state
actors]{.underline}, such as **[Boko Haram]{.underline}**,
**[ISIS]{.underline}**, [and **Al-Shabaab**]{.underline}. Other bloody
civil wars in Rwanda, Sudan, and the Congo have contributed to the
deaths of millions in the past two decades. As the West has seen,
however, military intervention has not been all that successful in
building and empowering democratic institutions in the Far East. A civil
crusade, along with the strengthening of international institutions, may
in fact be the answer to undoing tribal, religious, and sectarian
divisions, thereby mitigating the prospects of civil conflict. During
the Wilsonian era, missionaries did their part to internationalize the
concept of higher education, which has contributed to the growth of
universities in formerly underdeveloped countries such as China and
South Korea.\[1\] In addition, the teachings of missionaries emphasized
the universality of humanity and the oneness of man, which was
antithetical to the justifications for imperialism and the rampant
sectarianism that plagued much of the Middle East and Africa.\[2\]
Seeing that an increase in [the [magnitude of human casualty is]{.mark}
becoming [more]{.mark} of a reality [due to]{.mark} advancements in
**[military tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline} and the increasing
outbreaks of civil war, [international **[coop]{.mark}**eration
[and]{.mark} the diffusion of **[norms]{.mark}** that highlight the
importance of **stable governance**, **democracy**, and human **rights**
[is the **only recourse**]{.mark} to address the rise in sectarian
divides and civil conflicts]{.underline}. [[So long as the trend]{.mark}
of the West's desire [to **look inward** continues]{.mark}, it is likely
that nation [states]{.mark} **mired in conflict** [will]{.mark} devolve
into ethnic or tribal **enclaves** bent on [rely]{.mark}ing [on **war**
to maintain]{.mark} their legitimacy and [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Aside from growing sectarianism and the increasing prevalence of failed
states, [an even more daunting threat come from weapons that
**transcend** the costs of **conventional warfare**]{.underline}.

The problem of nuclear proliferation has been around for decades, and on
the eve of President Trump's inauguration, it appeared that
[[Obama's]{.mark} lofty [goal of advocating]{.mark} for
**[nonprolif]{.mark}eration** [would **no**]{.mark} [**longer** be **a
priority**]{.mark} of American foreign policy]{.underline}.\[3\] In
addition, now that [[the]{.mark} American [president is threatening to
undo]{.mark} much of the United States' extensive network of
**[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [formerly [non-nuclear states
may]{.mark} be forced to **[rearm]{.mark}** themselves]{.underline}.
[Disarmament is central to liberal internationalism]{.underline}, as was
apparent by the Washington Naval Treaty advocated by Wilson, and by the
modern CTBT treaty. The reverse is, however, being seen in the modern
era, [with [cries]{.mark} coming [from **Japan** and **So**]{.mark}uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea [to]{.mark} **[remobilize]{.mark}** and begin their
own **[nuclear]{.mark} weapon [programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[4\] [A
world with more nuclear actors is a formula for chaos]{.underline},
especially if nuclear weapons become mass-produced. [[**Non-state
actors** will]{.mark} increasingly [eye]{.mark} these nuclear
sites]{.underline} as was the case near a Belgian nuclear power plant
just over a year ago.\[5\] If [any government commits a serious misstep,
access to nuclear [weapons on]{.mark} the [behalf of
**terrorist**]{.mark} and **insurgent groups** [will become]{.mark} a
[reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially if a civil war occurs. States
with nuclear weapons require domestic stability and strong security,
which is why states such as **[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, [[and
**Pakistan** could be in serious trouble]{.mark} in the event of a
**domestic uprising** or military coup]{.underline}. [The
[disarmament]{.mark} of all states [is **essential for**]{.mark} **human
[survival]{.mark}**, and [if it is not achieved]{.mark}, then [a world
full of nuclear weapons]{.mark} and an international system [guided by
realpolitik could]{.mark} give [rise to **nuclear
war**]{.mark}fare.]{.underline} In today's world, nuclear weapons leave
all states virtually defenseless. But, for nuclear deproliferation to
become a cornerstone of the global agenda, a pacifying and democratic
power must rise to the limelight to advocate the virtues of peace,
stability, and human rights.

#### The plan spills over to effective democracy promotion\-\--it leverages military assistance for democratic norms in developing countries

Rachel **Stohl** **15**, adjunct professor in Security Studies Program
Georgetown University and Managing Director at the Stimson Center, and
Shannon Dick, M.A. in Security Studies from Georgetown University and
research analyst at the Stimson Center. 2/6/15, "Using Military
Assistance To Combat The Use Of Child Soldiers,"
https://reliefweb.int/report/world/using-military-assistance-combat-use-child-soldiers

A range of [[international mechanisms exist that prohibit]{.mark} the
use of [child soldiers]{.mark} in armed conflict.]{.underline} The
[United Nations' Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict requires
governments to take measures to ensure that persons under the age of 18
do not take part in hostilities and are not compulsorily recruited into
armed forces. In March 2014, the [U.N. Security Council]{.mark} adopted
[Resolution 2143]{.mark}, which]{.underline} condemns violations of
relevant international law regarding the use of children by all parties
to armed conflict. It also [calls on member states to implement
time-bound action plans to ensure that children are not used in their
armed forces or serve in hostilities. While 23 parties -- both
government and non-state armed groups alike -- have signed such action
plans, many [have **not consistently implemented**]{.mark} these
commitments]{.underline}, in part due to sustained armed violence.

While these measures represent significant steps to reduce and
ultimately end the use of children in armed conflict, [few approaches
have substantially addressed the impact that arms transfers and military
assistance have on the use of child soldiers. Though the connection
between global arms transfers and child soldiers has been
well-established, very few states have taken steps to condition the
provision of military assistance to countries that use and recruit child
soldiers.]{.underline}

Impact of Arms Transfers

[The global arms trade]{.underline} -- in its legitimate and
illegitimate forms -- [continues to fuel the recruitment of child
soldiers around the world.]{.underline} Indeed, the [dynamics of this
trade have made weapons more accessible]{.underline} to more actors,
[and despite the efforts of the international community]{.underline} to
limit the flow of weapons to parties complicit in violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law, both [**[legal and
illicit arms transfers continue to be made]{.mark}** to human rights
abusing governments and nefarious rebel groups.]{.underline} Many of
these actors forcibly recruit children to undertake menial tasks or to
serve as combatants. For years, [civil society, national governments,
and [international organizations]{.mark} have [recognize]{.mark}d the
[links]{.mark} between arms transfers and the unlawful recruitment or
use of children in armed conflict, [and called upon states to
abolish]{.mark} and criminalize [arms transfers]{.mark} to state and
non-state actors that have records of recruiting and using children in
armed conflict. Yet, few countries have actually taken steps to limit
transfers of weapons that could facilitate the use of children in armed
conflict.]{.underline} Indeed, [many countries with a proven track
record of recruiting child soldiers rely on weapons and military
assistance from some of the world's leading arms exporters.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline}, for example, [has exported millions of dollars in
small arms and light weapons to South Sudan, where child soldier
recruitment is rampant]{.underline} with more than 10,000 children
believed to be fighting in government and rebel armies. Similarly,
[Germany and France -- both among the top five weapons exporters in the
world -- have exported arms to the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), where the national army and various rebel groups are known to
forcibly recruit child soldiers.]{.underline} And [the United States,
the world's largest arms exporter, has consistently provided weapons and
military assistance to Yemen]{.underline} to be used in counterterrorism
operations, [despite widespread international condemnation for its use
of child soldiers.]{.underline}

The U.S. Response

[**T**he **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is [one of]{.mark} the
[few countries to]{.mark} have [take]{.mark}n [steps to condition the
provision of military assistance based]{.mark} upon [on]{.mark} a
[country's]{.mark} record [of child soldier use.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Through [the **C**hild **S**oldiers **P**revention **A**ct]{.underline}
(CSPA), the United States implemented national legislation to [prohibit
arms transfers and military training to countries identified by the
State Department as having recruited and used child soldiers in national
militaries or government-supported armed groups.]{.underline} In
addition, the Act incentivizes U.S. military assistance by encouraging
governments that use child soldiers to end the internationally condemned
practice.

Though the CSPA does not provide complete prohibition against all U.S.
military assistance, it does limit foreign military sales, direct
commercial sales, excess defense articles, international military
education and training, foreign military financing, and some
peacekeeping operations assistance -- which represent the largest U.S.
arms sales and military assistance programs. Under the Act, [governments
can receive otherwise prohibited assistance to professionalize their
militaries if the U.S. president certifies that the country is taking
reasonable steps to demobilize child soldiers as well as providing
rehabilitation and reintegration assistance.]{.underline} Certification
can lead to the waiving of the CPSA's restrictions and result in the
provision of military education, training, and nonlethal supplies.

[Although]{.underline} a [potentially powerful]{.underline} tool, [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has not consistently
leveraged]{.mark} the [Act's utility]{.mark} to send a strong and clear
message against the use of child soldiers. Instead, [Washington]{.mark}
has [invoked]{.mark} the [Act's waiver authority]{.mark}]{.underline}
more [[often]{.underline}]{.mark} than not [to provide full and partial
waivers to countries with known records of child soldier
use.]{.underline} For example, between 2012 and 2014, the State
Department identified the DRC, South Sudan, and Yemen as having
recruited and used children in armed conflict. However, the
administration has consistently provided waivers to the prohibitions
warranted by the CSPA that would otherwise limit U.S. military
assistance to these countries.

In some cases, [these waivers amount to millions of dollars in military
assistance. This year, Somalia might receive upwards of \$115 million in
sanctionable assistance that would otherwise be prohibited by the
CSPA.]{.underline} Yemen could have access to at least \$26 million that
would also be prohibited under the terms of the Act. These provisions of
assistance stand in contrast to conditions on the ground, where child
recruitment by government-supported armed groups in Yemen has increased
and 200 children are believed to have been recruited by the Somali
national army and allied militias in 2013 alone.

Grounds for Optimism?

[In other parts of the world, explicit action like the CSPA is even
rarer.]{.underline} Belgium, for example, has legislation that prohibits
the export and transit of arms to countries that use child soldiers in
their national armies. However, [most states have yet to develop
regulations that respond to the established connection between arms
transfers and the use of child soldiers.]{.underline} The new Arms Trade
Treaty might be one vehicle that governments can use to fill that void.
Because children are at risk of being recruited and used by government
forces, paramilitaries, and other armed groups, efforts to condition
arms transfers must be broader in scope.

Globally, [[measures like]{.mark} the [CSPA could be used to]{.mark}
mitigate and ultimately **[end the use of child soldiers]{.mark}** in
national militaries and government-supported armed groups.]{.underline}
It, along with similar measures, should be considered within a larger,
coordinated context to support sustainable institutions and security
apparatuses in emerging democracies. [The [implementation of arms
and]{.mark} assistance **[prohibitions]{.mark}** [should complement
**democracy promotion** and security]{.mark} sector
[reform]{.mark}]{.underline}. Prohibitions can and should be linked to
the signing and implementation of national action plans focused on
demobilizing and ending recruitment of child soldiers. In short, [[these
measures]{.mark} can be used to [encourage changes in government
behavior]{.mark} and [to **promote democratic norms**]{.mark} within the
military structure that do not rely on the use of child
soldiers.]{.underline}

#### Liberal democracy solves global nuclear war

Claire **Berlinski 18**, Ph.D. international relations from Oxford
University, 7/15/18, "Europe's Dependence on the U.S. Was All Part of
the Plan,"
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/15/trump-nato-europe-history-dependence-219011

What Trump fails to understand is that the [disparity in spending, with
[the U.S.]{.mark} paying more than its allies, is **not a bug** of the
system. It is a **feature**]{.underline}. [This is how the great
[postwar]{.mark} statesmen designed it, and this immensely foresighted
[strategy]{.mark} has **[ensured]{.mark} the [absence of great power
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[and]{.underline} **[nuclear
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}---for three-quarters of a century.

[The]{.underline} open, [liberal world order we know today was
built]{.underline} in the wake of World War II and expanded after the
collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it is led [by the **U**nited
**S**tates; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military hegemony over
Eurasia]{.underline} while uniting Europe under the U.S.' protection.
[[The goal]{.mark} of this American grand strategy is to **[prevent any
single power from dominating]{.mark} the region**]{.underline} [and
turning on the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies. [American hegemony
serves]{.mark}, too, [to quell]{.mark} previously intractable **regional
[rivalries]{.mark}**[, preventing]{.mark} further **[world
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Dean Acheson, George Marshall and the other
great statesmen of their generation pursued this strategy because they
had learned, at unimaginable cost, that the eternal American fantasy of
forever being free of Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in
other words---was just that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American
men lost their lives in the European theaters of the First and Second
World Wars. (American fatalities in all of the other 20th-century
conflicts---including Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total
one-quarter of that number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor
incompetent. They were the architects of the greatest foreign policy
triumph in U.S. history.

[So successful was this policy that Americans now]{.underline}---most of
whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of these wars---[see
**peace**, **unity**, **prosperity** and **stability** as Europe's
natural state. This is an illusion]{.underline}. [For centuries, Europe
was the **fulcrum of global violence**]{.underline}. With the age of
global exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of violence,
the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with
improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the
division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in
point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the
representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to
Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for
several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their
exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King Léopold
II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten
million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations.

In recognizing this history of blood, however, [we must recognize
something equally true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy
saw its fullest realization in the West. This flourishing of
**peace**]{.underline} [and **human rights**]{.underline} [cannot be
explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism]{.underline}.
(Consider the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President
Dwight Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) [It happened
because]{.underline} during World War II, [Europe destroyed itself,
leaving the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} [overwhelmingly powerful
by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Through the
application of economic, diplomatic and military force majeure, the
United States suppressed Europe's internal security competition. This is
why postwar Europe ceased to be the world's leading exporter of violence
and became, instead, the world's leading exporter of luxury sedans.

Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised it, could have
pacified and unified Europe under its aegis. No other continental
country possessed half the world's GDP. No other country had enough
distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large extent, by all parties
and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No other country had a
strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that its inhabitants
could be persuaded gladly to share.

Indeed, Europeans cooperated with the U.S. program because it created
conditions under which both the United States and Europe flourished. The
United States assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13
billion of aid in the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars,
roughly \$113 billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that
would become the European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S.
security umbrella with the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its
most important element, declares that an attack on one member of NATO is
an attack on all members. These policies were intended not only to
counter the Soviet Union, but to condition Europe's prosperity upon its
integration into a single market, with free movement of goods, capital
and labor. The founders of these institutions fully intended them to be
the foundations of a United States of Europe, much like the United
States of America. Profound economic interdependence, they believed,
would make further European wars impossible.

At the same time, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [built an
open]{.mark}, global [order]{.mark} upon an architecture of specific
institutions: [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[N]{.mark}**ations, the
**[I]{.mark}**nternational **[M]{.mark}**onetary **[F]{.mark}**und
[and]{.mark} the **[I]{.mark}**nternational **[C]{.mark}**ourt of
**[J]{.mark}**ustice]{.underline}. This order is in many respects an
empire---[a [Pax Americana]{.mark}]{.underline}---but it [[is more
humane than any empire that preceded]{.mark} it, with institutions that
are intended to **benefit all parties**]{.underline}. Postwar U.S.
statesmen believed that prosperous, liberal democracies that traded
freely with each other would neither go to war with each other nor the
United States. [They [ascribed]{.mark},]{.underline} in other words,
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the so-called [**[D]{.mark}**emocratic
**[P]{.mark}**eace **[t]{.mark}**heory]{.underline}---[[a theory with
**overwhelming empirical support**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The U.S. military was always an integral part of the plan to unite and
rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II, U.S. troops have
been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot be dominated by
a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and turning them
against the U.S. [The **U**nited **S**tates has built overwhelmingly
massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they
begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection
that there is no need to begin local arms races]{.underline}, for their
safety is guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility
of its promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in
turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin
Airlift, when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet
blockade, was precisely such a display.) In return for the United
States' commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America's dominant role in
the international system.

In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought
to undermine the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because the
Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West under the United
States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda organs cranked into
overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example, published in Isvestia
in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a
fat capitalist bent on destroying the sovereignty of European nations.
The French paper L\'Humanité, which reliably parroted Moscow's line,
wrote, "After disorganizing the national economies of the countries
which are under the American yoke, American leaders now intend
conclusively to subjugate the economy of these countries to their own
interests."

The Soviet Union's criticism of the Marshall Plan and other American
involvement in Europe was eerily similar to the language Russia's now
uses in its campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and
tropes of Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly or
unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and other antiliberal politicians,
parties and movements throughout the West. With the men who built the
postwar world order now in their graves, and the memory of carnage and
horror buried with them, a very sizable constituency of Americans has
forgotten that their country built this system for a reason---that the
United States does not maintain its alliances as an act of foolish
largesse. The loudest exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting
rolled, that the European Union was "created to destroy us," and that
multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization assault
the "sovereignty" of the nations concerned is, unfortunately, the
president of the United States.

It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are.
[History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is
never so cooperative. Global free **trade sustains modern economic
life**]{.underline}. An interruption to this trade---carried out chiefly
on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S. military---would bring
modern life to an end. [[The Second World War proved]{.mark} not only
that [isolationism]{.mark} and [American-Firstism were
fantasies]{.mark}, but exceptionally childish and **dangerous
ones**]{.underline}, at that. [[In the age]{.mark} of hyperglobalized
[trade]{.mark}, international air travel, [the
internet,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [and
**i**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nter**[c]{.mark}**ontinental
**[b]{.mark}**allistic **[m]{.mark}**issile**[s]{.mark}**,
[these]{.mark} fantasies [are]{.mark}]{.underline} even more childish
and [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. may be on another
continent, but it is not on another planet.

It is true that the U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was
always part of the deal. [The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight
a war anywhere in the world, invade any country]{.underline} at will,
[and]{.underline} (at least in theory) [fight multiple simultaneous
major wars]{.underline}---[even in space]{.underline}. Of course this
costs more. [It is in America's advantage to be the only power on the
planet that can do this]{.underline}.

Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage for other
countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do. Europe is
America's biggest export market, as designed. We want Europeans to spend
their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not razing Flanders to the
ground yet again.

Yet Trump's refusal to deter our shared enemies and protect our allies
risks provoking a regional European arms race---exactly what the U.S.
has sought to avoid for 74 years. It is an invitation to adventurism
from Putin. Trump's refusal to adopt the encouraging language of past
presidents toward European integration, language that until now has been
transformed into policy by professional and experienced State Department
employees, puts further strain on an already-weakened Europe. Above all,
Trump's overt support for sordid, Kremlin-backed actors who seek to
undermine Europe's unity is unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's
interest, or in ours, for the American president to lend the United
States' prestige and support to Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal
Marxists, populists, authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists,
particularly since all of them are ideologically hostile to the United
States?

The damage Trump has deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability comes
at a uniquely dangerous time. [Democracy's so-called third
wave]{.underline}---the global blossoming of open political systems
after the Cold War---[has long since receded. A threat to liberal
democracy, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology]{.underline}---**[[illiberal
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[is ascendant]{.underline}]{.mark}.
We see it today in Russia and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic,
kleptocratic and hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates
itself through the new technologies of the 21st century.

[The global order the U.S. built was based on the principle that
[only]{.mark} a world of **[liberal democracies can be peaceful]{.mark}
and prosperous**. That principle is **correct**]{.underline}.
[[Should]{.mark} the [unraveling of the]{.mark} order the [U.S.]{.mark}
built [proceed]{.mark} at this pace, **[the world will]{.mark} soon [be
neither peaceful nor prosperous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Nor]{.mark}
will [the effects]{.mark} be [confined]{.mark} to regions distant from
the United States. [America will feel them]{.mark} gradually, and
then]{.underline}, probably, **[[overnight]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[in
the form of a **devastating, sudden shock**]{.underline}.

Charles de Gaulle believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long
term, be trusted with French security. It led him to withdraw France
from NATO's military integrated command and launch an independent
nuclear development program. The independent nuclear program was real,
but the withdrawal from NATO wasn't---a secret agreement kept France in
NATO anyway. But, today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the
costs and benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the
risks and rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de
Gaulle is saying from the grave, I told you so.

[The American-led world order, undergirded by the ideal of [liberal
democracy, has been]{.mark} highly **[imperfect]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [it has been the closest thing to Utopia our
fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits
are]{.underline} not just economic, although those benefits are
**[immense]{.underline}**. [Its [benefits must be **measured in wars not
fought**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [lives not squandered.]{.underline}

#### The affirmative recognizes child soldiers as a security concern which establishes a model for navigating the human rights, military conflicts 

Rachel **Stohl 18**, managing director and directs the Conventional
Defense program at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, 2-12-2018, \"Child
Soldiers Pose a National Security Threat\", National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/child-soldiers-pose-national-security-threat-24470

[Tens of thousands of children continue to be used in conflicts around
the world]{.underline}, with many used as child soldiers or in
combat-support roles. Indeed, a brief snapshot of the numbers tells a
grim story. [In South Sudan]{.underline}, the United Nations estimates
that [more than nineteen thousand children have been used as child
soldiers in the country's civil war since 2013]{.underline}. More than
two thousand children have been recruited by Boko Haram [in Nigeria in
2016 alone and they have been increasingly used as "human
bombs]{.underline}." [In Yemen]{.underline}, the UN has documented [more
than 1,700 children]{.underline} who [have been recruited]{.underline}
since March 2015 [to fight in the]{.underline} ongoing [civil
war]{.underline}.

For years, [this issue has prompted numerous calls for pragmatic
approaches to mitigate and ultimately prevent the future use of child
soldiers]{.underline}. Yet many efforts, particularly those aimed at
modifying national policies and implementing legislation, are stymied at
the start because [the]{.underline} recruitment and [use of child
soldiers is viewed narrowly as a human-rights concern, rather
than]{.underline} an issue that holds both [human security and
national-security implications.]{.underline} These two things are not
mutually exclusive.

With sustained conflicts and the continued use of children to wage wars,
it is time to reframe the discussion on child soldiers and better
emphasize the security challenges presented by the exploitation of
children in conflict---both for the conflicts' duration and the
long-term impacts of those that come into contact with child soldiers.

The recruitment and use of child soldiers are not crimes of desperation
or opportunity, but represent a deliberate strategic process to sustain
conflict. [[Child soldiers are]{.mark} often [seen as expendable]{.mark}
and replenishable]{.underline}, and do not require significant training
or investment. And although [children in conflict]{.underline} are
unlikely to change the tempo of warfare or provide significant strategic
advantage to one side or another, they [can sustain conflict and fulfill
much-needed positions such as porters, spies, cooks and
combatants]{.underline}---thus extending the length and lethality of
conflicts and sustaining conditions that perpetuate the conflict's
continuation. It is therefore important to frame policy discussions to
attend to the perceived strategic incentives (and disincentives) of
using children in conflict, and identify effective ways to ultimately
end the recruitment and use of child soldiers.

To combat the reliance on children as tools of warfare, governments can
train military leaders on the risks and inefficiencies of relying on
children to fight their wars. The Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative,
run by former Canadian Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, who served as the force
commander for the UN Mission in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, has
taken such an approach to eradicate the use of child soldiers. The
initiative works with governments to implement trainings that educate
military leaders on the dangers and pitfalls of using child soldiers, as
well as inform them of the international legal frameworks that protect
children from exploitation in armed conflict. The initiative also aims
to adapt military doctrine to better help national armed forces prepare
for the possibility of confronting children in combat. In March 2017,
Canada became the first country to adopt such a doctrine.

Governments can also leverage military assistance to dissuade foreign
militaries from recruiting and using children in combat. To date, very
few countries have linked these issues and implemented national
legislation that conditions arms sales and military assistance on a
country's record of using or supporting the use of child soldiers. Such
initiatives have been undertaken by Belgium, Switzerland and the United
States to augment broader efforts to get children off the battlefield.
Although the conversation on child soldiers often falls off
national-security agendas---or to a lower-tier priority---there are
numerous opportunities to enhance efforts to prevent and ultimately end
the recruitment and use of children in combat.

[In the United States, one such effort is [the Child Soldiers Prevention
Act (CSPA),]{.mark} which [seeks to]{.mark} encourage countries to
[stop]{.mark} recruiting and [using child soldiers]{.mark} by
[leveraging]{.mark} U.S. [security assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Under the CSPA, countries identified by the State Department as using
or supporting the use of child soldiers **are prohibited from receiving
U.S. weapons and certain types of military assistance**, unless they
receive a waiver from the president. **[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has invoked]{.mark} such [national-interest
waivers]{.mark} more often than not**]{.underline}, however, and allowed
nearly \$1.7 billion in military assistance to flow to thirteen
countries known to use/support the use of child soldiers since the CSPA
was enacted---thereby effectively giving a pass to governments that
routinely exploit children in their national militaries or
government-supported armed groups.

[[What is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only [[broader]{.mark} application and [implementation of the
CSPA]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also potential reframing of the broader
issues surrounding the recruitment and use of child soldiers so as to
better prepare U.S. military personnel for situations in which they may
encounter children in combat roles. This includes awareness raising in
advance of operations that may encounter child soldiers, as well as
post-deployment counseling to deal with the aftermath of engagement with
children in conflict.

The United States could also adopt bureaucratic changes to address the
use of child soldiers. While the United States is not Canada, and it
plays a different role in military operations around the world, an
adapted Canada doctrine may be appropriate for the U.S. military.
Regardless, the United States needs to expand the range of stakeholders
engaged in these discussions and incorporate the issue into engagement
and operation planning to deal with the situation of encountering child
soldiers on the ground and better address the psychological aftermath of
military engagement with young children.

Further, the United States can work with other countries, particularly
those that are military-assistance donors, to establish additional
protections for children in conflict. This can mean working with
governments to implement their own legislation to condition their
military relationships on stopping the use of child soldiers. Such an
approach can also include awareness of---and support for---groups and
organizations working on child soldier reintegration and prevention so
that the most vulnerable children are protected from re-recruitment.

[[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and other governments must
recognize that the issue of child soldiers is a **security
concern**]{.mark}---[not just a moral and ethical dilemma. Changing the
way that governments]{.mark} and militaries [talk about]{.mark} the
issue of [child soldiers will allow a wider variety of actors to engage
in]{.mark} more [**creative** and **effective solutions** that]{.mark}
could put a [stop]{.mark} to [this]{.mark} horrific [practice while
protecting national-security interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Linkage of human rights promotion in security policy solves global war

William W. **Burke-White 04**, Lecturer in Public and International
Affairs and Senior Special Assistant to the Dean, Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Spring 2004,
Harvard Human Rights Journal, 17 Harv. Hum. Rts. J. 249, p. 279-280

This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed to ideological or
normative\--argument that the [[promotion of **human rights** should
be]{.mark} given a more [prominent]{.mark} place [in U.S. foreign
policy]{.mark}. It does so by suggesting a correlation between the
domestic human rights practices of states and their propensity to engage
in **aggressive international conduct**]{.underline}. Among the chief
threats to U.S. national security are acts of aggression by other
states. Aggressive acts of war may directly endanger the United States,
as did the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, or they may require
U.S. military action overseas, as in Kuwait fifty years later. Evidence
from the post-Cold War period \[\*250\] indicates that [[states
that]{.mark} **systematically [abuse]{.mark}** their own
[citizens\']{.mark} human rights [are]{.mark} also those [most likely to
engage in **aggression**]{.mark}. To the degree that
[improvements]{.mark} in various states\' human rights records
**[decrease the likelihood of aggressive war]{.mark}**, a foreign
[policy informed by human rights can]{.mark} significantly [enhance U.S.
and global security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since 1990, [a state\'s domestic human rights policy appears to be a
telling indicator of that state\'s **propensity to engage in
international aggression**]{.underline}. [A central element of U.S.
foreign policy has long been the **preservation of peace**]{.underline}
[and the **prevention** of such acts of **aggression**]{.underline}. n2
If [[the correlation]{.mark} discussed herein]{.underline} is accurate,
it [[provides]{.mark} U.S. policymakers with [a]{.mark} powerful new
[tool to **enhance**]{.mark} **national [security through]{.mark} the
[promotion of human rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A [[strategic
linkage]{.mark} [between]{.mark} national [security and human rights
would result in]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of important policy
modifications. [First]{.underline}, it changes [the [prioritization
of]{.mark} those [countries]{.mark} U.S. policymakers have identified as
[presenting the greatest concern]{.mark}. Second]{.underline}, it alters
some of the [policy prescriptions for such states]{.underline}.
[Third,]{.underline} [[it offers states a means of **signaling**
benign]{.mark} international [intent through]{.mark} the [improvement
of]{.mark} their domestic [human rights]{.mark} records]{.underline}.
Fourth, [[it provides a way for a current government to **prevent future
governments from aggressive**]{.mark} **international
[behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[through]{.mark} the
[**institutionalization** of **human rights
protections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fifth, [[it addresses the]{.mark}
particular [threat of human rights abusing states obtaining]{.mark}
weapons of mass destruction [(WMD)]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, it
offers a mechanism for U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

#### Neglecting child soldiers hurts credibility\-\--the plan shows leadership in the fight against human trafficking and exploitation

[This week the U.S. Government released its annual Trafficking in
Persons (TIP) Report.]{.underline} This thorough report is a shining
example of U.S. global leadership in the fight against modern day
slavery around the world and in the US.

[The report is a critical diplomatic tool to engage countries and enable
them to improve their own fight against trafficking.]{.underline} It
also makes it possible to go beyond words: If a country is in the lowest
tiered ranking, sanctions can be applied. A lot of ink and bandwidth
will focus on the U.S. TIP report this week and what the U.S. and
countries around the world are doing \-- or are not doing \-- in the
fight against modern day slaxvery.

Yet [[buried in the TIP Report]{.underline}]{.mark}, there is one page
that is often unnoticed. It [[is]{.mark} a list of countries found to be
using children in their national armies or in government-supported
paramilitary groups. [The]{.mark}]{.underline} Child Soldier Prevention
Act ([[CSPA]{.underline}]{.mark}) of 2008 requires the annual TIP Report
to include this list. But this year the list is more tragic than in
years past, because the number of countries using child soldiers
increased from seven in 2012 to 10 in 2013.

This is the first time since the passage of the CSPA in 2009 that the
number of countries on the list has gone up. The 10 countries are
Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Myanmar, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Of those ten countries, the U.S. government gives military aid to seven
of them: Chad, DRC, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen, and now the
Syrian opposition. That means [[U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent on
armies that use children.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The CSPA says that any country receiving U.S. military aid and found to
be using children in its armed forces will lose key forms of that aid,
except that which can help countries demobilize and transition children
out of their national armies. Over the past three years, President Obama
has issued waivers or partial waivers to all countries that receive U.S.
military aid.

[The intent of the law is to use the waiver authority only in extreme
circumstances. Instead, waivers have become the default reaction of this
administration and thus our best tool is being kept unused in the
toolbox.]{.underline}

When you keep your best tool in the tool box, it gets rusty and useless.
[These countries need support to help end the widespread use of child
soldiers and change takes time.]{.underline} Nevertheless, they continue
to exploit children in their militaries, and [[the United States refuses
to show the will necessary to enforce the law]{.mark} that took effect
just three years ago.]{.underline} If the U.S. government is going to
put pressure on countries like Russia and China as seen in this year\'s
TIP Report, why would it not pressure governments using children to
fight for them?

[The United Nations has set a deadline of 2016 for all countries to stop
recruiting and using children to fight in the military.]{.underline} So
far the UN has signed Action Plans to accomplish that goal with each of
the violating countries listed in the TIP Report. However, Action Plans
are just words on paper. [If we are going to realize the goal of
stopping the use of children as weapons of war, then the U.S. needs to
actually use its leadership and the tools we have at our
disposal.]{.underline}

They\'ve already taken a step with DRC. Just this week Secretary Kerry
appointed former Senator Russ Feingold as the new Special Envoy to the
Great Lakes region of Africa. Senator Feingold was an original supporter
of the CSPA and his engagement in the region will mean a great deal for
the work in Rwanda and DRC. Now [[it\'s time for the U.S. to be]{.mark}
just as [strategic with the other countries on the
list.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In Syria, the TIP Report points out that the Syrian army and the
opposition are using children as fighters, porters, and even
executioners. What\'s more, there are now nearly six million refugee and
internally displaced people from Syria and many of them are children.

As a recent report from the Child Soldier Initiative points out, the
likelihood a child will be forcibly recruited to fight in an armed group
increases dramatically if that child is a refugee or internally
displaced. It\'s a likelihood that\'s all too real for Raed and
thousands of children just like him. [[The U.S. continues to show its
leadership in fighting human trafficking when it comes to sexual and
labor exploitation. It\'s time for the U.S. government to do the
same]{.mark} thing [for children used as weapons of
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: No Leadership Spillover

#### Human rights promotion bolsters American leadership and credibility 

Aryeh **Neier 19** Founder of HRW and ACLU director, Jan 30/19 To
presidential candidates drafting platforms: Restore U.S. Human Rights
Leadership
https://www.justsecurity.org/62420/presidential-candidates-drafting-platforms-restore-u-s-human-rights-leadership/

As the number of candidates running for president rapidly expands, some
of them undoubtedly are formulating their foreign policy goals. One
important component of any platform, along with protecting national
security and advancing America's economic interests, should be to
[[restore the United States' commitment to promote human rights]{.mark}
internationally. Doing so [would enhance America's global prestige and
advance other U.S. foreign policy concerns.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This would be a stark contrast to President Donald Trump's foreign
policy. To the extent that there is a consistent theme in Trump's
approach to world affairs, it has been to heap praise on extreme
nationalist leaders and dictators, including Rodrigo Duterte of the
Philippines, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Kim Jong Un of North Korea,
Viktor Orbán of Hungary, and Vladimir Putin of Russia. All the while, he
expresses disdain for leaders like Canada's Justin Trudeau and Germany's
Angela Merkel, who have taken strong stands for human rights.

The Trump administration's withdrawal of recognition from Nicolás Maduro
in Venezuela is a welcome exception, should it secure a peaceful
transition in cooperation with democratic countries in the region.

[The first step those seeking to defeat Trump in 2020 should take in
[devising an effective human rights policy is to restore the credibility
of the United States as a proponent of the cause.]{.mark} This can be
done only by addressing civil and human rights issues in the United
States, which capture a great deal of attention in other
countries.]{.underline}

The experience of President George W. Bush is instructive. [Bush seemed
committed to the promotion of human rights internationally, but his
accomplishments in this area were negligible. His administration
undercut its rhetoric and policy goals by putting into practice the very
abuses it railed against, including the long-term detention of hundreds
of men at Guantanamo without trials or even charges, and the torture of
detainees at secret CIA prisons around the world.]{.underline} Those
events and policies made it impossible to promote human rights and
persuade other governments to take seriously American criticism of their
human rights practices.

\`Muslim Ban,' Family Separation, Mass Incarceration

In the case of the Trump administration, its Muslim Ban and
family-separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border have attracted a
great deal of negative attention in other parts of the world. Major
changes in these practices are needed if the United States is to be
taken seriously when it speaks to other countries about their human
rights abuses. A sustained and substantial effort to reduce mass
incarceration also would demonstrate that the United States is intent on
itself manifesting respect for human rights.

[[If the next president re-establishes U.S. credibility as an advocate
for human rights, she or he could then focus on efforts to promote
rights globally.]{.mark} The first thing to do is to stand up for
freedom of the press. The imprisonment and killing of journalists not
only violates journalists' rights, but also does great damage to the
freedoms of everyone else whose rights are threatened.]{.underline}

All of us need a free press to let the world know when we are under
attack. Without a free press, we cannot get protection when we need it.
Labeling journalists as "the enemy of the people" is an assault on
everyone's rights. Protecting journalists should be at the top of the
agenda for an American human rights policy.

Second, the next president should take steps to mitigate the harm to
civilians in armed conflicts. The United States should focus attention
on the use of chemical weapons and barrel bombs by the Assad regime in
Syria; the indiscriminate attacks by Saudi air strikes and by the Houthi
rebels in Yemen; the burning of Rohingya villages in Myanmar; and other
such practices that kill and injure noncombatants. The victims of armed
conflicts also include many women and girls, and also men and boys, who
are the targets of sexual attacks by combatants.

The one place where victims can seek justice and accountability is the
International Criminal Court. But the Trump administration is working to
undercut the ICC. Last year, John Bolton, Trump's national security
advisor, delivered a speech trashing the ICC, calling it "ineffective,
unaccountable...outright dangerous," especially to the United States.
Strengthening international mechanisms such as the ICC to hold
accountable those who commit war crimes should be a high priority for
the next president.

Third, a major focus of an international human rights policy should be
the development of procedures for sharing the burden of caring humanely
for and resettling large numbers of people forced to flee their own
countries by armed conflict, persecution, or climate change. No single
country can cope with this problem on its own. It requires global
cooperation. In the absence of American leadership, however, it is hard
to imagine that such cooperation is possible.

Countering Abuses by China and Russia

Finally, an American human rights policy should include specific
measures to counter abuses by China and Russia. Under Xi Jinping, who
has abolished term limits on his rule, China is reverting to its
totalitarian past. The imprisonment of hundreds of human rights lawyers
and the detention and forcible re-education of about a million members
of the Uighur minority in remote western China are examples of what is
happening under Xi's rule.

As for Russia, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, it not only
violates the rights of its own citizens but also is responsible for
severe abuses outside Russia's borders, as in Ukraine and Syria. It will
not be easy to devise a policy that has an impact on human rights abuses
committed by Xi and Putin. Yet, a good beginning would be for the next
U.S. president to use her or his unrivaled capacity to command world
attention to speak out about these abuses.

What results might we expect to achieve by restoring America's
commitment to promoting human rights internationally? The honest answer
is that our expectations should be modest. Dramatic consequences in the
short-term are unlikely. [Governments that commit gross abuse of human
rights often ignore denunciations until it is evident that they will pay
a price if they do not modify their practices.]{.underline}

[Over time, other governments will make common cause with the United
States in such efforts, and [international institutions designed to
promote rights for all of us would be substantially
strengthened.]{.mark} What's more, [if the United States were again
known]{.mark} not only for its military and economic power but also [for
the power that comes with a commitment to human rights for all, it would
win]{.mark} our country [many friends and incalculably bolster our
global credibility and influence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Though many governments today are led by xenophobic nationalists (and
the concept of an open society is under assault in too many places, even
here in the United States), in much of the world there is also a higher
level of popular support for human rights norms such as freedom of
expression, racial and gender equality, judicial fairness and
independence, and individual dignity than ever before. If the next
president of the United States commits to placing compliance with -- and
promotion of -- these norms at the forefront of American foreign policy,
it will serve the United States -- and the rest of the world.

### AT: CSPA Can't Work

#### The CSPA could be a powerful tool but waivers undermine effectiveness 

**Child Soldiers International 18,** UK-based non-governmental
organization that works to prevent the recruitment, use and exploitation
of children by armed forces and groups. 3/1/18, Why are American taxes
funding child soldiers?
<https://www.child-soldiers.org/news/why-are-american-taxes-funding-child-soldiers>
Hale

Right now, an estimated 300,000 children globally are being robbed of
childhoods. They do not go to school. They don't spend their days
playing with friends. Many no longer see their families.

[These hundreds of thousands of children are soldiers]{.underline}, and
they are [fighting on the front lines of some of the world's most deadly
conflicts.]{.underline}

Across parts of North Africa, the Middle East and Asia, [children are
frequently recruited---or kidnapped---and forced to fight.]{.underline}
According to Human Rights Watch, [[they are frequently]{.mark} sexually
abused and are often subjected to some of the harshest conditions and
most dangerous missions---including being [used as **human
shields.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In 2008, the United States decided to take dramatic measures to prevent
the spread of the use of child soldiers.]{.underline} As part of the
William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act
of 2008---named for the famous British Christian abolitionist
responsible for the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act of 1807---Congress
passed the Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA). [It was a revolutionary
piece of legislation that placed real consequences on countries preying
on the most vulnerable.]{.underline}

The law says that no country that uses child soldiers may receive U.S.
military aid.

The intention of the law is twofold: Primarily, [it attempts to serve as
a deterrent from using child soldiers]{.underline}---after all, the U.S.
spends billions assisting other countries in a variety of military
campaigns across the world. But [the law also ensures that American
taxpayer money isn't used for buying weapons or equipment that will end
up in the hands of children forced to fight in conflicts around the
globe.]{.underline}

In theory, [the law strikes a major blow to the recruitment of child
soldiers.]{.underline}

But starting in 2010 under [President [Obama and]{.mark}]{.underline} as
recently as September 2017 under [President [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline},
the United States government has done something that's flown under the
radar of many activists fighting to end child slavery:
[[**intentionally** ignored]{.underline}]{.mark} its own
[[law]{.underline}]{.mark}. R MAR-APR 060 2018

As a result, [American taxpayer money is currently supporting the use of
child soldiers in several countries, and the highest levels of Congress,
the State Department and White House all know about it.]{.underline}

A Dangerous Precedent

Every year, the State Department issues the "Trafficking in Persons
Report," a document that tracks human trafficking, slavery, the use of
child soldiers and other human rights violations across the world. The
report itself says it "is the U.S. Government's principal diplomatic
tool to engage foreign governments on human trafficking."

The reason why it could be so effective in preventing these types of
abuses is because of the potential, significant consequences for
countries that violate human rights. Within the report each year is a
list of countries the State Department has identified "as having
governmental armed forces or government-supported armed groups that
recruit and use child soldiers[." If a country lands on the report, that
means, according to the law, they should not receive any military
support from the United States.]{.underline} Currently, eight
countries---Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia,
South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen---are on the list.

"In theory, under \[the CSPA\], the U.S. government is supposed to be
able to block military aid that otherwise would have gone to the states
on the basis of their child recruitment," explains Tim Molyneux, the
Child Rights Program Manager at Child Soldiers International, an
international advocacy group that works to end the use of child
soldiers.

Molyneux says [that [the CSPA could be a powerful **tool** to **end
child slavery**]{.mark}, however, he says, "[The law has never really
been used to its full effect.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

One of the major flaws of the law is that [it grants a single
person]{.underline}---the sitting president--- [the authority to issue
waivers to any country that uses child soldiers if it is deemed to be in
the U.S.'s "national interest" to do so.]{.underline} And since 2008,
nearly all of the penalties meant to be levied on countries that use
child soldiers have been waived.

At times, Molyneux says, partially waiving these penalties, can make
sense. "We have sometimes recommended the use of partial waivers tied
very much to efforts to reduce recruitments of children and to
prioritize initiatives that are seeking to do that," he says. In other
words, if a country is making significant strides in reducing the use of
child soldiers, Molyneux suggests that not entirely withholding military
support might be appropriate. But in the last decade, both Trump and
Obama have issued wide-ranging waivers via executive order.

[During Obama's time, [almost all of the restrictions were
waived]{.mark}, Molyneux says. And though Trump hasn't issued waivers as
broadly, he, too, has given most of the countries on the list a
pass.]{.underline}

Part of the problem is the idea of "national interest" is so broad. Many
of the countries on the list use U.S. military support to fight radical
Islamic insurgencies.

[In the view of the president, even if those governments are using child
soldiers to fight the terrorists, it may be in the "interest" of the
U.S. to essentially ignore our own law.]{.underline}

But it also implicates the United States---and its taxpayers---in their
recruitment.

"U.S. military aid is obviously this really broad term that applies to
all kinds of material aid that the U.S. might give to another country,"
Molyneux says. "So it might include arms sales and equipment sales and
literally, you know, giving guns to other countries. Militaries that use
child soldiers or \[use children for\] training or support for
peacekeeping operations and so on and so forth ... In many cases, we're
not actually talking about arms sales, it may just be training and other
stuff."

But no matter what the military assistance functionally looks like in
individual countries, [[by ignoring the CSPA]{.mark} by [issuing
waivers]{.mark} to governments that knowingly recruit child soldiers,
[the purpose of the law is defeated]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Because of the [waivers]{.mark}]{.underline} issued by President Trump,
this year [the eight countries the U.S. State Department says use child
soldiers will receive \$140 million in U.S. military
assistance.]{.underline} That's money the law says they shouldn't be
able to have.

The Silent Scandal

"The decision is inconsistent with U.S. law." "This decision
[[compromise]{.mark}s **[U.S. credibility."]{.mark}**]{.underline} "[The
decision [undermines]{.mark} the \[State\] Department's [work and harms
children]{.mark}."]{.underline}

These surprisingly blunt statements are three headings of a memo the
public was never meant to see.

Officially marked "Not for Further Circulation," the memo was leaked to
reporters last fall and offered a concerning look at how the U.S. is now
addressing child soldiers.

The document is a "dissent memo," a vehicle for officials to raise
concerns about actions within the State Department without risking
losing their jobs. It made it all the way to the desk of Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson before being leaked to the press.

Weeks earlier, Tillerson took an entirely unprecedented step of
personally deciding that three countries---Afghanistan, Burma and
Iraq---should be left off of CSPA entirely, despite recommendations from
State Department officials and intelligence gathered by the department
itself.

A representative for Tillerson said he made the decision for "technical"
reasons, though his decision may actually be a direct violation of the
law.

As the memo reads: "All relevant bureaus, offices and embassies agreed
that there was sufficient information to establish that Afghanistan,
Burma and Iraq had governmental armed forces or government-supported
armed groups that recruited or used child soldiers ... Based on those
facts, it is difficult to defend the decision not to list those
countries as a legal matter."

But even more concerning than the legal implications of Tillerson's move
is what it could mean for children.

The memo continues, "[[It has risked sending a message]{.mark} to the
authorities in all three countries---and to the international
community---that minimal efforts are enough; [that we]{.mark} as a
government [are **not interested** in upholding international norms, nor
in holding countries accountable for **ongoing abuses against
children**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}"

A few days after Tillerson's decision, [a horrific campaign of ethnic
cleansing broke out in Burma, with the Rohingya community suffering mass
rape, executions and displacement.]{.underline}

#### Adding Saudi Arabia to the list boosts international credibility \-\-- Pompeo ruined credibility on the issue by denying facts

Michelle **Kosinski 6/19** senior diplomatic correspondent responsible
for covering the State Department et. al, 6/19/19, Pompeo overrules
experts, keeps Saudi Arabia off US child soldiers list,
<https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/saudi-arabia-child-soldiers-report-pompeo/index.html>
Jon

Washington (CNN)[Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo decided not to include
Saudi Arabia on the]{.mark} State Department\'s [list of countries that
recruit child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} and [overruled his own team
of experts, who argued that there was sufficient evidence to do
so]{.underline}, a source familiar with the issue told CNN.

While the State Department is legally required to list all countries
that use child soldiers, [discussions about whether to include Saudi
Arabia in the soon-to-be released report [sparked]{.mark} a fierce
[internal debate]{.mark} between State Department officials and in-house
experts.]{.underline}

Reuters was first to report the disagreement and Pompeo\'s decision to
leave Saudi Arabia off the list.

A source familiar with the internal discussions told CNN that the State
Department\'s experts on human trafficking recommended that the
department include Saudi Arabia, in part, due to reports that [the
kingdom was using child soldiers from Sudan to fight for the US-backed
coalition in Yemen \-- a claim they said was corroborated by a military
source.]{.underline}

Yet despite acknowledging that there are child soldiers fighting in
Yemen, some [[State Department officials]{.mark} claimed that the
evidence fell short of proving they were being led by Saudi commanders
and pushed back on the experts\' recommendation to include the kingdom
on the list.]{.underline}

The source conceded that the decision was a very close call, adding that
one could indeed argue there was not sufficient evidence, but the office
that handles this issue felt there was enough to support its
recommendation.

The State Department responded with only a brief statement to CNN: \"The
United States condemns the unlawful recruitment and use of child
soldiers. We place great importance on ending the practice.\"

Saudi policy under scrutiny

News of the heated disagreement comes as Congress continues to question
the Trump administration\'s policy on Saudi Arabia.

Despite bipartisan criticism over the kingdom\'s war in Yemen and its
role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the White House has
sought an even closer relationship with the Saudis, as is evident by its
push to sell them billions of dollars in weapons and munitions despite
opposition in Congress.

Those concerns have only been amplified by the Trump administration\'s
recent push to counter Iran and its view of Saudi Arabia as a key player
in that effort.

On Wednesday, Rep. Tom Malinowski, a Democrat from New Jersey, accused
Pompeo of [[intentionally misleading the public about Saudi Arabia\'s
use of child soldiers in Yemen.]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"Once again, Secretary Pompeo has shown he\'ll go to any lengths to lie
for the Saudi government,\" Malinowski said in a tweet linking to the
original Reuters report.

\"[The Child Soldiers Prevention Act sets up a two step process for
identifying and holding accountable governments that use children as
soldiers. The first step is a simple factual determination: the State
Department must issue a list of countries that do this]{.underline},\"
Malinowski said.

\"[This is all Pompeo had to do: acknowledge the fact that Saudi Arabia
is using at least one child soldier in the war in Yemen. And this fact
is impossible to deny]{.underline},\" he added, pointing to a New York
Times story from December 2018 about how Saudi Arabia uses Sudanese
militias that recruit children to fight in Yemen.

Malinowski then argued that Pompeo could have included Saudi Arabia on
the list but opted not to punish the kingdom with sanctions \-- a
decision he says he would have opposed but would have been more honest.

\"[In step 2 of the process, the State Department decides whether a
country is making a sincere effort to stop using child soldiers, and,
until then, what consequences (like sanctions) should be
applied]{.underline},\" Malinowski tweeted.

\"Pompeo could easily have done the honest thing and listed Saudi Arabia
as having child soldiers, and then decided not to punish it. I would
have disagreed with that decision, but it would have been lawful.
Instead, [he told a blatant, and utterly unnecessary lie: that the
children fighting for Saudi Arabia in Yemen have nothing to do with
Saudi Arabia. [This is a]{.mark}nother [blow to]{.mark} the [credibility
of the State Department]{.mark} at a time [when it desperately needs
it]{.mark}, given the crisis with Iran]{.underline},\" he added.

Such cases, though, can be hard to prove.

Tillerson faced similar criticism

President Donald Trump\'s previous secretary of state, Rex Tillerson,
faced [similar [criticism when]{.mark} he [declined in 2017 to add
Myanmar, Iraq and Afghanistan to the list of countries using child
soldiers,]{.mark} also doing so against the recommendation of
multiple]{.underline} State Department [experts]{.underline}, serving in
various bureaus.

That decision prompted a group of State employees to pen a memo accusing
department leadership of violating US law by refusing to call out these
countries.

The employees wrote, \"Beyond contravening U.S. law, [[this decision
risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department
reports and analysis]{.mark} and has [weakened]{.mark} one of [the U.S.
government\'s primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental]{.mark}
armed [forces and government-supported]{.mark} armed [groups
from]{.mark} recruiting and [using children in combat]{.mark} and
support roles around the world.\"]{.underline}

At the time, then-State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said some
of the allegations involved only \"one or two\" child soldiers, though
she agreed that reporters were fair to ask whether one or two was still
too many.

She commented in a statement that Tillerson had \"made this decision
after considering the credibility of all of the information available to
him from multiple sources.\"

Asked by CNN what message that sends \-- a secretary of state ruling
against his own experts\' credibility \-- Nauert replied, \"I think it
says that people had a different opinion on this particular matter, and
the secretary weighed that opinion and thought about it.\"

#### Reducing arms to child soldier key to fight human trafficking

Lora **Lumpe** **16,** The advocacy director for security sector
governance in the Washington, D.C., office of the Open Society
Foundations, 11/7/16, "In the Fight Against Human Trafficking, Child
Soldiers Get Ignored"
<https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/fight-against-human-trafficking-child-soldiers-get-ignored>

In October, the White House organized a cabinet-level meeting to report
on steps each agency has taken in the past year to monitor and combat
human trafficking. [Secretary of State John Kerry said that [the effort
to end human trafficking was not just a question of morality, but "in
our strategic interest]{.mark}, as well."]{.underline}

Weeks earlier, however, President Obama waived penalties on countries
that recruit and use [[child soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}, saying that
it is in the "national interest" to allow those armed forces to receive
more than \$270 million in U.S. taxpayer-funded assistance. [Pressing
children into combat]{.underline}---some as young as 10 years old---[[is
an **unambiguous** form of human trafficking.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Yet, the reality is that [the U.S. government treats child soldiering
and human trafficking as distinct phenomena. [Child soldiering gets
fewer resources and less attention. It is time to close this
gap.]{.mark}]{.underline} Antitrafficking organizations and [activists
must rally to force the next president to [combat the recruitment and
use of children in warfare as part of a broader effort to eradicate
human trafficking and forced labor.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[For more than a decade, [human trafficking has been a **core concern**
for U.S. foreign and domestic policy. Congress has passed 11 major laws
to address the issue and made those laws **tougher over the
years**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2000, Congress approved the Trafficking
Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which is the centerpiece of U.S.
antitrafficking laws. This law requires the State Department to issue an
annual report ranking countries on how compliant they are with minimum
standards to prevent and combat human trafficking. There are three
tiers, with the worst offenders placed on Tier 3, and subject to
sanctions on all assistance except humanitarian aid.

TVPA also created other mechanisms to protect victims of trafficking and
target traffickers, including the State Department's Office to Monitor
and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP), which produces the report every
year, and the T visa, which grants U.S. residency to trafficking victims
and their families. In addition, it made trafficking a federal crime.

[By contrast[, the Child Soldier Prevention Act (CSPA) of 2008 gives the
U.S. government the authority to penalize governments that recruit and
use child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. This law requires the State
Department to publish an annual list of countries that have recruited or
used child soldiers or have supported armed groups that have done so.
The U.S. government is prohibited from giving police or military
assistance to any governments on that list.

[[But]{.mark} the CSPA includes a major loophole: [The president can
easily **waive** this prohibition]{.mark}, either in full or in part,
when it is deemed to be in the national interest]{.underline}. And every
year since the law came into effect in 2010, President Obama has used
the waiver. According to the Stimson Center, since 2010, more than \$1
billion in assistance and arms sales should have been withheld from
foreign governments as leverage to force reforms.

Earlier this year, the State Department identified ten countries that
recruit and use children as combatants: Burma, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and
Yemen. The prohibition on military aid was exercised in only three
cases---Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The United States had not planned to
provide any military assistance to these countries, so this prohibition
is not particularly meaningful.

For the rest, full or partial waivers were granted, with only a fraction
of prohibited assistance actually withheld. South Sudan, for example,
has made the CSPA list since 2010. The United States withheld \$1.2
million in aid while earmarking another \$99 million for a regime that
openly coerces children into combat roles.

[[This law is the only tool the United States has in place to combat the
recruitment and use of child soldier]{.mark}s, and it is a weak one at
that.]{.underline}

Unlike sex and labor trafficking, there are no special visas for former
child soldiers to come to America, no focus on assistance and
rehabilitation of the victims, no visa bans on officials known to
recruit and use child soldiers.

[Moreover, there is not even a mechanism for linking the CSPA list to
the human trafficking tiers. In 2016, Congo, Iraq, Nigeria, and Rwanda
all were on the CSPA list, but none of them appeared on Tier 3 of the
TIP report---a clear signal that the U.S. treats child soldiers less
seriously than sex and labor trafficking.]{.underline}

[**[The United States should be leading the world in the fight against
all forms of human trafficking]{.mark}**, not effectively ignoring
legislation and looking the other way as some foreign militaries prey on
children. When the next administration begins, [antitrafficking
advocates must hold it to account for its efforts---or lack thereof---to
combat the problem.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Loopholes in human rights laws tank US legitimacy

Emilie M. **Hafner‐Burton** march 20**05**, Emilie M. Hafner-Burton is a
professor at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy and
director of the School's Laboratory on International Law and Regulation.
She is the author of the book \"Making Human Rights a Reality.\", "Human
Rights in a Globalizing World: The Paradox of Empty Promises",
<https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/428442>

First, we extend the concept of decoupling to the institutional
processes and historical contingencies around global human rights
politics. These have created fertile grounds for what we call "radical
decoupling," wherein treaties have an effect opposite to what are
intended. We argue [that [international human rights treaties lack the
mechanisms of enforcement that provide governments with the incentives
not to defect from their policy commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Hathaway 2002; Downs et al. 1996, Tsutsui and Wotipka 2001).
[[This]{.mark} dual nature of the regime---state legitimation without
enforcement---[may at times lead governments to use global laws as a
**shield for increasingly violent domestic
behaviors.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The human rights regime]{.underline} was principally constructed to
identify and classify which rights are globally legitimate, to provide a
forum for the exchange of information regarding violations, and to
convince governments and violators that laws protecting human rights are
appropriate constraints on the nation‐state that should be respected.
Over the years, the [regime has proven increasingly competent in
supplying the instruments necessary to collect and exchange information
on human rights violations]{.underline} and to disseminate that
information on a global scale.9 Despite this informational capacity, the
regime supplies no formal enforcement mechanisms to provide or disrupt
valuable exchange with a target state (Cottier 2002; Goodman and Jinks
in press). [[Treaties offer no material]{.mark}, legal, or political
[rewards in exchange for better practices, and they cannot directly
punish violators by withholding valuable goods.]{.mark} At best, the
legal instruments of the regime directly influence practices by
supplying repressors with information and legitimating motivations to
internalize new norms of appropriate behavior]{.underline}
(Hafner‐Burton in press). As we will show, this form of direct influence
is weak and often ineffective.

This enforcement problem has only been aggravated by the historical fact
that most of the core human rights treaties came into force during the
Cold War, a time when many governments perceived ratification of these
treaties as politically inconsequential under the umbrella of a
superpower that was likely to defend or ignore their domestic policy
choices regarding human rights. Thus, [the international human rights
regime long provided opportunities for governments to gain international
legitimacy by endorsing human rights principles without actually
implementing human rights practices at home]{.underline} (Müllerson
1997). Many governments had claimed their support of human rights ideas,
either in denouncing the Axis powers in World War II or in fighting for
independence from colonizers, and by their own rhetoric, were put in a
position to endorse human rights treaties (Lauren 1998).

[As a growing number of states gained the legitimating benefits of
ratification and yet failed to comply with those commitments[,
this]{.mark} simple [gap between policy and practice led to a more
severe and radical decoupling. Treaty ratification led to the
possibility of **a negative relationship between policy and
practices**]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 Governments, armed with growing
information that commitment to the regime would not lead to serious
enforcement but would grant them legitimacy in the eyes of other states,
were now free to hide domestic human rights practices behind the veil of
international law. Repressive practices could be exacerbated after
ratification, while the treaty regime would be powerless to effect
change.

This possibility of radical decoupling leads us to expect two observable
implications: ratification of international human rights treaties will
either have (1) no direct positive effect on domestic practices or (2) a
negative effect, as repressive governments ratify more agreements and
spiral into a greater degree of violence that the treaty regime is
powerless to stop. This negative effect may be direct---[when
governments purposively use commitment to the treaty regime as a means
to shield their worsening human rights practices from external state
scrutiny---or indirect---when the treaty regime has no capacity to stop
a ratifying state from increasing repression,]{.underline} but the
treaty regime is not itself a cause of the behavior.

Second, we contend that [[this empty promise is often
paradoxical]{.mark}. In spite of the institutional gap between human
rights treaties and governments' incentives to comply, states' rapid and
widespread commitments to the global [human rights regime have led to
the simultaneous elevation of human rights
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that change governments' behavior [[by
way of normative pressures]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a growing number of
states have ratified human rights treaties, the ideas codified in these
treaties have gained nearly taken‐for‐granted status in global politics.
This process has been helped by the activities of nongovernmental
actors, working through international nongovernmental organizations
(INGOs) who diffuse and promote human rights principles worldwide
(Tsutsui and Wotipka 2004). This growing legitimacy of human rights
principles has led to two consequences.

First, INGOs increasingly leverage global human rights norms as a
lobbying tool to pressure national governments to improve their human
rights practices (Ron 1997; Keck and Sikkink 1998; Tsutsui 2004). INGOs,
such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have been
particularly active in publicizing human rights violations to pressure
repressive governments. Domestic groups also reach out to external
actors to publicize violations in their state. For example, Chilean
activists, with the help of Amnesty International and other groups,
sought to publicize forced disappearances committed by their government
(Clark 2001, pp. 73--74), and human rights groups in Indonesia exchanged
information with the International Commission of Jurists and other
international organizations to compaign for the release of political
prisoners (Jetschke 1999, pp. 140--41).

Second, [[the legitimacy of human rights principles makes target
governments vulnerable to]{.mark} potential embarrassment and **[loss of
legitimacy in international society]{.mark}** resulting from
noncompliance with international human rights law]{.underline}. In the
new global political environment characterized by growing awareness of
human rights principles, [[it has become increasingly inappropriate, if
not impossible, **for national governments to dismiss accusations of
human rights violations**]{.underline}]{.mark} as interference in their
domestic affairs. Although it is still difficult for international
bodies to prosecute domestic violations legally, bad publicity generated
by nongovernmental actors often compels governments to address their
domestic human rights problems (Risse et al. 1999; Keck and Sikkink
1998).

#### The UN does not approve of US arming Child Soldiers- The loophole in in 2008 child soldiers prevention act allows the president to waiver countries

**WILPF 17**, women's international league for peace and freedom,
5/11/17, "USA's arms transfers to countries where child soldiers are
used"
<https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CRC-OP-AC/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CRC-OP-AC_NGO_USA_27458_E.pdf>

Experts have long recognized the strong link between child soldiers and
arms transfers, particularly small arms and light weapons. In 2008, the
Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) on Children and
Armed Conflict, stated that ["]{.underline}it [is]{.underline}
[argued]{.underline} by many [that]{.underline} it is
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} proliferation of small arms that has actually
contributed to this rise \[of the phenomenon of child soldiers\] - the
ready [[availability of]{.mark} small [arms]{.mark} in the period 1970
-- 2000 [led to the rise]{.mark} and the phenomeno]{.underline}n [[of
child soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} as we know it today."1 A clear
message from the SRSG continues to be that "[any strategy]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [counter]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[recruitment]{.underline} [of]{.underline} children [must]{.underline}
therefore [contain]{.underline} [initiatives to]{.underline} [better
control arms that fuel conflicts.]{.underline}"2 As Child Soldiers
International has argued, beyond [sit]{.underline}u[ations of active
armed conflicts, children are unlawfully recruited or at risk of such
recruitment in other countries]{.underline} and [invariably]{.underline}
[these practices]{.underline} [put]{.underline} them [at risk of
use]{.underline} in [hostilities,]{.underline} [should]{.underline} an
[armed]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} [erupt]{.underline}.3 Arms
transfers facilitate violence that enables the conditions for
recruitment of child soldiers. [**[Child recruitment is often
accompanied by the use]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or under the threat
[[**of, armed violence.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The Committee on the
Rights of the Child has regularly addressed the connection between child
soldiers and arms trade in its concluding observations.4 For example, in
2013, the Committee urged the USA "to enact and apply full prohibition
of arms exports, including small arms and light weapons as well as any
kind of military assistance to countries where children are known to be,
or may potentially be, recruited or used in armed conflict and/or
hostilities. To this end, [[the State party is encouraged to]{.mark}
review and [amend the 2008 Child Soldiers Prevention Act with a view to
withdrawing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the possibility]{.underline} [of
allowing for presidential waivers to these
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}[."5]{.underline}

In 2016, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)
reported that "with a 33 per cent share of total arms exports, the USA
was the top arms exporter in 2012--16, compared with 30 per cent in
2007--11. Its exports of major weapons increased by 21 per cent compared
with 2007--11. At the regional level, the Middle East was the largest
recipient of USA weapons, accounting for 47 per cent of US arms exports.
"6 In 2013, the Small Arms Survey reported the USA as the world's
biggest exporter of small arms and light weapons.[7 Since 2013, [the USA
has exported arms to countries such as Colombia, Afghanistan, Iraq,
Pakistan and Nigeria]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}8
[[which]{.underline} are a[mong]{.underline}]{.mark} those on the UN
Secretary-General's list showing which state armed forces and non-state
armed groups recruit and use children (known as **["[the list of
shame]{.mark}]{.underline}**"). In this submission, we will provide
[Afghanistan]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Iraq as]{.underline}
[[country]{.underline} [examples]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Between 2013 and 2016, th[e USA has]{.underline} exported arms [worth
of]{.underline} [[\$379 million]{.underline}]{.mark} (Trend Indicator
Values, TIV) [[to Afghanistan]{.mark}9 and]{.underline} worth
[[\$2,225]{.underline} [million]{.underline}]{.mark} (TIV) [[to
Iraq]{.mark}.]{.underline}10 In 2016, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV)
published an analysis covering the period between September 2001 and
September 2015 showing, among other things, that the US Department of
Defense (DoD) "actually spent a possible total of \$2,158,253,826 on
small arms including ammunition and attachments to Iraq and Afghanistan
-- over \$2 billion and almost eight times than publicly stated by the
DoD (\$1,176,671,415 for Iraq; \$981,582,411 for Afghanistan)" during
that period.11 [[AOAV]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[highlighted]{.underline} ["the lack]{.underline} [of **accountability,
transparency and joined up data**]{.underline}]{.mark} that exists at
the very heart of the US government's weapon procurement and
distribution systems."12

In 2016[, the UN Secretary-General reported that [in Afghanistan]{.mark}
the number of verified cases of recruitment and use of children more
than doubled compared with 2014. [The verified recruitment cases were
attributed to the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and the
majority to the Taliban and other armed
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Secretary-General also
reported "continuing concern about allegations of cross-border
recruitment of children and of [use of religious schools in Afghanistan
and Pakistan for child recruitment and military training by the Taliban
and other armed groups]{.underline}".13 Child Soldiers International14
and Human Rights Watch15 are among the NGOs that have reported child
recruitment in Afghanistan.

In late 2016, Human Rights Watch documented 29 cases in which two armed
groups, affiliated with the Partiya Karkerên Kurdistanê (PKK) had
recruited children in Sinjar and in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.16
Previously, Human Rights Watch indicated that militias within the
[**[Popular Mobilization Forces]{.mark}** ([PMF) also use children in
their fight against ISIS.17 The UN Secretary-General has
also]{.mark}]{.underline} [r[eported verified]{.underline} [cases
of]{.underline} [recruitment]{.underline}]{.mark} and use of children in
hostilities, with cases [[attributed to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Kurdish Workers Party and other Kurdish
armed groups, and to groups under the umbrella of the popular
mobilization forces.

### Impact\-\--Liberal Order\-\--2AC

#### Liberal order prevents extinction from nuclear war, warming, and rogue tech development

Yuval Noah **Harari 18**, Professor of History at Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, 9/26/18, "We need a post-liberal order now," The Economist,
<https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now>

For several generations, [the world has been governed by]{.underline}
what today we call "[the global liberal order]{.underline}". Behind
these lofty words is [the idea that all humans share some core
experiences, values and interests, and that no human group is inherently
superior]{.underline} to all others. [Cooperation is therefore more
sensible than conflict]{.underline}. All humans should work together to
protect their common values and advance their common interests. And the
best way to foster such cooperation is to ease the movement of ideas,
goods, money and people across the globe.

Though [the global liberal order]{.underline} has many faults and
problems, it [has proved superior to all alternatives]{.underline}. The
liberal world of the early 21st century is more prosperous, healthy and
peaceful than ever before. For the first time in human history,
starvation kills fewer people than obesity; plagues kill fewer people
than old age; and violence kills fewer people than accidents. When I was
six months old I didn't die in an epidemic, thanks to medicines
discovered by foreign scientists in distant lands. When I was three I
didn't starve to death, thanks to wheat grown by foreign farmers
thousands of kilometers away. And when I was eleven I wasn't obliterated
in a nuclear war, thanks to agreements signed by foreign leaders on the
other side of the planet. If you think we should go back to some
pre-liberal golden age, please name the year in which humankind was in
better shape than in the early 21st century. Was it 1918? 1718? 1218?

[Nevertheless, people all over the world are **now losing faith in the
liberal order**. Nationalist]{.underline} and religious
[views]{.underline} that privilege one human group over all others [are
back in vogue]{.underline}. Governments are increasingly restricting the
flow of ideas, goods, money and people. Walls are popping up everywhere,
both on the ground and in cyberspace. Immigration is out, tariffs are
in.

[[If]{.mark} the [**liberal order is collapsing**, what]{.mark} new kind
of global order [might replace it?]{.mark}]{.underline} So far, [those
who challenge the liberal order]{.underline} do so mainly on a national
level. They have many ideas about how to advance the interests of their
particular country, but they [don't have a viable vision for how the
world as a whole should function]{.underline}. For example, Russian
nationalism can be a reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia,
but Russian nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of
course, nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to
conquer and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist
movements indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's
nationalists, whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain
from advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, [some
nationalists]{.underline} such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They [argue]{.underline} that all
nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

[The world will]{.underline} then [be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, [the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. **All
[attempts]{.mark}** [to divide the world]{.mark} into clear-cut nations
have]{.underline} so far **[[resulted in war and
genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When the heirs of Garibaldi, Mazzini
and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it
proved impossible to find a clear line dividing Italians from Slovenes
or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny
the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[humankind]{.underline} today [faces]{.underline} three [[common
problems]{.mark} that make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that [can **only be solved through global
coop**]{.mark}**eration**. These are **[nuclear war, climate change and
tech]{.mark}nological disruption**. [You cannot build a wall against
nuclear winter or]{.mark} against global [warming]{.mark}, and no nation
can regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or
bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only
the European Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[[An **AI**]{.mark} **arms race** [or]{.mark} a
**[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[**[guarantees]{.mark} the worst outcome**. [Whoever
wins]{.mark}]{.underline} the arms race, **[[the loser will]{.mark}
likely [be humanity itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For in an arms race,
[all [reg]{.mark}ulation[s will collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider,
for example, conducting genetic-engineering experiments on human babies.
Every country will say: "We don't want to conduct such experiments---we
are the good guys. But how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We
cannot afford to remain behind. So we must do it before them."

Similarly, [[consider]{.mark} developing [autonomous-weapon
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, that can decide for themselves whether to
shoot and kill people. Again, [every country will say:
"This]{.underline} is a very dangerous technology, and it [should be
regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we don't trust our rivals to
regulate it, so we must develop it first]{.underline}".

[[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} such
[destructive [arms races is **greater trust**]{.mark} **between
countries**]{.underline}. [[This is **not**]{.mark} **an
[impossible]{.mark} mission**]{.underline}. If today the Germans promise
the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing killer robots in a secret
laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the French are likely to believe
the Germans, despite the terrible history of these two countries. [We
need to build such trust globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point
when Americans and Chinese can trust one another like the French and
Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the 21st
century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective [global
coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only viable
blueprint**]{.mark} for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered by
**[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world
are undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and
the world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel
the impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually **[the whole of humankind will feel the
squeeze]{.underline}**.

### Impact\-\--Authoritarianism\-\--2AC

#### American positioning now will determine the spread of authoritarianism\-\--short time frame to solve

International Policy at American Progress, 10/2/18, "SAVE GLOBAL
DEMOCRACY BY SAVING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY,"
https://crooked.com/articles/save-american-democracy/

[For the **U**nited **S**tates to compete effectively in the global
battle of ideas, [we need]{.mark} to]{.underline} **[[perfect
our]{.mark} own [union and]{.mark} leverage the comparative
strengths]{.underline}** [that Trump now threatens]{.underline}---[rule
of law]{.underline}, [**transparent
[institutions]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and the openness, fairness, and
common humanity of the American people. [[Our next
president]{.mark}'s]{.underline} first take [[must]{.underline}]{.mark}
be [to [strengthen the **democratic compact**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[between the governed and the governing]{.underline}. [That means
mounting an effective response to]{.underline} entrenched economic
inequality, ensuring a free and fair democratic process for all
Americans, addressing the [drivers of declining public trust and
embracing democratic norms]{.underline}.

[**[Time is running out]{.underline}** [for America
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[change]{.mark} its approach]{.underline} at
home as well as abroad. [**[But it must]{.mark} do so**. [How we
position]{.mark} ourselves [now will determine]{.mark} whether the
**U**nited **S**tates can **compete in [this
century]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [As **China**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[invests a trillion dollars for influence overseas [and
**Russia**]{.mark} finds ways to [attack]{.mark} our democracy [and
divide]{.mark} us, America's current drift will effectively serve as as
a form of retreat. [The future of]{.mark} U.S. national security and
[a]{.mark} more [secure world depends on America **embracing**]{.mark}
**its [democratic values]{.mark}**, locking arms [with]{.mark} its
democratic **[allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to stem the]{.mark}
**rising [tide of authoritarianism]{.mark}** and bolstering the
community of democratic nations]{.underline}.

contemplate, and it's a dark world [[in which]{.underline}]{.mark}
Trump, [[Putin, Xi]{.mark}, Erdogan, [and others construct regimes that
are **authoritarian and nationalist**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fascism is
possible in the United States and elsewhere if big business can be
seduced by promises of riches in return for the institutional keys to
democracy. Perhaps Foreign Affairs editors are right to leave
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} dark [[world]{.underline}]{.mark} out, for
it [[would be]{.mark} very dark: [**nationalist wars** with]{.mark}

#### It outweighs extinction

https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf

During the twentieth century, citizens of several nations lived for a
time under extremely [brutal]{.underline} and [[oppressive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}.47 Between them, these states
[[killed]{.mark} more than [one hundred million people, and sought total
control over]{.mark} their [citizens. Previous totalitarian states have
not been]{.mark} particularly [durable]{.mark}]{.underline} chiefly [due
to the problem of ensuring orderly transition between leaders, and to
external competition]{.underline} from other more liberal and successful
states. [[However, there is a]{.mark} non-negligible
[chance]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the world will]{.mark} come to [be
dominated by one]{.mark} or a handful of [totalitarian
state]{.mark}s]{.underline}. If this were to happen, external
competition would no longer threaten the durability of such states to
the same extent.

Moreover, [improvements in]{.underline} certain forms of
[[tech]{.mark}nology [may make it easier for totalitarian states to
maintain control]{.mark},]{.underline} for example [by making
surveillance much easier. [Global totalitarianism could
**exacerbate**]{.mark} **other [existential risks]{.mark}** by
[reducing]{.mark} the [quality of governance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition, [[a]{.mark} long [future under a]{.mark}]{.underline}
particularly [brutal global [totalitarian state

### Soft Power Addon (?)

#### Enforcing the implementation of conditional aid is key to US soft power

Youssef **Elkei 17**, Foreign Service Officer at U.S. Department of
State, et al. April 2017, "Leading a New World Order: Meeting the
Challenges to U.S. Power in the 21st Century,"
<https://isd.georgetown.edu/sites/isd/files/leading_a_new_world_order_>-\_meeting_the_challenges_to_us_power_in_the_21st_century.pdf

Foreign [aid promotes national security by helping to]{.underline}
[defeat the root causes of conflict, including fighting terrorism,
stabilizing weak states, and promoting regional-level security and
global stability.]{.underline} Foreign aid promotes prosperity and
self-reliance by encouraging economic development and private enterprise
in aid-recipient countries, as well as opening and developing
international markets for the United States. America's commitment to
foreign aid reflects not only the nation's moral character, but also its
economic and strategic interests. American taxpayers contributed \$5.9
billion in foreign military financing in 2014, per the government's
Foreign Assistance report.19 Israel (\$3.1 billion) and Egypt (\$1.3
billion) received roughly three-quarters of all foreign military aid
money the United States distributed last year. This amounts to only 4%
of all United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
assistance, with most funds assisting universities, NGOs, and
contractors.

Approximately 76% of the world receives some form of economic assistance
from the United States. Currently, the majority of recipients are in
Africa and the Middle East, but depending on future geopolitical events,
this allocation is subject to change. However, the approximate \$33
billion in requests in aid follow a similar geographic allocation. [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should reevaluate its]{.mark} foreign
[aid allocation practices to ensure]{.mark} that [aid]{.mark} works to
serve U.S. foreign policy objectives and [functions as]{.mark} a source
of [soft power]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The United States should focus on the implementation and enforcement of
conditionality clauses and prioritize programs that target
non-governmental partners and foreign publics.

[Focus on the implementation and enforcement of conditionality
clauses.]{.underline}

Our [[aid agreements with foreign regimes]{.mark} often [include
conditionality clauses that focus on issues such as]{.mark}]{.underline}
democracy promotion[, [human rights]{.mark},]{.underline} open market
economic policies, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} free speech. Congress
[[can withhold]{.mark} aid or revoke assistance [if]{.mark}]{.underline}
it determines that these [[conditions are not
met]{.underline}]{.mark}---however, [[this rarely
occurs]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the United States often has strategic
interests in making security assistance available to authoritarian
regimes with counterterrorism concerns, especially in volatile regions,
[**[Washington must put a higher premium on American values.]{.mark}**
[Without serious enforcement]{.mark} of conditionality, [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [risks losing]{.mark} a powerful
[leverage]{.mark} point, [credibility, and
flexibility]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## Democracy Promotion

### US Key\-\--2AC

#### US democracy key to global backsliding

Larry **Diamond 16**, Ph.D., Senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and
at Stanford University Freeman Spogli Institute, 10-19-2016, \"It Could
Happen Here,\"
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/10/trump-democracy-election-2016/504617/

For at least half a century, [[the bedrock of]{.mark} confidence in
**[democracy's future]{.mark}** [has been]{.mark} its]{.underline}
unquestioned [[**stability** in]{.underline}]{.mark} Europe and [[North
America]{.mark}. [The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and Britain
survived the near-total obliteration of democracy by the fascist powers
in World War II. Then the re-establishment and rapid consolidation of
liberal democracies across Western Europe]{.underline}---and especially
in Germany and Japan---[[laid the foundations for]{.mark} the **[global
expansion]{.mark}** of democracy that followed.]{.underline}

After World War II, there was only one other serious challenge to
America's democratic way of life. That was the dark period in the 1950s
when Senator Joseph McCarthy and his political allies launched a
witch-hunt against alleged and imagined communist sympathizers that
stifled civil liberties and ruined the lives of many innocent people.
The McCarthy era was an ugly one, but the threat was ultimately
confronted and defeated by the forthright actions of courageous
Americans in the media (such as Edward R. Murrow), in politics (such as
Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith), in the law (such as chief counsel
for the Army Joseph Welch), and in the judiciary (led by Supreme Court
Chief Justice Earl Warren). Many of these Americans, like Smith and
Warren, were from McCarthy's own Republican party.

[Since]{.underline} the reactionary fever of [McCarthyism broke in
America, the story of democracy in the United States has been largely
one of progress]{.underline}, particularly the extension of rights to
African Americans, Latinos, lesbians and gays, and other excluded
minorities. [Progress has been uneven and incomplete. **[It has had to
confront setbacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}---Watergate, post-9/11 flashes
of anti-Muslim prejudice, ongoing racism in policing and the justice
system, and the floodtide of dark money in politics, to name a few. But
[the power and example of the United States inspired and supported an
unprecedented expansion of democracy globally from the mid-1970s through
the early 2000s. During this period the proportion of democracies among
the world's states more than doubled, and democracy became the
predominant form of government in the world]{.underline}, with virtually
all the rest of Europe, most of Latin America, half of Asia, and more
than a third of African states becoming democratic. In [the past decade,
and especially in the past two years, freedom and democracy have been
receding with the implosion of the Arab Spring and the reversals of
democracy in countries like Thailand, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Nicaragua.
But [a majority of states]{.mark} in the world [have remained
democratic]{.mark}. And [few have doubted]{.mark} the [stability of
democracy in the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}---until this year.

Over the decades, many [scholars]{.underline} and writers [have wondered
what would happen if a demagogue]{.underline} like Joe McCarthy [ever
captured the nomination of a major political party]{.underline}. The
scar that McCarthy left on American democracy was so deep that his name
is now synonymous with the unscrupulous mobilization of fear and
intolerance for extremist political ends[. McCarthyism is the practice
of making inflammatory, reckless, and unsubstantiated allegations about
the character and patriotism of others in order to achieve political
advantage. But it is not just character assassination. Neither is it
ideological extremism]{.underline}---McCarthy had no coherent ideology.
Most fundamentally, it is what Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab
called, half a century ago in their now once-again vital book The
Politics of Unreason, procedural extremism. [This is the antithesis of
pluralism: **intolerance of difference and dissent**, and unwillingness
to be bound by "the limits of the **normative procedures** which define
the democratic political process." This kind of extremism treats
"cleavage and ambivalence as illegitimate" and seeks to close down "the
market place of ideas." It is what we witness when aspiring strongmen
like]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} in Russia, the late Hugo
[Chavez]{.underline} in Venezuela, Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline} in
Turkey, [or]{.underline}---we should now deeply worry---Rodrigo
[Duterte]{.underline} in the Philippines [win elections and]{.underline}
then [begin to intimidate and suffocate pluralism in the media,
intellectual life, civil society, and even the business community, on
the way toward one-party or one-man rule.]{.underline}

No political impulse could be more contrary to the founding American
spirit than anti-pluralism. At its core, the American democratic
experiment has been about the free contest of ideas, interests, and
groups, along with tolerance for opponents and respect for their
legitimacy. But throughout American history, that core principle has
been challenged under social and political stress by a succession of
extremist movements and politicians---the Know-Nothings, the American
Protective Association, the Ku Klux Klan, Father Charles Coughlin,
George Wallace, the John Birch Society.\* A striking common thread in
these eruptions has been the interplay of ethnic, racial, and religious
bigotry with jingoistic nationalism, nativist fear of foreign
subversion---hence fanatical opposition to immigration---and populist
animus toward educated elites, portrayed through wild conspiracy
theories as plotting to betray "the people." Periodically, these have
given vent to anti-Semitism by putting Jews and alleged Jewish control
of banks at the heart of these imagined diabolical plots.

In his desperate bid to win the presidency, Donald [Trump has
increasingly embraced the rhetoric and logic of the extremist far
right]{.underline} in American history[.]{.underline} The elements were
there for all to see from the beginning of Trump's campaign---the
fanning of fears about illegal immigration, about Mexicans bringing
drugs and crime, about Muslims bringing terrorism; fears of outsiders,
of globalization, of difference. [Trumpism is modern-day
McCarthyism]{.underline}---stoking hysteria about treason and betrayal,
fomenting ever-more outlandish theories of an establishment out to get
the ordinary people that he "alone" can save, and denying the legitimacy
or even decent intentions of opposing politicians. But prior to Trump no
extremist movement or politician ever captured the nomination of a major
political party. And none ever had the masterful command of
communication media that Trump has had of television and the internet.

As a result, we now enter the final three weeks of this distressing
presidential election campaign with Trump relentlessly warning that the
election will be rigged, with his most vociferous surrogate, Rudy
Giuliani, asserting that this will mainly happen in the "inner cities"
(meaning by racial minorities), and with 41 percent of all voters (and
nearly three-quarters of Republicans) agreeing that the election could
be stolen from Trump. All of this is planting the seeds for a
potentially traumatic and unprecedented challenge to the legitimacy of
the election outcome and the new president if Trump does not win. And
that is not to mention his promise to, if elected, prosecute Hillary
Clinton and "lock her up," and his repeated allusions to (gun) violence
as the only way that the people---betrayed by the elites---might have
left to deal with Clinton as president. As the New York Times columnist
Thomas Friedman notedin August, it was this kind of inflammatory
incitement and denial of legitimacy that fed the extremist atmosphere in
which Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995.

[The history of democracy globally is strewn with examples of extremists
and demagogues]{.underline} manipulating prejudice, insecurity, and fear
in a bid for power. [In this sense, [Trump is nothing
new]{.mark}]{.underline}. And from the Poland to the Philippines, the
virus of political extremism and intolerance---of anti-pluralism---is
once again spreading, placing the survival of democracy in jeopardy.
Democracy has failed several times before in the Philippines, most
notably in 1972, when Ferdinand Marcos, nearing the end of his second
elected term as president in the midst of an armed communist insurgency,
declared martial law and became a dictator. It failed once before in
Poland in 1926, when Marshal Jozef Pilsudski staged a coup d'etat
against a fragmented and poorly functioning party system. It was widely
assumed that the rebirth of democracy after the Cold War, and its
maturation in a modern and now economically successful Poland that is
part of the EU, would give it immunity from reversal, but now a
right-wing, anti-pluralist government is gutting constitutional
constraints on its power and stifling opposition in politics as well as
the media. [[Democratic failure could happen]{.mark} again in
Poland---and certainly the Philippines]{.underline}. But could it happen
here?

Among the most dangerous sins of democrats in times of trouble are
arrogance and apathy. The severe polarization of American politics---to
the point where Trump's support base appears to be sticking with him
despite his increasingly anti-democratic statements and the mounting
allegations of his sexual abuse of women---is one sign of the trouble
Americans are in. Fanaticism is another. Recall Trump's statement in
Nevada in February about the intensity of his support: "Sixty-eight
percent would not leave \[me\] under any circumstance. I think that
means murder. I think it means anything." Perhaps most disturbing of all
are the signs that several years before the rise of Trump, support for
democracy had begun to decline significantly, especially among young
people, and not only in the U.S. but in Europe as well.

**[[Democracies fail when people lose faith]{.mark} in them and
elites]{.underline}** abandon their norms for pure political advantage.
In The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes, the late Yale political
scientist Juan Linz stressed two factors in the failure of democracy.
One is the growth of "disloyal opposition"---politicians, parties, and
movements that deny the legitimacy of the democratic system (and its
outcomes), that are willing to use force and fraud to achieve their
aims, and that are willing to curtail the constitutional rights of their
political adversaries, often by depicting them as "instruments of
outside secret and conspiratorial groups." But at least as great a
danger, Linz warned, was "semiloyal behavior" by parties and politicians
willing "to encourage, tolerate, cover up, treat leniently, excuse or
justify the actions of other participants that go beyond the limits of
peaceful, legitimate ... politics in a democracy." It is now not only
fair but necessary to ask whether those in Donald Trump's party who fail
to denounce his democratic disloyalty are not themselves doing great
damage to American democracy.

In 1935, as Hitler was consolidating totalitarian rule in Germany and
the demagogic Senator Huey Long was preparing to run for president in
the U.S., Sinclair Lewis published a novel about a charismatic populist
senator who is elected president by promising to restore the country to
prosperity and greatness and then turns into a dictator. The title of
Lewis's book was It Can't Happen Here. [For more than half a century,
Americans have blithely assumed that democracy is so rooted in their
norms and institutions that nothing like that could happen here. [If
Americans do not renew their commitment]{.mark} to
democracy]{.underline} above all partisan differences, [[it
can]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Laundry List\-\--2AC

#### Democratic network stops war, terrorism, refugee and economic crisis

Kelly **Magsamen 18**, vice president for National Security and
International Policy at American Progress, et al., 9/5/18, "Securing a
Democratic World,"
https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2018/09/05/457451/securing-democratic-world/

A [[democratic]{.mark} values-based foreign [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}
is worth pursuing for three key reasons.

First, it [[will]{.mark} advance long-term U.S. economic and security
interests abroad and [create a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[safer]{.mark}
and more prosperous [world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Compared with
authoritarian regimes, **[[democracies are less likely to go to
war]{.mark} against each other]{.underline}**, less likely to ally
against the United States, less likely [to [sponsor
**terrorism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [less likely to [experience
**famine**]{.mark} or **[produce refugees]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[more likely to **adopt market
economies**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and form economic partnerships with
other democracies]{.underline}.35 Since [liberal democracies tend to
share values rooted in rule of law, fair competition, and transparency,
**they** are natural partners in promoting the stable]{.underline},
prosperous, [[open]{.mark}, and **[peaceful international
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the United States ought to
cultivate through its foreign policy.

It is true that [the process of democratization can be long and uneven
and can sometimes produce destabilizing and aggressive state
behavior]{.underline}. [However, mature and **[established democracies
are more stable, peaceful, and prosperous]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and
more full-fledged democracies mean more economic and security
benefits]{.underline} for the United States.36 Furthermore, [[the global
system of democratic alliances]{.mark}, institutions, and norms the
**U**nited **S**tates helped create and lead after World War II
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[improved material
conditions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and brought peace and **prosperity to
hundreds of millions of people**]{.underline} [across the
world]{.underline}. [Bolstering that democratic system and the
democratic values that underpin it will ensure that future
generations]{.underline} can also [enjoy the fruits of democracy and a
liberal world]{.underline}.

Second, this kind of foreign policy will help secure an American
advantage in great power competition by advancing a compelling
alternative and strengthening the global democratic bulwark. Although
the challenge posed by illiberal regimes today has evolved since the
Cold War, there are still lessons to be drawn from that era. One of the
most significant factors in the collapse of the Soviet Union was the
powerful example and contrast set by flourishing democratic societies in
the United States and Europe. Today, [one of America's greatest
strategic assets is its global network of democratic allies and
partners. [The]{.mark} power of that [democratic
network]{.mark}]{.underline}, even underutilized as it is today,
[[stands in]{.mark} stark [contrast to]{.mark} what today's illiberal
and [authoritarian regimes]{.mark} can offer]{.underline}: namely,
[political order purchased at the cost of **[extreme
corruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[xenophobia]{.underline}**,
[**oligarchy**, and **arbitrary use of**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[state
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To succeed, [any approach to countering
the authoritarian playbook must present a compelling alternative. This
[mean]{.mark}s that [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates,]{.underline} alongside its democratic allies and
partners, [[must **demonstrate**]{.mark} that liberal [democracy
represents the **best path**]{.mark} **to deliver inclusive
prosperity**, rule of law, and a just and equal society to a country's
citizens]{.underline}.

### AT: Democracy Defense 

#### Empirics prove democracy stops conflict 

Ted **Piccone 17**, senior fellow in the Project on International Order
and Strategy and Latin America Initiative in the Foreign Policy program

INTRODUCTION

Seventeen years ago, at a time of rising optimism about international
cooperation and the spread of democracy, 107 countries sent senior
representatives to Warsaw for the first-ever meeting of the Community of
Democracies. The purpose in convening was for democracies to help one
another by sharing knowledge, providing assistance, and engaging civil
society. The premise was that [[democracies]{.mark} in every corner of
the world]{.underline} could [[help]{.mark} each other [meet **common
challenges**]{.mark} in fulfilling their commitment to fundamental
principles of pluralism, rule of law, and universal human
rights.]{.underline}

Since that time, the Community of Democracies has evolved into an
important platform to strengthen bonds among democracies and share best
practices. But the democratic euphoria so evident at the turn of the
21st century has dissipated as both established and emerging democracies
deal with a myriad of social, political, economic, and security
challenges---including terrorism and violent extremism. Because of their
more open and deliberative nature, democracies are perceived as more
exposed to criminal and violent actors bent on exploiting such
vulnerabilities through spectacular attacks against civilians and by
more insidious means of corruption, propaganda, and technology. [The
rise of violent extremism and sectarian conflict in the Middle East
following the Arab Spring has fed into a broader narrative, embraced by
**authoritarian propaganda**, that democracy leads to chaos and the
breakdown of security.]{.underline} This narrative has helped feed
doubts, even in established democracies, about the role of democracy in
underpinning national security and international stability.

Given these trends, the Community of Democracies has a new imperative:
to demonstrate to itself and to the world that the core values of
democracy and human rights are not only goods in and of themselves, but
also the most promising path to peace and security in an increasingly
turbulent world. The report we present here to their representatives and
to all engaged citizens from civil society, parliaments, businesses, and
youth seeks to show that the norms and practices of liberal democracy
and human rights do in fact lead to better security outcomes over time
and across multiple dimensions.

[[Based on]{.underline}]{.mark} a year-long research project gathering
the [[empirical evidence]{.mark} on the relationship between
**democracy** and **security**]{.underline}, and on accumulated
experience with combating the scourge of extremist violence and
terrorism, we can say with confidence that [liberal
[democracy]{.mark},]{.underline} when allowed to consolidate and
flourish, [[is the **best path toward achieving**]{.mark} **domestic and
international [peace]{.mark} and security**.]{.underline} A series of
policy briefs covering a range of security-related issues from civil war
to digital technology were commissioned by the Community of Democracies'
Permanent Secretariat and prepared by the Brookings Institution's
Foreign Policy Program and the Institute for Security Studies.1 This
research, which was complemented by consultations with policymakers,
academic experts, and civil society during workshops held in India,
South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, Sweden, and the United States,
examines these linkages in substantial detail.

[The evidence affirms the standard observation that **democracies do not
go to war against one another**. But the data also prove that
democracies are less]{.underline} **[likely to spawn internal armed
conflicts or experience deadly terrorism]{.underline}** [because they
channel dissent through nonviolent means and manage violence through
respect for the rule of law and human rights. Authoritarian and failed
states]{.underline}, on the other hand, [are more likely to experience
intra and **interstate conflict**, generate **refugees**]{.underline},
[**hinder women's equality**, and **harbor violent
extremists**]{.underline}.

The research also shows that states at intermediate stages of
democratization---hybrid regimes with mixed features of democracy and
autocracy, elite-driven patronage systems, and/or weak
institutions---are generally the most vulnerable to insecurity, whether
from violent crime, terrorism, or entrenched poverty. These are states
where there is both weak institutional capacity and weak political
legitimacy, which together contribute to a breakdown in the social
contract between citizens and the government. This report argues that to
foster domestic and international security, and to address the
underlying drivers of violent extremism, this social contract must be
repaired. [It is essential]{.underline}, therefore, [to adopt strategies
to institutionalize democratic governance, inclusive politics, and human
rights in fragile states]{.underline}. Civil society---as independent
participants, monitors, and critics of our democratic institutions---are
also critical ingredients to any strategy for peace.

The Community of Democracies' participating states and civil society
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[play a key role]{.mark} in [shaping
how democratic governments]{.mark} and citizens [address the]{.mark}
**root [causes ]{.mark}**[of]{.mark} violent [extremism and]{.mark}
pursue strategies of [security]{.mark} and peace in accordance with
democratic values and practices]{.underline}. [It starts and ends with
the bedrock principle that [democratic governments should always strive
to **perfect their**]{.mark} **own [adherence to]{.mark} fundamental
norms of human rights and [democracy]{.mark}**, even in the face of
serious security pressures]{.underline}. In other words, [they should
**practice what they preach**]{.underline}. Throughout this report, we
offer a plethora of other suggestions for international, national, and
subnational actors to tackle the complex and overlapping relationships
between democracy and security. They include: X establishing inclusive
and transparent mechanisms of political, economic, and security
decisionmaking; X investing early and heavily in meritocratic state
institutions for delivering social services; X empowering civil society,
especially women, to play key roles in political, economic, and security
fields of governance; and X protecting an open, secure, and accessible
ecosystem for digital technology.

One fundamental point from the accumulated knowledge and experience with
democracy and security is the need for sustained, long-term leadership
and action, tailored to local circumstances but always tethered to the
fundamental principles of democracy and human rights laid out in the
Community of Democracies' Warsaw Declaration and the core international
human rights treaties. [If the international community stays focused on
the ultimate aim of a world composed of states that respect the
fundamental rights of their citizens and of their neighbors, we will be
that much closer to "saving succeeding generations from the scourge of
war," protecting human rights, and achieving "social progress and better
standards of life in larger freedom,"]{.underline} as envisioned by the
United Nations Charter.

DEMOCRACY AND SECURITY: WHAT THE EVIDENCE TELLS US, AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT
IT

INTERNATIONAL AND INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS

Scholars and practitioners of diplomacy and international relations have
long considered the proposition, articulated by theorists like Immanuel
Kant, that [[societies governed democratically]{.mark} are more inclined
to **[avoid armed conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with each
other]{.underline}. The accumulated evidence, in fact, remains strong
that [established liberal democracies do not go to war against each
other. [Leaders accustomed to]{.mark} the **[negotiated
trade-offs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of shared power and accountable to
citizens]{.underline} through free, fair, and periodic elections,
embedded in constitutional systems with independent judiciaries, free
media, and civilian control of the military, [[have]{.mark} **built-in
[checks against belligerence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [toward similar
liberal democratic countries]{.underline}. [Healthy democracies are
better at credibly signaling their intentions to their citizens and to
other states. Such [transparency reduces]{.mark} the likelihood
of]{.underline} **[[miscalculations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.mark}
is more likely to [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[peaceful
[settlements]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[before]{.mark} the onset
of]{.underline} **[direct [military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At
least in the realm of interstate conflict, [the empirical record
suggests that **a world of stronger democracies will be more
peaceful**]{.underline}.

With the decline of interstate war over the last many decades,
particularly after the end of the Cold War, [the international community
has struggled instead with the persistence of **internal armed
conflicts** of varying intensities, some of which also have
**international dimensions**]{.underline}. Since the fall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989, according to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), the
number of civil wars has increased with a significant uptick since 2010.
Notably, [70 conflicts involving nonstate actors were recorded in
2015]{.underline}, dwarfing the yearly average of 35 between 1989 and
2015. Similarly, [armed conflicts between governments and rebel groups
increased]{.underline} from 41 in 2014 to 50 in 2015---making it the
second highest tally since 52 were recorded in 1991. Factors
contributing to internal conflict, including defining elements of
democracy and human rights such as elections and political repression,
are complex and diverse. [The historical record shows]{.underline},
however, [that [countries with]{.mark} strong records of respect for
[democracy]{.mark} and human rights [are]{.mark} far [less likely
to]{.mark} [experience **civil wars**]{.mark}]{.underline} [than hybrid
regimes]{.underline}.2

Stronger democracies are less prone to civil war for at least two
reasons. First, [at the elite level, healthy [democratic
institutions]{.mark} and regular electoral processes [create
**incentives for political participation**]{.mark} by a wide range of
ideological actors]{.underline} at relatively low cost, [[while taking
up arms involves]{.mark} much **[higher costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Second, [rebel groups are less likely to find support among citizens if
popular grievances are being met through **peaceful**]{.underline} [and
**credible political processes**]{.underline}. Strong autocracies also
tend to avoid civil wars because of the repression and cooptation
employed by their state institutions.

[Hybrid regimes]{.underline}, on the other hand, [face greater risks of
internal armed conflict for at least two reasons]{.underline}. First,
political liberalization opens new avenues for grievances to be heard,
[but elites are not fully committed to implement **meaningful
change**]{.underline}. Countries emerging from civil war are
particularly vulnerable to backsliding during the first five years of
transition as parties test new institutional frameworks, stick to
wartime objectives, or renege on power-sharing arrangements. Second,
[hybrid regimes with weak institutions lack the capacity and resources
to deliver the kind of changes that would **secure civil
peace**]{.underline}. Corruption or capture of state agencies by
predatory elites exacerbate the situation, often locking in economic,
political, and social advantages at the expense of a broader social
contract that benefits all.

#### American democratic engagement empirically reduces conflict 

Ivo H. **Daadler 18**, Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT, President of
the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, interviewed by Brian Hanson,
Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT, Vice President of Studies at the
Buffett Institute, 11/8/18, "Deep Dish: What a World Without US
Leadership Looks Like,"
https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/blog/global-insight/deep-dish-what-world-without-us-leadership-looks

Ivo Daalder: So [US leadership is important because the global order
that was created can only be maintained through American
leadership]{.underline}. Let\'s step back for a minute and remind us
where we came from and why we are here, where we are. Back [in the
middle of [World War II]{.mark} and its immediate [aftermath]{.mark},
the Greatest Generation, that won that war, came together and said,
\"How do we make sure that this doesn\'t happen again?]{.underline} We
had World War I. It wasn\'t a pleasant experience for anybody. And then
we had World War II, which was an even far more nastier experience for
lots of people. How do we prevent that?\" And [part of the diagnosis was
that the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, back in 1918 and 1919, [had
**retreated from the world**]{.underline} [that it had just engaged
in]{.underline}, in 1917 when it entered World War I. And that [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [really needed to]{.mark} be
[engage]{.mark}d in that world in order to **prevent a
repeat**]{.underline}. And that [we needed [to create a **cooperative
system**]{.mark} of economic, political, and security
relations]{.underline} \... [internationally, through the United
Nations; regionally, [through]{.mark} a set of **security
[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [and through a cooperative trading
and open economic system. And that that cooperation would be possible
only if one country was able to lead]{.underline}. So the post-war
international order that was created on the ruins of World War II was a
cooperative system held together, and moved forward, by American
leadership. So [[American leadership has been]{.mark} sort of
[fundamental]{.mark} to America\'s engagement in the world]{.underline}.
And this is in the leadership that Democrats and Republicans, in a
bipartisan way, for 70 years, have held close and near. They\'ve had
lots of differences about how to engage, and where; but not that the
United States, as the \"leader of the free world\" as we like to call
it, should be engaged in the world and do it through leadership.

James Lindsay: A point I want to emphasize here, Brian, that Ivo touched
upon, is that when we talk about the conception of
[leadership]{.underline}, it [was fundamentally about using American
power, America\'s role in the world, [to mobilize]{.mark} our friends
and [allies to meet]{.mark} and]{.underline} **[defeat [common
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Whether we\'re talking [about
security]{.mark} challenges]{.underline}; whether we\'re talking about
[creating [an]{.mark} open [economic system]{.mark}, making
[trade]{.mark} possible; whether we\'re talking about trying
to]{.underline} **[promote [human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[democracy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [in [the **rule of
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [what is remarkable is how successful
that order has been over time]{.underline}, over the last 70 years.
[[We\'ve seen **vast**]{.mark} **growth in [economic
expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[that benefited the **U**nited
**S**tates as well as]{.underline} lots of [other
countries]{.underline}. [We\'ve seen [the **absence of Great Power
War**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And again, [fundamentally this
order]{.underline}, conceived by people like Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
Harry Truman, George C. Marshall; put into practice by people like
Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, [was about preventing the
recurrence of Great Power War]{.underline}. [Indeed part of the
bargaining we made with our closest friends [and
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, think Germany, think Japan, think France
and Great Britain, [is [that]{.mark} they were going to **[put aside
their]{.mark} geopolitical ambitions**]{.underline}, [which had led to
not one but two **catastrophic wars**]{.underline}, [and join us in
this]{.underline} **[common pursuits]{.underline}**, [where they would
**downplay [geopolitical competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[Remarkably successful]{.underline}**. I think it\'s also important
when we talk about [leadership not]{.underline} to [equate]{.underline}
it [with military interventionism]{.underline}. Because certainly if you
look over the past 70 years, the United States has used military force
but not always because the demands of global leadership required it.
That was the case, for example, in Vietnam where many of America\'s
friends and allies cautioned against the course United States chartered;
and obviously more recently, in Iraq.

## AT: China Rise Good

### Transition war

#### A transition to Chinese hegemony causes Sino-US war

Min-hyung **Kim 19**, Department of Political Science and International
Relations at Kyung Hee University in South Korea. 2/4/2019, "A real
driver of US--China trade conflict: The Sino--US competition for global
hegemony and its implications for the
future",<https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/>
doi/10.1108/ITPD-02-2019-003/full/html#abstract

Since the end of the Second World War, the USA has undoubtedly been a
global hegemon. With its preponderant military and economic strength, it
has created a liberal international economic order and maintained it by
promoting global free trade. **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}**A [sudden
[turn to protectionism]{.mark} under the banner of "America First" in
the Trump administration [illustrates]{.mark} "US [fear]{.mark}" [that
its **hegemony**]{.mark} or Pax Americana **[is
declining]{.mark}** vis*-à-vis* China's growing power.]{.underline} It
also demonstrates that [[the US]{.mark}A now [seeks to deter China from
overtaking its hegemony]{.mark} so as to keep US hegemony as long as
possible.]{.underline}

[Currently, [the USA and China are waging a trade
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} What is important to note here is that the
driving force of the trade war between the world's two largest economies
is more political than economic. That is to say, [[as China's]{.mark}
economic and [political influence]{.mark} in the world *vis-à-vis* that
of the USA [increases, US fear]{.mark} about China's power also
[grows]{.mark}.]{.underline} Under these circumstances, [[Washington
makes every effort to **assert** ]{.mark}**its global
[dominance]{.mark}** [by deterring China]{.mark}'s challenge to its
hegemony]{.underline}[\[13\]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ITPD-02-2019-003/full/html#fn013).
It is this sort of "US fear" about hegemonic power transition from
Washington to Beijing that brought about US policies against the BRI,
the AIIB, and Made in China 2015. [The fear of hegemonic power
transition is indeed a driving force for the US-launched trade war.
Understood this way, [the trade war]{.mark} between the USA and China
[may be a harbinger of a much larger]{.mark}-scale [conflict]{.mark}
between the two parties]{.underline}, since as PTT predicts, [**[war is
more likely]{.mark}** to occur [when the power gap]{.mark} between a
declining hegemon and a rising challenger [is]{.mark} getting
[closed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[As China's]{.mark} economic, technological, military and political
[rise continues]{.mark} down the road, [the USA will try to contain
it]{.mark} in order to maintain its global hegemony.]{.underline} The
obvious consequence of this seesaw game is the intensification of the
Sino--US competition over global hegemony. [[The USA and China]{.mark},
the two most powerful states in the world, appear as if they were [on a
collision course.]{.mark}]{.underline} What this means is that [so long
as US fear about China's overtaking US hegemony persists, [a]{.mark}
similar type of [conflict]{.mark} between the two hegemonic powers is
**[likely to occur in the future]{.mark}** even if the current trade war
is over.]{.underline}

#### China rise destroys the LIO and creates chaos and war

Gabriel **Glickman 18**, nonresident associate fellow at the Begin-Sadat
Center for Strategic Studies, Bar-Ilan University. 2-12-2018, Back to
the Future: The Potential of Great-Power Conflict,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/back-the-future-the-potential-great-power-conflict-24464

What does the DOD mean by "order?" In the field of international
relations, the terms "revisionist state" and "status-quo state" are used
to describe, respectively, countries that seek to change the current
international system and those that uphold it. In the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries, the international system has been defined by
[American hegemony and the spread of Western liberal democracy rather
than its challengers---notably, fascism and socialism. This is commonly
referred to as the liberal world order.]{.underline}

Under that world order, the United States is the most powerful country
in the world. It often intervenes in international conflicts at a high
cost, thus keeping dissatisfied nations from overturning the system. The
NDS, however, refers to a recent shift in the current world order with
an observation that, "[[We are facing global disorder, characterized by
decline in the]{.mark} long-standing rules-based [international
order]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The basis for that observation is the argument that the United States
under the Obama administration took a brief, but arguably consequential,
step back from the job of world-order maintenance. As proof of this,
foreign-policy pundits often refer to Obama's favorite quote (which he
got from Martin Luther King Jr., who in turn got it from a
nineteenth-century clergyman named Theodore Parker): "\[T\]he arc of the
moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." The implication of
this quote is that history is ultimately on the side of good rather than
evil (e.g., dictatorships), [and therefore the United States needn't
concern itself with great power competition or world order
strategy.]{.underline} Critics point out that the president's faith in
that sentiment was put to poor use, however, because [it led him to
apologize for American power and to enact a more restrained foreign
policy that in turn allowed revisionist states like Russia, China and
Iran to flourish at the expense of their respective regions'
security.]{.underline} As Charles Krauthammer harshly wrote in the final
months of the administration: "[[The]{.mark} consequent [withdrawal of
American power]{.mark} ... [has yielded]{.mark} nothing but
[geopolitical chaos and immense human suffering]{.mark}.]{.underline}
(See Syria.)."

And that\'s not exactly a partisan argument either. In addition to
conservative critics like Krauthammer, left-leaning foreign policy
scholars, like Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institute, also have been
critical of the results of the Obama administration\'s well-intentioned
foreign policy.

[The NDS promises to reverse the "arc of history" approach to security
policy with a three-tiered approach that prioritizes the "revisionist
powers" of China and Russia]{.underline}, then "rogue regimes" like Iran
and North Korea, and finally "nonstate actors" such as ISIS.

Of course, this new approach may alleviate serious concerns about the
NSS---including my own---that the United States government no longer
cares about global security. But policy will only follow well-written
sentiment if President Trump himself can accept that America is the glue
holding together an entire world order.

With [China now poised to reclaim its previous spot in world history as
a global hegemon, the proverbial clock is turning back. And that appears
to be the reason why the DOD is serious about America being in the
business of world order maintenance]{.underline}. As stated in the NDS:
"Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary
concern in U.S. national security."

Indeed, [China already has a strong economy. It represents almost 15
percent of the global GDP to America's roughly 24 percent]{.underline}.
But, to put that in a slightly different perspective, China has grown
astronomically in the last decade to overtake Japan as the second
largest global economy. Thus, [[there is a real possibility that in the
near future]{.underline}]{.mark} (likely decades) [[it may be able to
surpass even the United States and]{.underline}]{.mark} then harness its
capital to [[develop superior military tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}.
[[At that point, China would]{.underline}]{.mark} be capable of
[[overthrow]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} current
[[international system.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The world has not seen global conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} the likes
of World War I and II [[since the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[became the dominant
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nor, for that matter, has it seen a
recurrence of the great power conflicts of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. As the new defense strategy implies, [[take U.S. hegemony out
of that equation and great powers may clash]{.underline}]{.mark} once
again to the detriment of a cherished world order.

**Empirics prove---shift in the balance of power causes war**

the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, 9/24/15 "The
Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?",
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/

[Based on the current trajectory, [war between the United States and
China]{.mark} in the decades ahead [is]{.mark} not just possible, but
much [more likely than recognized]{.mark} at the moment]{.underline}.
Indeed, judging by the historical record, war is more likely than not.
[Moreover, [current underestimations]{.mark} and misapprehensions of the
hazards inherent [in the U.S.-China relationship contribute]{.mark}
greatly [to]{.mark} those [hazards.]{.mark} A risk associated with
Thucydides's Trap is that business as usual---not just an unexpected,
extraordinary event---can trigger large-scale conflict. [When a rising
power is threatening to displace a ruling power]{.mark}, standard
[crises that would otherwise be contained, like the assassination of an
archduke]{.mark} in 1914, [can]{.mark} [initiate]{.mark} a cascade of
[reactions that]{.mark}, in turn, [produce outcomes none of the parties
would otherwise have chosen.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Can China Rise Peacefully?" [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary
/can-china-rise-peacefully-10204](http://nationalinterest.org/commentary%20/can-china-rise-peacefully-10204)

[[The historical record]{.mark} clearly [demonstrates how
America]{.mark}n policymakers [will react if China attempts to dominate
]{.mark}]{.underline}Asia. Since becoming a great power, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates has [never tolerated]{.mark} peer
[competitors]{.mark}.]{.underline} As it demonstrated throughout the
twentieth century, [[it is determined to remain the world's only]{.mark}
regional [hegemon]{.mark}. Therefore, [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[will
go to great lengths to contain China]{.underline}]{.mark} and do what it
can to render it incapable of ruling the roost in Asia. In essence[,
[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is likely to behave toward China]{.mark} largely [the way it behaved
toward the Soviet Union]{.mark} during the Cold War.]{.underline}

[[China's neighbors are certain to fear its rise as well]{.mark}, and
they, too, will do whatever they can to prevent it from achieving
regional hegemony. Indeed, [there is already substantial evidence that
countries like **India, Japan, and Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
well as smaller powers like Singapore, South Korea, and Vietnam, are
worried about China's ascendancy and [[are looking for ways to contain
it.]{.mark} In the end, [they will join an American-led balancing
coalition to check China's rise]{.mark},]{.underline} much the way
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and eventually China, joined
forces with the United States during the Cold War to contain the Soviet
Union.

#### A Rising china threatens US heg and the liberal order

Joshua **Shifrinson 19**, assistant professor of International Relations
at Pardee School of Global Studies , 2019 "Should the United states Fear
China's Rise?"
<http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/2019/01/Winter-2019_Shifrinson_0.pdf>

Facing a China taking on the trappings of a great power, American
policymakers have reached two interrelated conclusions. First, a growing
consensus concludes that [[a rising China is]{.mark} likely to be [a
threatening China]{.mark} [out to **challenge**]{.mark} both [a]{.mark}
relatively [declining U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and the]{.mark}
ostensible ["**liberal** **order**" backed by]{.mark} [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates since World War II]{.underline}. This has
not always been the conclusion drawn from China's rise, as mentioned
earlier with the "responsible stakeholder" integration strategy. In
fact, even into the 2010s, President Barack Obama emphasized that the
United States welcomed "the rise of a China that is peaceful, stable,
prosperous, and a responsible player in global affairs." 10 [[As China's
rise continues]{.mark}, however, and as [the PRC asserts itself
abroad]{.mark}, the U.S. position is changing]{.underline}. Analysts
across an array of policy and academic perspectives now argue that
[Chinese strategy will become increasingly expansive and bellicose as
the distribution of power shifts in China's favor]{.underline}.11 A
former Obama administration official, for example, warns that "[China is
emerging [with confidence and ambition, setting its sights on **global**
**leadership**]{.mark}, [undergirded by greater **economic**,
**military**, and **ideological** **power**]{.mark}]{.underline}." 12 A
former member of the George W. Bush administration cautions that the
"[intensifying competition between the United States and China is thus
driven not only by the traditional dynamics of power politics---that is,
by the narrowing gap between a preponderant hegemon and a fast-rising
challenger---but also by a wide and deep divergence in
values]{.underline}." 13 Mainstream think tank reports, meanwhile,
allege that China's rise "pose\[s\] challenges" to the United States,
that China is focused on "establishing regional military hegemony in the
Asia-Pacific" in ways inimical to the United States, and that the PRC
holds" ambitions to undermine U.S. primacy."

Not to be outdone, the Trump administration has also embraced this
narrative. As the 2017 National Security Strategy puts it, [[China
is]{.mark} now considered [a "**revisionist**" **power** that "seeks to
**displace** the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in the Indo-Pacific
region]{.mark}," with the 2018 National Defense Strategy elaborating
that China "seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and
[displacement of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to achieve
**global** **preeminence**]{.mark} in the future."]{.underline} 15 For
their part, senior officials have picked up on this thread, arguing---in
Vice President Mike Pence's words---that China "wants nothing less than
to push the United States of America from the Western Pacific and
attempt to prevent us from coming to the aid of our allies." 16 In
short, [a rising [China is]{.mark} assumed to be [a **predatory**,
highly **revisionist** **power** intent on challenging American economic
and security interests and threatening the U.S. position as a great
power itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Building off this dawning consensus,
U.S. policy is now focused on containing China's rise.17 Of course, as
other analysts note, U.S. strategy vis-à-vis China was never devoid of
competitive elements: even while engaging the PRC in the 1990s and early
2000s, for instance, the United States cobbled together a nascent
counterbalancing coalition and redeployed military assets toward East
Asia in a bid to hedge against a hostile PRC.18 At present, however,
engagement is out and hard-balancing is in. The U.S. Department of
Defense itself declared in its most recent National Defense Strategy
that "long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia" constitute
the "principal priorities" for the U.S. military.19 Political leaders
have reinforced this trend, advocating policies designed to actively
confront China.20 Nor is this just rhetoric. The U.S. Navy, for
instance, is moving forces into East Asia---including its newest and
most technologically-advanced assets---in a bid to deter and contain the
PRC. If current plans hold, 60 percent of the fleet will be homeported
in the Pacific by 2020, with upwards of 20 percent of the force
stationed or forward deployed on any given day.21 So-called "freedom of
navigation operations" (FONOPS) by U.S. warships designed to contest
Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea are a regular
occurrence. Furthermore, the effort to organize a counterbalancing
coalition has moved into public view as the United States has looked to
strengthen ties with states such as Vietnam and Thailand and promote
defense cooperation between the United States, Japan, India, South
Korea, Australia, and others[. Put simply, the United States is taking
the lead in trying to suppress China's continued growth, forestall
Chinese revisionism, and by extension, preserve its own position at the
top of the great power ranks.]{.underline}

### No China rise

#### US hegemony is resilient\-\--economic and military superiority prove 

Daniel W. **Drezner 19**, professor of international politics at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. 4/4/2019, "The
uncertain state of American hegemony", \*\*\*edited for ableist language

[[There is a]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~schizophrenia~~ [[problem at the
heart of debates about U.S. hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the one
hand, [the [Trump]{.mark} administration has [made it easy]{.mark} for
critics [to argue]{.mark} that [America has ended]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Long-term trends show that China is catching up to the United States on
just about every conceivable capability metric. Short-term trends show
the European Union is a more potent regulatory power and the United
States has become more isolated on questions of, say, aviation
regulation.

At the same time, [[serious **i**]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations [[scholars]{.mark} have
[argued]{.mark} that [U.S. **hegemonic power**]{.mark} **has
persisted.** ]{.underline}[Stephen Brooks and William
Wohlforth](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01KMBH7S4&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_fhGPCb7QF5RSE&tag=thewaspos09-20) made
the case a few years ago that [the U*nited* S]{.underline}tates
[remained the [preeminent]{.mark} power in the world.]{.underline} My
Tufts University colleague [Michael
Beckley](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07C38TCHJ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_viGPCb1F07ZEW&tag=thewaspos09-20) made
a similar argument last year. [Andrea and Mauro
Gilli](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/isec_a_00337) have
further argued that [[China will be unable to catch up in
tech]{.mark}nological [sophistication to the U.S.
military.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The latest addition to the latter genre comes from [Adam Tooze in the
London Review of
Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n07/adam-tooze/is-this-the-end-of-the-american-century).
Tooze does not dispute the low caliber of current American foreign
policy. Rather, he asks whether it matters in the grand scheme of
things. On the military front, for example, Tooze writes:

[Never before in history has military power been as skewed as it is
today. For better or worse, [it is]{.mark} [America's preponderance that
shapes]{.mark} whatever we call [the international
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} And given how freely that power has been
used, to call it a Pax Americana seems inapposite. [A generation of
American soldiers has grown used to fighting wars on totally
asymmetrical terms. That for them is what the American world order
means.]{.underline}

Tooze makes similar points on the economic side of the power equation:
"[[The hegemony of the dollar]{.mark}-Treasury nexus in global finance
[remains **unchallenged**]{.mark}. The dollar's role in global finance
didn't just survive the crisis of 2008: it was reinforced by it. As the
world's banks gasped for dollar liquidity, [the Federal Reserve
transformed itself into a global lender]{.mark} of last
resort]{.underline}."

Tooze's conclusion is that "[two years into the Trump presidency, [it is
a gross exaggeration to talk of an end to the American world order.
The]{.mark} two [pillars]{.mark} of its global power --- **[military and
financial]{.mark}** --- [are]{.mark} still firmly [in
place]{.mark}.]{.underline} What has ended is any claim on the part of
American democracy to provide a political model."

Is Tooze correct? He does hit upon the central paradox of the current
state of world politics. [[Not even]{.mark} the incompetence of the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [can]{.mark} necessarily [dent U.S.
structural power]{.mark}]{.underline} (though I am more [worried about
the

Tooze).

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has noted repeatedly that
[the [Trump]{.mark} administration has [accomplished]{.mark} [next to
nothing]{.mark} in rewriting the deals that make the world go
round.]{.underline} Its strategy of antagonizing allies at the same time
that it antagonizes adversaries has been self-defeating. America's soft
power has been temporarily eviscerated. Despite all this, however, [U.S.
military and economic capabilities remain pretty formidable. [The

at the center]{.mark} of most of the key networks that drive [world

### Kills Liberal Order

#### China rise destroys the legitimacy of international institutions and the global order

Christopher **Layne 18**, Professor of International Affairs, Texas A&M
University, January 2018 "The US--Chinese power shift and the end of the
Pax Americana," International Affairs,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/images/ia/INTA94_1_6_249_Layne.pdf

[[Not only is the Pax Americana being whittled away
by]{.underline}]{.mark} constraints on Washington's ability to continue
playing its role as the manager of the global economy, and by [[China's
ever-increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
[[dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} of its region; even more strikingly,
[[the institutional framework is being challenged]{.underline}]{.mark}.
An important indicator of the Pax Americana's erosion is the weakening
of its legacy institutions amid calls, magnified by the Great Recession,
[[for a major overhaul of the international institutional
order]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Examples include demands]{.underline} that
[the IMF and World Bank be reformed to give China]{.underline} (and
other key emerging market economies) [greater voting power]{.underline},
[and a]{.underline} (so far unsuccessful) [push to expand the membership
of the UN Security Council]{.underline} by adding, among others, Brazil
and India.

Another indicator of the shifting global balance occurred in November
2008 when [the G8 global economic summit was transformed into the G20 by
the addition of China]{.underline} and other emerging market states
including India, Indonesia and South Africa. The G20's creation as the
new focal point for coordinating international economic policy was a
response to the insistence of China, and the other major emerging market
states, that they be given a greater voice in international economic
affairs. Implicitly, the G20's emergence confirmed three trends. First,
the necessity of [[conceding power to]{.underline}]{.mark} the emerging
market states---especially [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[confirmed
that America's relative power is declining]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second,
the G20's empowerment underscored the shift in power from the
Euro-Atlantic world to Asia. Whereas only one Asian nation (Japan) had
been a G8 member, the G20 has six members from the region: Australia,
China, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. Finally, the G20's
emergence as the central organ of international economic management
demonstrated that---as a result of the Great Recession--- [[the]{.mark}
prestige and [authority of]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and Europe as stewards of the international economy]{.mark} had
[slipped dramatically]{.mark}]{.underline}.49

The past decade or so also has seen [[the creation of new
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that potentially [[could constitute
a]{.underline}]{.mark} parallel---'[[shadow'---international
order]{.underline}]{.mark} outside the framework of the Pax Americana.
The most important of these may be the Beijing backed Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Other examples include the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective Security Treaty
Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia,
India, China, South Africa). [[The staying power and impact of these
institutions are uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}; but at the very least
they are important symbolically. They underscore the decline of the
American-designed post-Second World War international order, and [[the
rise of]{.mark} new powers such as [China]{.mark} and]{.underline}
India---and [the resurgence of old ones such as
Russia]{.underline}---[[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}ing recognition of
their status and prestige, and a concomitant voice in the [[management
of the international system]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT: Climate Impact

#### Chinese climate leadership fails\-\--they aren't curbing their own emissions Edward **Wong 18**, American journalist and a foreign correspondent for The New York Times. 7/19/2018, "China is a Climate Leader but Still Isn't Doing Enough on Emissions, Report Says", <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/asia/china-climate-change-report.html>

[[China]{.mark} has become a global leader in policy and diplomacy on
limiting the effects of climate change, but it [still needs to take
**significant steps** to curb its own carbon dioxide
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to [a report released on
Thursday](http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/guide-chinese-climate-policy).

[The report]{.underline}, written by David Sandalow, a former United
States energy official now at Columbia University, [takes a broad look
at emissions and coal use in 2017 in [China]{.mark}, which [is [by far
the **world's top
emitter**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/world/asia/trump-climate-change-paris-china.html?module=inline)]{.mark} of
the heat-trapping gases that accelerate climate change.]{.underline} The
study also analyses recent policy moves on climate by the country's
government and by the Communist Party.

China has [wide-ranging climate
policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/climate/china-carbon-market-climate-change-emissions.html?module=inline),
enshrined in the national Five-Year Plans and in blueprints at
provincial and local levels. As a result, the report says, it is on its
way to meeting major climate change goals, including lowering a measure
known as carbon intensity, having carbon dioxide emissions reach a peak
no later than 2030 and having a fifth of energy come from
non-fossil-fuel sources by that year.

At the same time, the report says, [[if China's carbon emissions
continue]{.mark} at the current pace, [nations will find it harder
to]{.mark} meet important climate change policy goals --- most notably
[limit]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} average global [temperature increase
to]{.mark} 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or [2 degrees Celsius]{.mark}, above
preindustrial levels.]{.underline}

Even if China's emissions decrease after 2030, that goal could be much
harder to achieve unless they then drop rapidly.

[In 2017, [China emitted 11.7 billion metric tons of heat-trapping
gases, a quarter of the world's total.]{.mark} That included 9.2 billion
metric tons of carbon dioxide, the gas most responsible for accelerated
climate change, [more than the]{.mark} total for the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and]{.underline} [the **E**]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [[combined]{.mark}.]{.underline}

# Arms Sales Adv

## 1AC

### 1AC -- Arms Sales Adv

#### Advantage 2 is [Arms Sales]{.underline}:

#### **Arms transfers increase the use of child soldiers by enabling the conditions for recruitment\-\--any effective strategy to counter recruitment of child soldiers must reduce arms sales\-\--specifically to Iraq and Afghanistan**

**WILPF 17-** Women's International League For Peace & Freedom May 11,
2017 "USA's Arms Transfers to Countries Where Child Soldiers Are Used",
<https://www.wilpf.org/wilpf_statements/usas-arms-transfers-to-countries-where-child-soldiers-are-used/>

[Arms transfers have a well-documented and multi-faceted impact on human
rights]{.underline}. They facilitate the movement of the very same
weapons -- or ammunition -- that are used to curtail human rights in
direct and specific ways by militaries, paramilitaries, law enforcement
groups, criminals and gangs. This impact includes, but is not limited to
the recruitment of children and their use in hostilities.

[Experts]{.underline} have long [recognized the **[strong link between
child soldiers and arms transfers]{.mark},** particularly small arms and
light weapons]{.underline}. In 2008, the Special Representative of the
Secretary General (SRSG) on Children and Armed Conflict, stated that "it
is argued by many that it is **[the [prolif]{.mark}eration [of small
arms]{.mark} that has actually [contributed to this rise]{.mark}
\[[of]{.mark} the phenomenon of [child soldiers]{.mark}\]]{.underline}**
-- the ready availability of small arms in the period 1970 -- 2000 led
to the rise and the phenomenon of child soldiers as we know it
today."\[1\] A clear message from the SRSG continues to be that ["**[any
strategy to counter]{.mark} the [recruitment of children must]{.mark}
therefore contain initiatives to [better control arms]{.mark} that fuel
conflicts."\[**]{.underline}2\] As Child Soldiers International has
argued, beyond situations of active armed conflicts, [children are
unlawfully recruited or at risk of such recruitment in other countries
and invariably these practices put them at risk of use in hostilities,
should an armed conflict erupt]{.underline}.\[3\] **[Arms transfers
facilitate violence that enables the conditions for recruitment of child
soldiers.]{.underline}** Child recruitment is often accompanied by the
use, or under the threat of, armed violence. The Committee on the Rights
of the Child has regularly addressed the connection between child
soldiers and arms trade in its concluding observations.\[4\] For
example, in 2013, the [Committee urged the USA]{.underline} "**[to
[enact]{.mark} and apply full [prohibition of arms
exports]{.mark},]{.underline}** [including small arms and light weapons
as well as any kind of military assistance [to countries where children
are]{.mark} known to be, or may potentially be, recruited or [used
in]{.mark} armed [conflict]{.mark} and/or hostilities.]{.underline} To
this end, the State party is encouraged to review [and]{.underline}
amend the 2008 Child Soldiers Prevention Act with a **[view to
[withdrawing the]{.mark} possibility of allowing for [presidential
waivers to these countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"\[5\]

In 2016, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute [(SIPRI)
reported that]{.underline} "with a 33 per cent share of total arms
exports, the [USA was the top arms exporter]{.underline} in 2012--16,
compared with 30 per cent in 2007--11. [Its exports of major weapons
increased by 21 per cent compared with 2007--11.]{.underline} At the
regional level, the Middle East was the largest recipient of USA
weapons, accounting for 47 per cent of US arms exports. "\[6\] In 2013,
the Small Arms Survey reported the USA as the world's biggest exporter
of small arms and light weapons.\[7\] [Since 2013, the USA has exported
arms to]{.underline} countries such as [Colombia, [Afghanistan,
Iraq]{.mark}, Pakistan and Nigeria]{.underline},\[8\] [which are [among
those on the]{.mark} UN Secretary-General's [list showing which state
armed forces and non-state armed groups recruit and use
children]{.mark}]{.underline} (known as "the list of shame"). In this
submission, we will provide Afghanistan and Iraq as country examples.

[Between 2013 and 2016, the USA has exported arms worth of]{.underline}
\$379 million (Trend Indicator Values, TIV) to Afghanistan\[9\] and
worth [\$2,225 million (TIV) to Iraq.]{.underline}\[10\] In 2016, Action
on Armed Violence (AOAV) published an analysis covering the period
between September 2001 and September 2015 showing, among other things,
that [the US Department of Defense ([DoD]{.mark}]{.underline}) "actually
[[spent]{.mark}]{.underline} a possible total of \$2,158,253,826 [[on
small arms]{.mark} including ammunition and attachments [to Iraq and
Afghanistan -- over \$2 billion]{.mark} and almost eight times than
publicly stated]{.underline} by the DoD [(\$1,176,671,415 for
Iraq]{.underline}; \$981,582,411 for Afghanistan)" during that
period.\[11\] AOAV further highlighted "the lack of accountability,
transparency and joined up data that exists at the very heart of the US
government's weapon procurement and distribution systems."\[12\]

In 2016, the UN Secretary-General reported that in Afghanistan the
number of verified cases of recruitment and use of children more than
doubled compared with 2014. The verified recruitment cases were
attributed to the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and the
majority to the Taliban and other armed groups. The Secretary-General
also reported "continuing concern about allegations of cross-border
recruitment of children and of use of religious schools in Afghanistan
and Pakistan for child recruitment and military training by the Taliban
and other armed groups".\[13\] Child Soldiers International\[14\] and
Human Rights Watch\[15\] are among the NGOs that have reported child
recruitment in Afghanistan.

In late 2016, Human Rights Watch documented 29 cases in which two armed
groups, affiliated with the Partiya Karkerên Kurdistanê [([PKK) had
recruited children]{.mark} in Sinjar and in the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq]{.underline}.\[16\] Previously, Human Rights Watch indicated that
[[militias within]{.mark} the Popular Mobilization Forces [(PMF)]{.mark}
also [use children in their fight against
ISIS.\[]{.mark}]{.underline}17\] [The UN Secretary-General has also
reported verified cases of recruitment and use of children in
hostilities]{.underline}, with cases attributed to ISIS, the Kurdish
Workers Party and other Kurdish armed groups, and to groups under the
umbrella of the popular mobilization forces.\[18\]

As noted earlier, [**[arms transfers facilitate violence that enables
the conditions for recruitment of child soldiers]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
The fact that recruitment and use of children in hostilities is a
recognized problem in a country should be a cause for concern in making
arms export decisions, per any human rights assessment. Such assessment
should not be limited to determining whether arms transfers from the USA
are a direct factor in making it easier to recruit children or whether
are used by child soldiers.

The Committee should reiterate its recommendations to [the
USA]{.underline} with regard to arms transfers, in particular the
recommendation to [enact and apply full prohibition of arms exports,
including small arms and light weapons,]{.underline} as well as any kind
of military assistance to countries where children are known to be, or
may potentially be, recruited or used in armed conflict and/or
hostilities.

#### Scenario \[x\]: Iraq

#### The use of child soldiers in Iraq by Popular Mobilization Forces increases sectarian conflict and instability\-\--the US needs to pressure Baghdad to increase accountability

Belkis **Willie 17**- senior Iraq researcher in the Middle East and
North Africa division at HRW; investigates human rights abuses in Iraq.
1/6/2017 "Integrating Iraqi Fighting Forces Is Not Enough", Human Rights
Watch,
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/06/integrating-iraqi-fighting-forces-not-enough>

Human Rights Watch saw [Shia armed forces allied with the Iraqi
government commit horrific abuses against the Sunni civilian
population]{.underline} during the operation to retake Fallujah back in
May. We didn't want it to happen again in Mosul.

As a result, Human Rights Watch pressed the Iraqi government to keep
[the abusive units within the Popular Mobilization Forces,]{.underline}
also known as Hashd al-Sha'abi, out of the Mosul operation. Diplomats I
spoke with at the time said that letting these militia participate could
be the biggest risk to the Sunni Arab civilians of Mosul as they fled
the fighting against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS).

In an attempt to curb the abuses while still relying on the fighting
forces, [[the Iraqi government]{.mark}, with strong U.S. support, took
steps to [bring]{.mark} the [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization
[F]{.mark}orces [under]{.mark} Iraqi [central command]{.mark}. They also
started integrating Sunni units into the Popular Mobilization
Forces.]{.underline}

[The [authorities miscalculated]{.mark}, however]{.underline}. It turned
out that [[integrating]{.mark} Sunni units into the Popular Mobilization
Forces, so that fighters would represent the same sectarian background
as the civilians inside Mosul, [was not]{.mark} in and of itself [a
safeguard against abuse]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[We]{.mark} have [documented]{.mark} several incidents of
[abuse]{.mark} by Sunni [forces within the P]{.mark}opular
[M]{.mark}obilization [F]{.mark}orces]{.underline} since the fight
against ISIS in Mosul began[, **[including]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[unlawful detention, ill-treatment and torture of civilians,
executions, and [the use of child soldiers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In late October, the Hashad al-Asha'ri Fares al-Sabawy militia detained
and beat at least 22 men from two villages near Mosul. We have found
that [[the unit]{.mark},]{.underline} and another called the Hashad
al-Asha'ri Farsan al-Jubour, **[[had been recruiting child soldiers from
a camp for]{.mark} internally [displaced people]{.mark} since the
spring]{.underline}**. In late November, [Farsan al-Jubour, a militia
made up of Sunni fighters, also summarily executed at least four men
they suspected of affiliation with ISIS, without any judicial
proceeding.]{.underline}

[We even documented]{.underline} one incident of [a Shabak unit within
the Popular Mobilization Forces unlawfully detaining at least 150
families overnight.]{.underline}

We know that **[[the U.S.]{.mark} government [is training some
of]{.mark} the Shia and Sunni [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization
[F]{.mark}orces,]{.underline}** though we don't know if the groups we
found to have committed these abuses benefited from this training.

The lesson from the last months of fighting in Iraq is clear: **[[Simply
including Sunni fighters in militias is no guarantee that they will
suddenly perform like well-trained military]{.underline}]{.mark}** units
with clear command and control structures, accountability processes for
abuses, [**[with the interests of the Iraqi people at
heart.]{.underline}** [Absent accountability]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
abuses committed by these armed forces, [we can expect these abuses to
continue]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Similarly, [just integrating groups into the official Iraqi state forces
is not a cure-all for abusive groups]{.underline}.

In February, [Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi issued Order 91, officially
[incorporating the]{.mark} [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization Forces
[as an "independent military formation]{.mark}" within Iraq's security
forces]{.underline}. On November 26, Iraq's parliament passed a law
formalizing the decision. Military analysts in Washington and Baghdad
are split on whether this integration will prove beneficial to Iraq.
They first believed that this step represents an important way for Abadi
to bring some order to Iraq's security structures by establishing limits
to their powers. [Others think that this [will **increase
sectarianism**]{.mark} in the armed forces, [or]{.mark} worse still,
will [allow the P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization [F]{.mark}orces to
**[carry out abuses in the name of the Iraqi
government]{.mark}**]{.underline} with increased power and impunity.

If the past is any guide, however, what is clear is that if [Abadi's
[government is unwilling to investigate allegations of abuse]{.mark} by
Popular Mobilization Forces or other forces including the Iraqi Security
Forces and hold the abusers responsible]{.underline}, any plans of
bringing Shia, Sunni and other minority forces in line may fail
miserably. So far we have not seen the results of a single government
investigation.

Meanwhile, senior U.S. military commanders --- like Brig. Gen. Rick
Uribe and Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend --- say they are so far impressed
with the behavior of the Iraqi forces.

But [if [the U.S. government]{.mark}]{.underline} wants to continue to
support the Iraqi military and to train these groups, it
[[should]{.underline} [be **leaning hard on Baghdad** to
investigate]{.underline}]{.mark} the growing list of [[abuse]{.mark}
allegations and to bring to justice those it finds
responsible]{.underline} for any wrongdoing.

#### Iraq instability spills over to Middle East war

Baha **Erbas 15**, fellow at the Turkish Heritage Organization, \"THE
UNITY OF IRAQ: A NEXUS OF STABILITY\",
https://www.turkheritage.org/en/publications/analysis/the-unity-of-iraq-a-nexus-of-stability-4808

[[Iraq]{.mark} is the Middle East in miniature. **It [holds all]{.mark}
the [religious and ethnic diversity of the]{.mark} entire
[region]{.mark}** from the Mediterranean to the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}; from Anatolia to the Indian Ocean. [To look at
[the]{.mark} grand [Middle East]{.mark} picture realistically, the
social scientist or diplomat [must recognize Iraq as **the
region's**]{.mark} **essence and [heart]{.mark}**; the social fabric and
the harmoniousness of the Middle East is alive in all parties in Iraq.
Sunnis, Shias, Yezidis, Arabs, Persians, Kurds, Turks---with thousands
of years of history. **[Being the cradle of]{.mark} all these [ancient
civilizations makes Iraq the one indispensable]{.mark} social and
political [actor]{.mark} throughout the region. Iraq is [the bedrock of
the Middle East]{.mark}, for providing stability in the region. [The
stability of the entire region has a deep]{.mark} balance and
[connection with the future of Iraq]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[The Shia of Iraq have a profound effect, acting as a buffer between
Iran and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States and the Sunnis. The Kurds
being the buffer zone between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria; Sunnis being
the heart of the traditional monarchies and the state until Saddam's
fall, and occupying a special place between Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey
and Iran. All these groups have a potential stake and risk in any social
or political developments in all these countries. Conversely, the
instability in Iraq deeply affects the stability of all these countries.
Therefore, **[the crux of the stability in the region depends on the
future of Iraq]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Due to this socially vital composition of Iraq, any political decision
made without taking into consideration the balance and equilibrium of
all these macro-regional factors would bring the entire region into
greater instability and calamity.]{.underline}

Throughout history, [no great power was able to dominate the region
without having a strong hand in Iraq.]{.underline} The Ottoman Empire,
due to Iraq's unique geopolitical and social position, had wielded a
strong hand in the days when it controlled Bagdad.

The invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the vacuum that created, has had
direct consequences for the entire region through ISIS, DAESH, PYD, and
YPG. The situation in Syria isn't readily understood without looking at
Iraq's last decade of instability. Today, the Syrian Civil War
represents the most bitter story of the post-Cold War era. A third of
the country's population has fled the country, almost a million people
are lost or dead, and no one knows that when the calamity will end. As
we have observed, [[Iraq]{.mark} always [has]{.mark} had [a massive
potential to destabilize **Turkey, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf region**, and]{.mark} also could affect [**the US**, which has a
strong interest in the region for its global posture. **Any development
in Iraq could easily lead the entire region into a calamity with its
domino-effect**]{.mark}. Due to these crucial points, the
US]{.underline}, Turkey, the EU and all Iraq's neighbors [strongly
support the unity and the territorial integrity of Iraq, and all actors
see that the future of Iraq has come to be the future of the Middle
East.]{.underline}

Today, the scholars, pundits, diplomats, and politicians are all
concerned about the future of Iraq and the possible outcomes for the
region. [All these [concerns come down to]{.mark} a single point:
[whether Iraq will keep its **territorial integrity**]{.mark} or not.
**[A united Iraq]{.mark}** keeping its territorial integrity [is
**crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline} for Turkey and Turkey's relations with
the US and all other regional actors. [Therefore, all [groups within
Iraq politics should look for a **better atmosphere**]{.mark} in which
[to]{.mark} collaborate, [cooperate]{.mark} for the prosperous future of
Iraq, [and **avoid**]{.mark} any [**confrontation** that would lead
to]{.mark} any break-up and another **[humanitarian
calamity]{.mark}**]{.underline} as we are seeing today in Syria.

#### Middle east war goes nuclear

Nader **Entessar** 7/2/**19**, professor and chair of the department of
political science and criminal justice at the University of South
Alabama, Kaveh L. Afrasiabi, professor of political science, taught poli
sci at the University of Tehran, Boston University, and Bentley
University, \"A nuclear war in the Persian Gulf?\", Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2019/07/a-nuclear-war-in-the-persian-gulf/

[Tensions between the United States and Iran are spiraling toward [a
military confrontation]{.mark} that [carries **a real
possibility**]{.mark} **that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will
use nuclear weapons]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Iran's assortment of
asymmetrical capabilities---all constructed to be effective against the
United States---nearly assures such a confrontation. [[The]{.mark}
current [US nuclear posture leaves]{.mark} the Trump administration at
least [open]{.mark} to [the use of **tactical nuclear weapons** in
conventional theaters. Some]{.mark} in the current administration
[may]{.mark} well [think it to be in the best interest]{.mark} of the
United States [to seek a quick]{.mark} and decisive victory [in
the]{.mark} oil hub of the [Persian Gulf]{.mark}---and to do so by using
its nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}

We believe there is a heightened possibility of a US-Iran war triggering
a US nuclear strike for the following reasons:

The sanction regime set against the Iranian economy is so brutal that it
is likely to force Iran to take an action that will require a US
military response. Unless the United States backs down from its present
self-declared "economic warfare" against Iran, this will likely escalate
to an open warfare between the two countries.

In response to a White House request to draw up an Iran war plan, the
Pentagon proposed sending 120,000 soldiers to the Persian Gulf. This
force would augment the several thousands of troops already stationed in
Iran's vicinity. President Trump has also hinted that if need be, he
will be sending "a lot more" troops. [Defeating Iran through
[conventional]{.mark} military [means would]{.mark} likely
[require]{.mark} a half million US forces and US preparedness for [many
casualties]{.mark}. The US nuclear posture review is worded in such a
way that the use of tactical nuclear weapons in conventional theaters is
envisaged, foreshadowing the concern that in a showdown with a menacing
foe like Iran, the nuclear option is on the table. [The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} once again [justify]{.mark} using nuclear
force for the sake of a decisive victory and casualty-prevention, **[the
logic used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Trump's **cavalier attitude** toward nuclear weapons, **trigger-happy
penchant**, and]{.mark} utter [**disdain for Iran**, show]{.mark} that
[he would]{.mark} likely [have **no moral qualm**]{.mark} about issuing
an order to launch a limited nuclear strike]{.underline}, especially in
a US-Iran showdown, one in which the oil transit from the Gulf would be
imperiled, impacting the global economy and necessitating a speedy end
to such a war.

If the United States were to commit a limited nuclear strike against
Iran, it would minimize risks to its forces in the region, defang the
Iranian military, divest the latter of preeminence in the Strait of
Hormuz, and thus reassert US power in the oil hub of the Persian Gulf.
Oil flowing through the Strait of Hormuz is critical to a rising China.
US control over this merchant waterway would grant the United States
significant leverage in negotiations. A limited US nuclear strike could
cause a 'regime change' among Iranian leadership, representing a
strategic setback for Russia, in light of their recent foray in the
Middle East with Iranian backing.

Undoubtedly, [there are several significant negative consequences to a
US use of nuclear weapons, **[opening the way for other nuclear-armed
states to emulate US behavior, and]{.mark} for many other [non-nuclear
weapons states to seek their own]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent]{.mark}
shields**.]{.underline} There would also be a huge outcry in the
international community causing the US global image to suffer.

Will such anticipated consequences represent sufficient obstacles to
prevent a limited U.S. nuclear strike on Iran? With President Trump, who
counts on "bomb Iran" billionaire Sheldon Adelson as one of his main
campaign contributors, **[[the threshold for using nukes]{.mark}
certainly [seems]{.mark} to have been [lowered]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

<https://www.newsweek.com/how-isis-got-weapons-us-used-them-take-iraq-syria-748468>

The Islamic State militant group [[(ISIS) got its hands on]{.mark} vast
supplies of [weapons by **taking advantage** of U.S.]{.mark} weapons
[transfers that]{.mark} may have [violated international
agreements]{.mark} between Washington and its allies, according to a new
report.]{.underline}

As much as 90 percent of ISIS\'s arms and ammunition were found to have
originated in Russia, China and Eastern European states. [The [jihadis
were able to obtain]{.mark} much of [this arsenal as a result of]{.mark}
former President Barack Obama\'s [support for rebels in
Syria]{.mark},]{.underline} U.K.-based Conflict Armament Research
reported after analyzing 40,000 items recovered by its investigators
along ISIS front lines between July 2014 and November 2017. By
purchasing \"large numbers\" of European arms and ammunition and then
diverting them to nonstate actors in Syria without notifying the
sellers, the U.S. reportedly \"violated the terms of sale and export
agreed between weapon exporters\...and recipients.\"

\"[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and Saudi Arabia
[supplied]{.mark} most of [this materiel]{.mark} without authorization,
apparently [to Syria]{.mark}n opposition forces. This [**diverted
materiel**, recovered from]{.mark}]{.underline} IS forces, comprises
exclusively Warsaw Pact--caliber weapons and ammunition, purchased by
the United States and Saudi Arabia from European Union (EU) member
states in Eastern Europe,\" [the report
found](http://www.conflictarm.com/download-file/?report_id=2568&file_id=2574),
using an alternative acronym [for [ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"[[Supplies]{.mark} of materiel into the Syrian conflict [from]{.mark}
foreign parties---notably [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and Saudi
Arabia---[have indirectly **allowed IS to obtain**]{.mark} **substantial
[quantities]{.mark}** [of anti-armor ammunition]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
it later added.

ISIS emerged out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and other jihadi groups in the wake
of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and overthrow of its leader, President
Saddam Hussein. After announcing its establishment in 2013, ISIS spread
into Syria to take advantage of the ongoing war between the Syrian
military and the rebel and jihadi groups trying to overthrow it since
2011. In Syria\'s conflict, [the U.S. had been supplying arms to
insurgents opposed to Syrian President]{.underline} Bashar al-Assad
since at least 2012 and, when ISIS began rapidly seizing territory in
2013 and 2014, many U.S.-armed rebel groups were either defeated by the
incoming militants or joined them. [[ISIS]{.mark} reportedly
[received]{.mark} most of its [initial supplies by
**overtaking**]{.mark} Russia-backed Syrian and [U.S.-backed Iraqi
military]{.mark} positions, but later vastly received a massive boost
from the U.S.\'s effort to overthrow Assad.]{.underline}

As ISIS began to take nearly half the country[, the U.S. continued to
train and equip Syrian rebels,]{.underline} using local allies like
Jordan and Turkey as intermediaries. In its report, Conflict Armaments
Group included dozens of photographs of [EU-manufactured [weapons
believed to have been procured by the U.S]{.mark}. and Saudi Arabia,
[shipped to Syrian rebels]{.mark} and [later **obtained by
ISIS**]{.mark},]{.underline} which moved them between Iraq and Syria.
These included a powerful anti-tank missile launcher bought from a
Bulgarian manufacturer by the U.S. Army and wielded by ISIS only weeks
later.

Over the years, growing jihadi influence and territorial losses among
Syrian rebels compelled the U.S. [to cut CIA
support](https://www.newsweek.com/us-cut-support-moderate-syria-rebels-improve-russia-ties-moscow-639762) for
such groups and left allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia to carry the
embattled, fractured opposition. The U.S. ultimately opted to focus
instead on the Pentagon-led effort to back the Syrian Democratic Forces,
a mostly Kurdish coalition of Arabs and ethnic minorities solely
battling ISIS, not Assad.

A year after a U.S.-led coalition began bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria
in 2014, Russia joined the fray by staging a direct military
intervention on behalf of Assad, allowing the Syrian military and its
allies, including Iran-backed militias, to [retake most of the country
previously lost to jihadis and
rebels](https://www.newsweek.com/us-lost-war-syria-iran-russia-winning-final-battle-674833).
The two anti-ISIS campaigns have rushed to what\'s left of ISIS in the
east, with the coalition of Syria, Russia and Iran claiming victory last
month.

#### ISIS is still strong\-\--acquisition of weapons spurs attacks

**Carafano 19**, James Jay Carafano, Vice President of The Heritage
Foundation, Leading Expert on National Security and Foreign Policy,
3/25/19, "The ISIS Caliphate Is Gone -- But ISIS Will Be Back",
<https://www.heritage.org/terrorism/commentary/the-isis-caliphate-gone-isis-will-be-back>

This is a milestone victory for the forces of counterterrorism. But it
is not the end of the [war on
terrorism.](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism) Unfortunately,
[the bad guys will be back on the field soon enough.]{.underline}

It was also disturbingly effective. [**[Tens of thousands]{.mark}**
foreign fighters answered the call, flocking to [join the ranks of
ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, ISIS launched a global media
campaign that promoted radicalization and inspired terrorist attacks
around the world, from North Africa to Europe to the U.S. and Australia.

Taking down the caliphate was crucial. For one[, [ISIS created a
**humanitarian nightmare**]{.mark}. [The group]{.mark}'s so-called
"holy" warriors [stole, raped, enslaved and murdered]{.mark} with
abandon,]{.underline} filling mass graves on a regular basis.

As the group grew, [[it posed a **grave danger to regional
stability**]{.mark} and a terrorist threat worldwide]{.underline}. It
also represented a direct challenge to the West: Could democratic
nations beat back and defeat an armed Islamist force, or were they
nothing more than a "paper tiger," as Usama bin Laden had claimed?

But the terrorists won't go quietly into the night. [When bin Laden was
chased out Africa, he fled to Afghanistan. It was there that he planned
the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United
States.]{.underline}

[And [when Al Qaeda was crushed]{.mark} in Iraq, the [terrorists looked
for another opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. That turned into the ISIS
uprising in Iraq and Syria.

[[Now that the ISIS caliphate has been ground]{.mark} to dust, the
**[remnants will]{.mark} once again [look for a way to regain]{.mark}
their [honor]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To them, that means [[showing they
have]{.mark} the [capacity to slaughter]{.mark} and enslave
[innocents]{.mark}]{.underline} of all creeds, faiths and colors.

Like the fire brigade that just put out the forest fire, the U.S. and
its friends and allies will have to be on watch. [The [sparks will flare
up]{.mark} and try to rage again]{.underline}. The only question is:
[Where will the terrorists go next?]{.underline}

The scattered remnants of ISIS, Al Qaeda and their ilk roam about the
Greater Middle East and beyond. [And [**there is no shortage of places**
where they can]{.mark} find refuge and recuperate, [regroup and **rise
again**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[There's also [no shortage of opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} for
mischief.

The state of Syria remains far from settled. [The [chaos]{.mark} there
[is a welcoming environment for terrorism]{.mark}.]{.underline} And
while remarkable progress has been made in Iraq, sectarian strife
remains ever present.

On top of this, we can't forget [about [Iran]{.mark}, the world's
biggest state sponsor of terrorism. Tehran [**has made accommodations
for Al Qaeda** before]{.mark}]{.underline}. The mullahs might well help
out Sunni extremists again, if it helps make trouble for others.

[[**We can't make the mistake** of dropping Islamist terrorism from
the]{.mark} national and international Bad Guys
[List]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now that ISIS is down, we must to keep it
down. And out.

#### Scenario \[x\]: Peshmerga

#### US continues to arm Peshmerga troops\-\-- supporting Kurds makes conflict more sectarian and angers Turkey

The alliance of Kurdish fighters has also converged in Iraq, where the
Islamic State had advanced toward the autonomous Kurdish region in the
northern part of the country. [[The
Peshmerga]{.underline}]{.mark}---[armed fighters who protect Iraqi
Kurdistan---have **[joined with Iraqi security]{.mark} [forces and
received arms]{.mark} [and financial assistance]{.mark} [from the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.**]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} the [Kurd]{.mark}s]{.underline} do [[succeed in
establishing]{.mark} an [independent state]{.mark} in Syria amid the
chaos gripping the region, [it could accelerate secessionist]{.mark}
movements]{.underline} in other Kurdish areas of the Middle East.
[[Heightened terrorist activity]{.underline}]{.mark} by Kurdish

U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates--- and its allies---[which designated the
PKK a]{.mark} foreign [terrorist organization]{.mark}]{.underline} in
1997.

[[U.S.-Turkey relations have faltered]{.mark} since Erdogan renewed
calls for the extradition of Fethullah Gülen]{.underline}---a Turkish
political and religious leader in self-imposed exile in the United
States---whom Erdogan believes to be an organizer of the July 2016 coup.
[[Relations]{.mark} have [also suffered]{.mark} [because of the
United]{.mark} [States' close relationship with Kurdish
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}---the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[continues to supply arms to Peshmerga troops fighting the Islamic State
in Iraq and has provided arms to the Syrian
YPG]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and the increasingly close relationship
between Russia and Turkey.

#### Turkey- US relations worsening\-\--Turkey will sever ties with America unless they stops supporting YPG 

Matthew **Reisener** 9/12/**18**, a program associate at the Center for
the National Interest, \"Here\'s How to Save the U.S.-Turkey Alliance\",
The National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/heres-how-save-us-turkey-alliance-31152>

After decades of cooperation, the alliance between the United States and
the Republic of Turkey appears at risk of permanent fracture.
Disagreements over Syria, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's
creeping authoritarianism, and Turkey's decision to purchase the S-400
anti-aircraft missile system from Russia despite expressed objections
from the United States have caused this once-fruitful relationship to
turn toxic. Last month the Trump administration levied significant steel
and aluminum tariffs against Turkey only days after it imposed sanctions
on them for their continued imprisonment of American pastor Andrew
Brunson on spurious charges of espionage. Just last week, senior Cato
Institute fellow Doug Bandow argued in The National Interest that it is
time to bury the American-Turkish alliance once and for all.

[[While America's relations with Turkey]{.mark} [have]{.mark} certainly
[suffered]{.mark} of late, [they are not yet beyond
saving]{.mark}]{.underline}. Erdoğan's recent electoral victory, the
fragile state of Turkey's economy, and the decreasing need for American
involvement in the fight against Islamic State create a real opportunity
for both sides to meaningfully repair their alliance before further
deterioration occurs. While both Turkey and the United States have
legitimate grievances with one another, the U.S.-Turkey alliance remains
one worth attempting to preserve.

Turkey's long and productive relationship with the United States has
shown it can recover from a more serious rift than the one it currently
faces. Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952 due
to fears of Soviet encroachment and served as an important geopolitical
ally for the Western bloc. However, this partnership was severely tested
in 1975 when the United States enacted an arms embargo against Turkey in
response to its invasion of Cyprus, prompting Turkey to deny America
access to nearly all military bases in the country. After three years of
high tensions, the Carter administration acted to remove the embargo,
recognizing that the benefits of America's alliance with Turkey were
substantial enough to justify an honest attempt at repairing the
fractured diplomatic relationship.

Forty years later, Turkey and the United States once again find
themselves at odds. [Turkey]{.underline} was long viewed as a shining
example of democracy and secularism in the Middle East, but it [has
become increasingly authoritarian under Erdoğan's rule]{.underline},
resulting in the consolidation of executive power, the weakening of
civil society, and the targeting of journalists, activists, and
Erdoğan's political opponents. Turkey has also arrested many Americans,
including the aforementioned Andrew Brunson, in hopes that they could
pressure the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a
Pennsylvania-based Turkish religious leader who Erdoğan blames for
organizing an attempted coup against him in the summer of 2016. Instead,
America responded to the arrest of U.S. consulate employee Metin Topuz
by, "immediately suspending the issuance of non-immigrant visas in
Turkey," resulting in a diplomatic crisis.

However, Syria stands as arguably the most significant point of
divergence between the two allies. [[In the fight against]{.mark} the
[Islamic State]{.mark}, [America]{.mark} had [armed and
supported]{.mark} the People\'s Protection Units
[(YPG)]{.mark}]{.underline}, a Syrian Kurdish militia that composes the
bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The [[YPG was invaluable]{.mark}
as a [ground force against ISIS]{.mark}, [but their]{.mark} alleged
[support for]{.mark} the Kurdistan Workers\' Party
[(PKK]{.mark}),]{.underline} a Kurdish separatist group that has warred
with Turkey for forty years, [[aroused Turkish fears]{.mark} of a
pan-Kurdish military force that could threaten Turkey\'s southern
border. [Turkey view]{.mark}s [American support for the
Kurd]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} as support for an autonomous Kurdish
region in Syria [that [could threaten Turkey\'s territorial integrity
and control]{.mark} over its Kurdish population]{.underline}, while
[America sees Turkey\'s attacks against the YPG as counterproductive in
the broader fight against ISIS.]{.underline}

Turkey has certainly become an irritant to American foreign policy, but
it remains an extremely important military ally. [[Turkey]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} the [second largest military among]{.mark} all [NATO
members]{.mark} and is home to the permanent headquarters for NATO land
forces]{.underline}, as well as critical components of NATO\'s
early-warning missile radar system. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[also has a standing presence at Turkey\'s Incirlik
Airbase]{.mark}]{.underline} (utilized frequently in the fight against
ISIS) which hosts American tactical nuclear weapons and has allowed
America to project military power into the Middle East while offering
protection for regional allies. Turkey\'s growing authoritarianism is
undoubtedly a cause for concern, but America\'s partnerships with Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain prove that America can begrudgingly abide by
such alliances when they support America\'s broader goals[. [Turkey\'s
military prowes]{.underline}]{.mark}[s and strategic geographic
location]{.underline} as a bridge between Europe and Asia [[make it an
invaluable asset to]{.mark} both [America and NATO\'s defense
strategy]{.mark}, and preserving this asset is certainly in America\'s
national interest.]{.underline}

Additionally, [an **[American divorce from Turkey]{.mark} [would]{.mark}
likely [solidify]{.mark} the burgeoning [friendship between Turkey and
Russia]{.mark}**. [Turkey's desire to]{.mark} eschew a missile defense
system [integrat]{.mark}ed into NATO in favor of [Russia's S-400]{.mark}
[raises]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that
Russia could acquire data about]{.mark}]{.underline} how the stealth
capabilities [[American-made F-35]{.mark} matchup against the Russian
system]{.underline}. It [[also raises]{.mark} the [worry that Turkey\'s
commitment to NATO may be waning]{.mark}.]{.underline} After all, Russia
seeks to undermine the strength and influence of NATO in Eastern Europe
while protecting Russian presence and influence in the Middle East.
Moscow knows that supplanting the United States as the primary guarantor
of Turkish security would do much to accomplish these goals.

Still, [it is in Turkey's interest to repair its relationship with the
United States]{.underline}. Turkey's economy is on the brink of
collapse, and with Western nations accounting for nearly two-thirds of
its trade, now would be a particularly inopportune time for Turkey to
suffer a further loss of relations with its NATO partners. Erdoğan's
defiance in the face of Trump's tariffs shows that the disputes over
Syria and the Kurds are currently more important to him than protecting
the Turkish economy. [However, [considering Erdoğan's shortsighted
policies are]{.mark} partially [responsible for the economic crisis, he
may be willing to walk his relations with the West]{.mark}]{.underline}
back from the brink if given a mutually beneficial way to do so in the
interest of eliminating a threat that could undermine his credibility
with the Turkish public.

A simple first step towards nudging Erdoğan down that path is to appoint
an Ambassador to Turkey, a position that has remained vacant since 2017.
I previously argued that the absence of an American Ambassador to Turkey
makes it harder to create a meaningful framework for settling existing
disputes, and the fact that America has not filled this vacancy after
almost a year tells Turkey that repairing their alliance is not one of
America's priorities. [America's concerns regarding the S-400 system,
Erdoğan's authoritarianism, and the jailing of American citizens are
important issues worth pursuing,]{.underline} and [**[America is more
likely to reach favorable settlements]{.mark}** on each of them **[if it
appears fully committed to the diplomatic process]{.mark}**]{.underline}
than it will by imposing punitive and counterproductive tariffs.

The United States must also address the Kurdish and Syrian questions
from which the root of their poor relations with Turkey stem. The
destruction of the ISIS caliphate in Syria has created an opportunity
for Turkey and America to re-negotiate their relationships with the YPG.
While the United States must continue promoting dialogue and cooperation
with Syrian Kurdish groups, [**[it should also accelerate the process of
reclaiming]{.mark} the American [weapons it gave to the YPG]{.mark}**.
Moreover, America should condition future support for the YPG on the
group cutting ties with the PKK.]{.underline} Also, [[Washington
could]{.underline}]{.mark} offer to deepen its existing intelligence
sharing cooperation with Turkey to [[help stop the flow of money and
weapons to the PKK]{.mark} across Syria\'s porous borders]{.underline}.
Because ISIS can no longer acquire or hold territory in Syria, the
United States no longer needs to treat the YPG as a proxy force to
liberate occupied areas. This means [Washington should work to show
Turkey that American support for the protection of Syrian Kurds does not
extend to its support for an independent Kurdistan or a YPG/PKK
alliance]{.underline}.

The United States can further show its commitment to Turkey by
facilitating the reopening of peace talks between Ankara and the PKK,
which collapsed in 2015 due to Turkey's involvement in Syria. Erdoğan
effectively used his offensive against the PKK to rally public support
for his re-election bid this summer but may be more amenable in the
post-election environment if he observes the United States pressuring
the PKK into resuming the ceasefire that ended when the prior
negotiations did. [[Peace talks with the PKK would]{.mark}
[b]{.mark}e]{.underline} long, [[difficult]{.underline},]{.mark} and
provide no assurances of success, [[but showing]{.mark} that [America is
willing to stand beside Turkey]{.mark} through the duration of the
process [would]{.mark} certainly [improv]{.mark}e the [likelihood of
progress]{.mark} being made.]{.underline}

The [United States committed to repairing its relationship with Turkey
in 1978 and must be willing to make that same commitment in
2018]{.underline}. The process of preserving the U.S.-Turkey alliance
will be complex and will require deft and careful diplomacy. The damage
done may ultimately be unable to fully heal, especially if Erdoğan
proves unwilling to compromise even when faced with America's renewed
diplomatic vigor. However, [America's [alliance with Turkey is too
beneficial for the U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates [to
bury]{.mark}]{.underline} without first making every effort to
resuscitate it.

#### Collapsing US-Turkey relations causes Turkey proliferation and an Iran-Turkey nuclear war

**Ahval** 9/14/**18**, Ahval News,\"U.S.-Turkish break could lead to
nuclear nightmare - American Interest\",
https://ahvalnews.com/security/us-turkish-break-could-lead-nuclear-nightmare-american-interest

[[A]{.mark} clean strategic [break between Turkey and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could lead to a **nightmare scenario** of **rampant
nuclear prolif**]{.mark}**eration** [and]{.mark} devastating **[war in
the Middle East]{.mark}**, and should be avoided at all
costs]{.underline}, American Interest founding editor Adam Garfinkle
warned in an article published by the magazine on Sep. 3.

[[The]{.mark} diplomatic [crisis]{.mark} between the United States and
Turkey [has been caused by]{.mark}]{.underline} a complicated tangle of
issues, including the Turkish imprisonment of U.S. citizens and
employees, the purchase by Turkey of Russian missile defence systems
against NATO's wishes, and [**[U.S. support for Syrian-Kurdish
groups]{.mark}** designated as terrorist organisations by
Turkey.]{.underline}

These problems have been exacerbated by the personalities of the two
presidents in charge of the countries, said Garfinkle.

"Presidents Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan are too much alike as
political men: prideful narcissists who elevate personal loyalty over
law, "fact" fabricators who often speak before they think, and whose
exotic minds do not think well much of the time anyway," said Garfinkle.

[The severity of the resulting breakdown of relations and Erdoğan's
apparent unwillingness to compromise have led some experts in the United
States [to conclude that the relationship is beyond
saving.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This, however, [would be a grave mistake that would]{.mark} likely
[lead Turkey to pursue its own nuclear weapons]{.mark} programme, a move
that could have horrendous repercussions for regional
security]{.underline}, said Garfinkle.

[A break with the United States would mean the [removal of U.S.
bases]{.mark} from Turkish soil, as well as the nuclear weapons these
hold. And that [would result in a withdrawal of the "extended
deterrence"]{.mark} these weapons provide Turkey against its security
threats]{.underline}, Garfinkle said.

[[With nuclear armed states]{.mark}, including Pakistan, Israel, Russia,
the United Kingdom and France, [within striking distance of
Turkey]{.mark} on all sides, **[Ankara would feel]{.mark} the [pressure
to secure]{.mark} its defence by procuring [its own nuclear
weapons]{.mark},**]{.underline} the scholar said.

"If that happens, [the Turkish government could probably develop
deliverable nuclear warheads at least on its side of the ocean [within
two]{.mark} to three [years]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Garfinkle.

Moreover, [the existence of [a Turkish nuclear programme would spur
**Iran**]{.mark} to reinvigorate its own programme, [which could mean
**both countries becoming nuclear armed**]{.mark} in just three to five
years.]{.underline}

["The shock to the region would be profound, and possibly very
dangerous,"]{.underline} said Garfinkle.

[The change in Turkey's regional status from a NATO ally to a country
with a "truly independent, unfettered foreign policy" would only
compound that shock.]{.underline}

"When it comes to the Near East, the end of the U.S.-Turkish strategic
relationship would basically come down to this: [[Instead of Turkey
being part of a]{.mark} coherent, [stabilizing]{.mark}, and protective
[U.S.-led power in the region, it would play a more]{.mark} independent
and [divisive r]{.mark}ole]{.underline}," said Garfinkle.

Besides the loss of regional influence that would inevitably hit the
United States as a side effect of losing important bases on Turkish soil
including İncirlik in the south of the country[, a completely
[independent Turkey]{.mark}'s policies would be impossible to predict
and [could lead to]{.mark} terrifying scenarios]{.underline}, Garfinkle
warned.

"Some of the scenarios one can imagine are fairly stunning. For example,
there was an extended time, before the United States even existed, when
Turks and Persians tried to kill one another in large numbers,"
Garfinkle said.

"But as much tragedy as those wars caused back then, it pales in
comparison to the destruction that **[[an Iranian-Turkish nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** would cause in the 21st century for all the
peoples of the region," he said, adding that such a conflict [was not
inevitable but should not be ruled out.]{.underline}

"[It]{.underline} therefore [behooves everyone]{.underline}," Garfinkle
went on, "[to do everything possible to prevent the development of
additional independent nuclear weapons capabilities in or near the
Middle East."]{.underline}

"For the moment, everything possible certainly includes not threatening
to remove U.S. nuclear weapons from Turkey, let alone actually doing it,
for that would be the single most powerful motivating force behind a
Turkish decision to build its own nuclear weapons arsenal," he said.

#### Instability in Iraq will escalate\-\--tensions high

[Community [tensions and]{.mark} potential intercommunal [conflict in
Iraq may emerge over competition for resources]{.mark} as environmental
and agricultural degradation, decrease of water resources, and historic
lack of investment in infrastructure [take its
toll]{.mark}]{.underline}. Interconnected, displacement and migration
are also likely to create tensions between communities, as well as
competition over land and livelihoods of returnees post-IS. [In the
disputed territories]{.underline}, particularly Kirkuk, [the lack of
security provides the opportunity for intercommunal tensions to escalate
over ownership, whilst the continued presence of [militias]{.mark} also
[provides an opportunity for conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. In wider
Iraq the current government formation process is creating instability,
whilst [the protest movement]{.underline}3 [has the potential to
escalate, particularly as any new government will find it difficult to
meet the protestors demands. [The escalation of the protest movement has
the potential to]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[create
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} in the south -- through the protestors and
the government response -- but also [in the rest of the country [as
insecurity increases]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result.

### AS k2 Instability

#### Iraq government is not enforcing child protection laws--- supporting militias and being negligent about ISIL arming children 

Salam **Khoder 16-** Lebanese journalist and correspondent at Aljazeera
and general manager of Flair Media Consultancy June 8 2016 "Iraq\'s
child soldiers: \'What happened to our boys?\' " Al Jazeera
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/iraq-child-soldiers-happened-boys-160523122213988.html

Anbar, Iraq -- The child soldier posed for the camera, holding a
machine-gun and wearing black clothes and army boots. He refused to give
his name or his age, but it was obvious from his appearance - his facial
hair barely grown - that he was only a teenager. The boy fights along
with Hashd Al Ameriat - a shia militia.

The [[child soldier was fighting against]{.mark} Daesh ([ISIL]{.mark},
also known as ISIS]{.underline}) in Amiriyat al-Fallujah, a city 40
kilometres west of Baghdad, [where [fierce battles have been taking
place between Daesh, the Iraqi Army, and]{.mark} the \"[P]{.mark}opular
[M]{.mark}obilisation [F]{.mark}orces\" - [militias allied with the
Iraqi government]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On May 14, ISIL suicide bombers attacked the centre of Amiriyat
al-Fallujah, killing ten soldiers and militiamen. [[ISIL is]{.mark}
well-[known for its use of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}, and its
\"Cubs of the Caliphate\" brigade has been filmed undergoing military
training exercises and even taking part in executions.

"I fought alongside my brothers to liberate Tikrit and Baiji, and other
areas in Salahuddin province, and I will continue fighting with them as
long as it takes to claim back all the land from ISIL."- Karrar, fighter
from Diyala

**[[Iraq has a long history of training underage
fighters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Under Saddam Hussein\'s rule, [[boys of
12 to 17]{.mark} known as \"Saddam\'s lion cubs\" [would attend]{.mark}
month-long [training during summer]{.mark} breaks.]{.underline}

The [[Iraqi army restricts the age of its recruits]{.mark} to between 18
and 35, a policy that rights groups say is enforced. [But there is no
law governing the P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilisation
[F]{.mark}orces]{.underline}.

In December, the **[[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [documented
hundreds of cases of children recruited in Iraq and]{.mark} used to
[take part in hostilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"The reported
emergence of ISIL\'s \'youth wings\', with training centres in Iraq and
Syria, is extremely worrisome, as is the alleged association of children
with Popular Mobilisation Forces.\"

The United Nations Children\'s Fund called for \"urgent measures\" to be
taken by the Iraqi government to protect children, including
criminalising the recruitment of children.

The ban on child recruitment is found in Protocols I and II of the
Geneva Conventions, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other
international agreements. The Statute of the International Criminal
Court [([ICC) considers]{.mark} \"conscripting or [enlisting children\"
a war]{.mark} [crime]{.mark}, **[whether it takes place]{.mark} in
[international or local armed conflicts]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

A woman named Qetu Haji said several members of her family, who are
members of the Yazidi religious minority, were captured by Daesh while
trying to escape the group\'s advance in Sinjar. She was told by a
relative that her son had been killed and her daughter-in-law enslaved.

Two of her grandsons, aged 12 and 15, were reportedly put in a Daesh
military training camp. \"It is almost two years now, and I don\'t know
what happened to my grandsons,\" said Qetu Haji.

Other minors join ISIL\'s ranks willingly. Abu Muhannad, who lives in
Fallujah, said that after a siege on his city by the Iraqi army and
allied militias, his 17-year-old son Muhannad told him that \"he can\'t
understand why the army of his country is bombing its own people\".

Muhannad left the house that night, never to return, and his father
suspects he joined an ISIL training camp.

Ten months since his disappearance, the family still has no information
on his whereabouts. \"[They take our children, and leave us in
agony]{.underline} of what happened to our boys,\" said Abu Muhannad.
Yet [[ISIL is not the only group in Iraq that recruits children]{.mark}
as soldiers.]{.underline}

[[So do Iraqi Shia militias aligned with the Iraqi
government]{.mark}.]{.underline} While [it is not clear whether or not
these boys were forced to join]{.underline} the militias, those who
spoke to Al Jazeera said [many join]{.underline} these [militias of
their own volition, desiring revenge against ISIL.]{.underline}

Fifteen-year-old Karrar, who refused to give his last name, said he
joined the Asa\'ib Ahl al-Haq militia, which is fighting with the
Popular Mobilization Forces, \"to help liberate my people who are being
killed by ISIL\".

\"I fought alongside my brothers to liberate Tikrit and Baiji, and other
areas in Salahuddin province, and I will continue fighting with them as
long as it takes to claim back all the land from Daesh,\" said Karrar,
who is from Diyala, east of Baghdad. When asked about his young age, he
replied: \"My age doesn\'t matter. I am a fighter and I will remain a
fighter until Allah grants us victory or martyrdom.\"

Th large number of orphans in Iraq is also driving the use of child
soldiers. A report released by UNICEF in September 2015 estimated that
more than four million Iraqi children have lost at least one parent, and
Iraq lacks enough orphanages to host the large number of children who
have lost both parents.

In October 2014, the Iraqi Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs
announced that it runs just 22 orphanages across the country, and that
\"these houses are not capable at all of accommodating all those who
have lost a parent or both parents\".

\"The increasing numbers of orphans in the country with the lack of
proper care will put them at the mercy of armed militias,\" said Abir
al-Shammari, who runs the Right to Humanity organisation, a Basra-based
NGO that operates mainly in southern Iraq. Al-Shammari is critical of
the Iraqi government for not funding more orphanages to care for the
children.

The **[[Iraqi government]{.mark} has [failed to halt militias\'
recruitment of children]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hawker Jetto, a
sociologist and a human rights activist based in Erbil who works in a
public aid organisation that deals with human rights in Iraq, argues
that **[Iraq \"is [clearly violating the Geneva conventions, by
neglecting the increasing number of children-soldiers]{.mark} who are
recruited by militias affiliated with the government]{.underline}**\".

Jetto criticises the Iraqi government for not putting \"the Popular
Mobilisation Forces under the supervision of an official committee, to
stop any abuses against children\".

Both the Iraqi Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Interior refused to
comment on militia recruitment of children, and declined to give
estimates of the number of children fighting in the conflict.

Jetto believes that \"the **[[government might be as well considered as
complicit]{.mark} in the violation of children\'s rights with militia
leaders]{.underline}**\".

\"[[If the government does not act]{.mark} fast [to stop child
abuse]{.mark} in the conflict, [it must be held
accountable]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

#### Iraq's instability is allowing PMF militias to challenge the government for control 

Renad **Mansour 18**- Senior Research Fellow, Iraq Institute for
Strategic Studies, PhD in Politics and International Studies, University
of Cambridge April 3, 2018 "MORE THAN MILITIAS: IRAQ'S POPULAR
MOBILIZATION FORCES ARE HERE TO STAY"
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/more-than-militias-iraqs-popular-mobilization-forces-are-here-to-stay/>

While traditional security-sector reform would have sought to integrate
the PMF and other armed groups into a single command structure, under
either the defense or interior ministries, the PMF has managed to carve
out an autonomous space. It will penetrate state institutions, but not
the way it would have under a more conventional integration framework.

[[PMF leaders argue]{.mark} that their autonomous [position]{.mark}
under the NSC [is not so unusual]{.mark} --- [it has been done before
with]{.mark}]{.underline} Iraq's Counter-Terrorism Service (also known
as the Golden Divisions or [[CTS)]{.underline}.]{.mark} Even Abadi is
reported to have made the comparison. In 2007, Maliki took the CTS out
from under the strict control of the Ministry of Defence and brought it
under the prime minister's office as part of the NSC civilian oversight
process. At the time, many analysts argued against taking the CTS out of
institutionalized chains of command because it put the service in
unclear legal waters and made it answerable to the prime minister rather
than traditional security institutions.

[[During the fight against ISIL]{.underline}]{.mark}, however[, many
commentators changed their minds, and [the CTS became the most
celebrated fighting force]{.mark}]{.underline} on the frontline
liberating Iraqi territory. [Today, few question the service's legal
standing.]{.underline} Moreover, the CTS was recently granted a
ceremonial quasi-ministerial status to put it on the same level as the
other security ministries under the NSC. The PMF does not yet have this
standing, but it is an equal partner in the NSC and seems to be striving
to replicate the CTS precedent.

Although both are autonomous entities under the Prime Minister's Office,
the PMF is not the CTS. The CTS has a focused and limited security
mandate (counter-terrorism missions). While it is no longer under the
Ministry of Defense command structure, [it is still aligned with army
strategies and firmly under government control]{.underline}. Its
activities reinforce the government's monopoly on violence and the
overall strength of the state. By contrast, [[PMF activities are]{.mark}
much [broader]{.mark}. Currently, **[its military role is more visible
outside Baghdad]{.mark}**,]{.underline} particularly in the provinces of
Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewah, and Salahadeen. In these areas, [the [PMF
serves as a sort of national guard]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} **has
[recruited]{.mark} [locals]{.mark} to patrol borders and checkpoints.**
However, the [command structure does not necessarily go up to]{.mark}
the [p]{.mark}rime [m]{.mark}inister]{.underline}, who serves as
commander-in-chief. In fact, oftentimes [the groups compete with state
forces over checkpoints and operations]{.underline}.

The **[[PMF challenges the government's position]{.mark} not only [in
the security realm, but also in politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It
wields significant political power given the Fatah Alliance's upcoming
electoral run and its influence over political actors and state
institutions. [Although some PMF leaders have switched their army
fatigues for suits in an effort to separate politics from security, [the
line often remains blurred]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, following
budget negotiations last month, [Fatah leaders argued that the PMF
should be granted the same pay and pension allocations as the Iraqi
armed forces]{.underline}. In this instance, Fatah acted as a political
organization that could lobby on behalf of the PMF.

The [paramilitaries also hold formal and informal economic
power]{.underline}. Unlike the websites of the Ministry of Defence,
Ministry of Interior, or CTS, the PMF's website includes a strong focus
on its rebuilding efforts all over Iraq. For instance, in Basra, trucks
with the PMF logo have begun rebuilding roads and infrastructure. In
Baghdad, the PMF have advertised their role in rebuilding a medical
clinic. In recently liberated areas, PMF checkpoints collect taxes and
tariffs and facilitate the transport of formal and informal trade left
in ISIL's wake.

The PMF has used its unique status to move back and forth between formal
and informal spaces, as its interests dictate.
[[Baghdad]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[allowed]{.mark} the [militias to
institutionalize]{.mark} their [role as part of the state, while
maintaining autonomy as]{.mark} an [independent security, political, and
economic actor]{.mark}.]{.underline} The PMF retains the image and
prominence of a state actor but the autonomy of a non-state actor. For
instance, [[if it faces too much resistance]{.mark} from the state, or
does not win enough seats in the upcoming elections, the [PMF can revert
back to]{.mark} its [paramilitary status with minimal concern for
pushback]{.mark} from the state. **The [weakness of Iraq's]{.mark}
i[nstitutions]{.mark} [affords]{.mark} the PMF [the flexibility to
simultaneously cooperate with and compete against the state for
power]{.mark}, legitimacy, and capacity**]{.underline}.

#### Iraqi government supports terrorist and arms groups using child soldiers\-\-- lack of control and instability fueling militias 

Alissa J. **Rubin 19**- Baghdad Bureau chief for The New York Times. May
7, 2019 "Iraq's Militias, Accused of Threatening U.S., Pose a Quandary
for Iraq" New York Times
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/world/middleeast/iraq-militias-iran-united-states.html

[[There are roughly 30 of the militias, known as the Popular
Mobilization Forces]{.mark}, with at least 125,000 active-duty
fighters.]{.underline}

Members of the pro-Iranian militia Harakat al-Nujaba watched an address
by Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on a screen during a rally near
Beirut, Lebanon, last year.

[Their relationships with Iran vary]{.underline} widely, according to
experts and government officials in Iraq and Washington. [Some Popular
Mobilization groups keep their distance from Iran while others ---
including some of the most powerful --- are deeply intertwined with
it.]{.underline}

Now that the fight against the Islamic State has dwindled, [the problem
facing Iraq is what to do with these groups.]{.underline} While [[there
has been talk of having them disband]{.mark} and disarm, [only a couple
of them seem willing to do so]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although [**[the militias have been absorbed into the Iraqi security
forces]{.mark}, they are not under the command of either the Defense or
Interior Ministries. Instead, [they enjoy a special status, reporting to
the prime minister]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Some of the groups seem relatively benign and carry out almost
exclusively local responsibilities, providing policing services where
the police are in short supply.

However, **[[others are corrupt, behaving like mafias]{.mark}, and
[several have been accused of human rights
abuses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And [[while they report to the prime
minister]{.mark}, [it is not clear]{.mark} that [anyone]{.mark} really
[can restrain them]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"If they have armed wings and are corrupt, no one can control them,"
former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in an interview this year.

A major concern among some officials is that, much like Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, they will go into business, but with the
unfair advantage of having armed men behind them and the implicit
protection of senior figures in the Iraqi government.

"In Iraq if you don't put controls on these groups, you will have these
guys morph into networks that will range from semi-criminal entities to
politically predatory forces that would act as a state within a state,"
said Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute.

It is the [four or five [groups with the closest ties to Iran]{.mark}
that [are seen as exercising unauthorized power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Some run kickback schemes on a local level, using coercion to force
business people to give them a piece of the action or compel citizens to
use their services.

**[[Many]{.mark} of these [groups have large numbers of representatives
in the Iraqi Parliament]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where the power to
designate ministers is divided among the political blocs. If a bloc or a
party controls who becomes a minister, they have a chance to influence
who gets valuable contracts or jobs.

These groups also can act as a lobby for Iranian interests within the
Iraqi state.

Senior [Iraqi [government officials worry]{.mark} privately [about the
influence of the groups]{.mark} that have proved closest to Iran and are
impervious to efforts to bring them under the government's control,
[but]{.mark} the officials [are]{.mark} generally [reluctant to speak
publicly about it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Defense Ministry was angry when some of the Popular Mobilization's
brigades moved to the Syrian border in November, taking up crucial
positions, but the ministry worked out a way of avoiding a confrontation
with them.

Similarly, soon after the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates Treasury
Department [announced]{.mark} in March [it was listing one of the
Popular Mobilization groups]{.mark}, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, [as a
foreign terrorist organization]{.mark}, [the Iraqi government made clear
it disagreed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi]{.mark}]{.underline} did not defend
the group by name --- al-Nujaba has proved difficult for the Iraqi
military to work with at times --- but he did support the Popular
Mobilization groups.

"The Americans can make the decisions they want, but the Americans see
things differently from the way we do, and [our attitude toward the
Popular Mobilization is well known and clear]{.underline}," he [[said in
March]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[[We respect all]{.mark} of the groups of
the [P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization [that made
sacrifices]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The sacrifices he was alluding to were largely made from 2014 through
2016, when the Islamic State swept across northern Iraq with little
resistance and was moving fast toward the capital. Urged by a call in
June 2014 from Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's influential Shiite
spiritual leader, for volunteers to defend their nation, young men and
old formed a pickup army.

Iran sent some Iraqis who were fighting with them in Syria, on behalf of
President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian Army, back to Iraq to confront the
threat on their home turf.

In places where the Iraqi Army collapsed in the face of the Islamic
State, the Popular Mobilization Forces went in: They secured roads,
fought the Islamic State and cut off their escape routes. **[[Iran
helped the P]{.mark}opular [M]{.mark}obilization [acquire weapons and
supplies, but gradually that role was taken over by the Iraqi
government]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

At the time, the Popular Mobilization groups "did a lot of good and
sacrificed with their blood" to help save the country from the Islamic
State, said Wafiq al-Hashimi, a political scientist at the Iraq
Strategic Studies Group.

However, in [[area]{.mark}s [where they defeated the Islamic
State]{.mark}, [some militias took over the extremists' illegal
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, enriching themselves but doing little
for local communities. These groups, most notably in northern Iraq,
fought Iraqi government forces as recently as last year to hold on to
their oil smuggling business. They ultimately lost, but still have bases
near the now-capped oil wells.

At **[[least a couple]{.mark} of the [P]{.mark}opular
[M]{.mark}obilization [groups]{.mark} [are led by figures who attacked
American forces]{.mark} in the years after the United States invaded
Iraq,]{.underline}** making any threats against United States forces and
civilians in the region particularly worrying to officials.

### Yes US-Iran War

#### Miscalc in the middle east [leads to nuclear war]{.underline} AND cyber war \-\-- That causes [mass death]{.underline} 

Alex **Ward 19**
<https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/8/18693297/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq>
Alex Ward is a staff writer covering international security and defense
issues, as well as a co-host of Vox\'s \"Worldly\" podcast. "A "nasty
brutal fight" -- What a us iran war would look like"

A deadly opening attack. Nearly untraceable, ruthless proxies spreading
chaos on multiple continents. Costly miscalculations. And thousands ---
perhaps hundreds of thousands --- killed in a conflict that would dwarf
the war in Iraq.

[Welcome to the [US-Iran war]{.mark}, which [has the potential to be one
of the worst conflicts in history]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Washington and Tehran remain locked in a [**months-long
standoff**](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18628977/us-iran-war-trump-oil-tanker-attacks-nuclear-program-pompeo-bolton-irgc) with
no end in sight. [The US has imposed crushing sanctions on Iran's
economy over its support for terrorism and its growing missile program,
among other things, after withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal last
year; [Iran has fought back by violating parts of the nuclear agreement
and downing an American military drone.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To hear [**President Donald
Trump**](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18700570/trump-iran-attack-drone-twitter) tell
it, that last incident brought the US within 10 minutes of launching
warplanes and dropping bombs on Iran. Had Trump gone through with the
planned strike[, it's possible both nations would now be engaged in a
much more violent, much bloodier struggle.]{.underline}

Importantly, both country's leaders say they don't want a war[. But the
possibility of one breaking out anyway shouldn't be discounted,
especially since an Iranian insult directed
at [**[Trump]{.mark}**](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/25/18744444/trump-iran-attack-twitter-obliteration-force) last
month led him to [threatened the Islamic Republic's "obliteration" for
an attack on "anything American."]{.mark} In other words, [Tehran
doesn't have to kill any US troops, diplomats, or citizens to warrant a
military response --- it just has to try.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Replying to
\@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/_/status/1143529905323479041)

\....Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only
shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on
anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some
areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!

Which means **[[the standstill between the US and Iran teeters on a
knife edge, and it won't take much to knock it
off.]{.underline}]{.mark}** So to understand how bad it could get, I
asked eight current and former White House, Pentagon, and intelligence
officials, as well as Middle East experts, how a war between the US and
Iran might play out.

The bottom line: It would be hell on earth.

"This would be a violent convulsion similar to chaos of the Arab Spring
inflicted on the region for years," said Ilan Goldenberg, the Defense
Department's Iran team chief from 2009 to 2012, with the potential for
it to get "so much worse than Iraq."

US-imposed sanctions have tanked Iran's economy, and Tehran desperately
wants them lifted. But with few options to compel the Trump
administration to change course[, [**Iranian leaders may choose a more
violent
tactic**](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18700732/iran-drone-attack-trump-maximum-pressure) to
make their point.]{.underline}

[[Iranian forces could bomb an American oil tanker]{.mark} traveling
through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for the global energy
trade aggressively patrolled by Tehran's forces, [causing loss of life
or a catastrophic oil spill]{.mark}. The country's [**skillful
hackers**](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/01/iran-linked-hackers-said-to-be-ready-for-attacks-on-u-s-targets/) could
launch a major cyberattack on regional allies like Saudi Arabia or the
United Arab Emirates.]{.underline}

[**Israel could kill an Iranian nuclear
scientist**](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/05/israel-assassination-iranian-scientists-217223),
leading Iran to strike back and drawing the US into the spat, especially
if Tehran responds forcefully. Or Iranian-linked proxies could [**target
and murder American troops and
diplomats**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/this-is-how-easily-the-us-and-iran-could-blunder-into-war/2019/05/23/40dbbcae-7c07-11e9-8ede-f4abf521ef17_story.html?utm_term=.5b9c990261b7) in
Iraq.

[That last option is particularly likely, experts say. After all,
Iran [**bombed US Marine barracks in
Lebanon**](https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/13/world/meast/beirut-marine-barracks-bombing-fast-facts/index.html) in
1983 and killed more than [**600 US
troops**](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/04/04/iran-killed-more-us-troops-in-iraq-than-previously-known-pentagon-says/) during
the Iraq War. Taking this step may seem extreme, but "Iran could
convince itself that it could do this," Goldenberg, now at the Center
for a New American Security think tank in Washington, told
me.]{.underline}

[At that point, it'd be nearly impossible for the Trump administration
not to respond in kind. The recommendations given to the president would
correspond to whatever action Iran took.]{.underline}

[If Tehran destroyed an oil tanker, killing people and causing an oil
spill, the US might destroy some of Iran's ships. If Iran took out
another US military drone, the US might take out some of Iran's air
defenses. And if Iranian-backed militants killed Americans in Iraq, then
US troops stationed there could retaliate, killing militia fighters and
targeting their bases of operation in return. The US could even bomb
certain training grounds inside Iran.]{.underline}

tanker attacked in the waters of the Gulf of Oman on June]{.underline}
13, 2019. The US blames Iran for the bombing. *AFP/Getty Images*

It's at this point that both sides would need to communicate their red
lines to each other and how not to cross them. The problem [is [there
are [**no direct
channels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-communication-insight/why-u-s-iran-tensions-could-quickly-escalate-into-a-crisis-idUSKCN1SU11V) between
the two countries]{.mark} and they don't particularly trust each other.
So [the situation could easily spiral out of
contro]{.mark}l.]{.underline}

[Messaging "is often more important than physical action,"]{.underline}
Jasmine El-Gamal, formerly a Middle East adviser at the Pentagon, told
me. "Action without corresponding messaging, public or private, could
most certainly lead to escalation because the other side is free to
interpret the action as they wish."

Which means the initial tit-for-tat would serve as the precursor to much
more bloodshed.

You may have heard the phrase [**"the fog of
war."**](https://www.clausewitz.com/bibl/Kiesling-OnFog.pdf) It refers
to how hard it is for [opposing sides to know what's going on in the
heat of battle. It's particularly difficult when they don't talk to one
another, as is the case with the US and Iran.]{.underline}

[Which means that the way [the US and Iran interpret each other's next
moves would mainly come down to guesswork]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Eric Brewer, who spent years in the intelligence community before
joining Trump's National Security Council to work on Iran, told me
that's when the Pentagon and other parts of the government rely heavily
on their best-laid plans.

The problem, he noted, is that wars rarely play out as even the smartest
officials think they will. A guiding question for him, then, is "what
are we going to be wrong about?"

[Here's one scenario in which the US might get something wrong --- and
open up the door to chaos: After America launches its first set of
retaliatory strikes, Iran decides to scatter its missiles to different
parts of the country.]{.underline}

[Now the Trump administration has to figure out why Iran did that. Some
[people in the admin]{.mark}istration might [think]{.mark} it's because
[Tehran plans to attack US embassies,]{.mark} [troops, or allies in the
region and is moving its missiles into position to do so]{.mark}. Others
might believe that it was merely for defensive reasons, with Iran
essentially trying to protect its missile arsenal from being taken out
by future US strikes.]{.underline}

MESSAGING "IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN PHYSICAL ACTION" ---JASMINE
EL-GAMAL, FORMER MIDDLE EAST ADVISER AT THE PENTAGON

Without a clear answer, which interpretation wins out comes down to
which camp in the Trump administration is the most persuasive. And if
the camp that believes Iran is about to launch missile strikes wins,
they could convince the president to take preemptive action against
Iran.

That could be a good thing if they were right; after all, they'd have
made sure Iran couldn't carry out those planned attacks. But what if
they were wrong[? [What if]{.mark} the other camp guessed correctly that
[Iran was merely moving its missiles around because it was scared the US
would strike]{.mark} once more? In that case, [the US would]{.mark} have
bombed [Iran]{.mark} again, this time [for]{.mark} essentially [no
reason]{.mark} --- thus looking like the aggressor.]{.underline}

[[That could cause Iran to retaliate with a bigger attack,]{.mark}
setting off a spiral [that could end in full-scale
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Iran could make a grave error too. Imagine [**Trump sends thousands of
troops**](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18683337/us-iran-war-1000-troops),
say 25,000, along with [**advanced
warplanes**](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/28/politics/us-f-22-fighters-to-qatar-intl-hnk/index.html) to
the Middle East in the hope that they'll deter Iran from escalating the
conflict any further.

Tehran could just as easily read that buildup as preparation for a US
invasion. If that's the case, Iranian forces could choose to strike
first in an effort to complicate the perceived incursion.

Of course, cooler heads could prevail in those moments. But experts say
[[the political pressures on]{.mark} both [Washington and Tehran]{.mark}
not to be attacked first --- and [not to]{.mark} be embarrassed or [look
weak]{.mark} --- [might be too strong for the countries' leaders to
ignore.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[Unintended [civilian casualties or other collateral damage is always
possib]{.mark}le, and [it is not clear that this]{.mark}
[admin]{.mark}istration --- or any administration --- [understands what
Iran's]{.mark} own [red lines are]{.mark},"]{.underline} El-Gamal, now
at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, told me. "As such, the
greatest risk of a full-blown war comes from one side miscalculating the
other's tolerance" for conflict.

If that proves true, and the US and Iran officially escalate their
fighting to more than a few one-off attacks, it's war.

[At this point, it's hard to be very precise about a hypothetical
[full-blown conflict]{.mark}. We know it [would]{.mark} feature a series
of moves and countermoves, we know it'd be very messy and confusing, and
we know it'd [be extremely deadly]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But unlike with the path to war, it's less useful to offer a
play-by-play of what could happen. So with that in mind, it's better to
look at what the US and Iranian war plans would likely be --- to better
understand the devastation each could exact.

The US strategy would almost certainly involve using overwhelming air
and naval power to beat Iran into submission early on. "You don't poke
the beehive, you take the whole thing down," Goldenberg said.

[The US military would bomb Iranian ships, parked warplanes, missile
sites, nuclear facilities, and training grounds, as well as launch
cyberattacks on much of the country's military
infrastructure]{.underline}. The goal would be to degrade Iran's
conventional forces within the first few days and weeks, making it even
harder for Tehran to resist American strength.

[That plan definitely makes sense as an opening salvo, experts say, but
it will come nowhere close to winning the war.]{.underline}

[["It's very unlikely that the Iranians would capitulate]{.mark},"
Michael Hanna, a Middle East expert at the Century Foundation in New
York, told me. "[It's]{.mark} almost [impossible]{.mark} [to
imagine]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} massive [air campaign will produce the
desired result]{.mark}. [It's only going to produce escalation]{.mark},
not surrender."]{.underline}

It won't help that a sustained barrage of airstrikes will likely lead to
hundreds of Iranians dead, among them innocent civilians. That, among
other things, could galvanize Iranian society against the US and put it
firmly behind the regime, even though it has in many ways treated the
population horribly over decades in power.

There's another risk: A [**2002 war
game**](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/06/opinion/how-we-won-the-war.html) showed
[that [Iran could sink an American ship]{.mark} and kill US sailors,
even though the US Navy is far more powerful[. If the Islamic Republic's
forces succeeded in doing that]{.mark}, it could provide a searing
[image that could serve as a propaganda coup for the
Iranians]{.mark}]{.underline}. Washington won't garner the same amount
of enthusiasm for destroying Iranian warships --- that's what's supposed
to happen.

[**Trump**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-war-with-iran-would-not-involve-ground-troops-and-not-last-long/2019/06/26/9a0e9918-9813-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html?utm_term=.79c38ef752bf) has
already signaled he doesn't want to send ground troops into Iran or even
spend a long time fighting the country. That tracks with his own
inclinations to keep the US out of foreign wars, particularly in the
Middle East[. But with hawkish aides at his side, like [**National
Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo**](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18628977/us-iran-war-trump-oil-tanker-attacks-nuclear-program-pompeo-bolton-irgc),
there's a chance they could convince him not to look weak and to go
all-in and grasp victory.]{.underline}

But the options facing the president at that point will be extremely
problematic, experts say.

The riskiest one --- by far --- would be to invade Iran. The logistics
alone boggle the mind, and any attempt to try it would be seen from
miles away. "There's no surprise invasion of Iran," Brewer, who is now
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in
Washington, told me.

[[**Iran**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/20/war-with-iran-would-be-mother-all-quagmires/?utm_term=.0f0cf4dbdccd) has
nearly three times the amount of people Iraq did in 2003, when the war
began, and is about three and a half times as big. In fact, it's the
world's 17th-largest country, with territory greater than [**France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal
combined**](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/no-easy-war-here-why-america-isnt-invading-iran-anytime-soon-26586)]{.underline}.

The geography is also treacherous. It has small mountain ranges along
some of its borders. Entering from the Afghanistan side in the east
would mean traversing two deserts. Trying to get in from the west could
also prove difficult even with Turkey --- a NATO ally --- as a bordering
nation. After all, Ankara wouldn't let the US use Turkey to invade Iraq,
and its [**relations with Washington have only
soured**](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/4/11/18292070/usa-turkey-trump-erdogan-s400) since.

The US could try to enter Iran the way Saddam Hussein did during the
Iran-Iraq war, near a water pass bordering Iran's southwest. But it's
swampy --- the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet there --- and relatively
easy to protect. Plus, an invading force would run up against the Zagros
Mountains after passing through, just like Saddam's forces did.

It's for these reasons that the private intelligence firm Stratfor
called Iran
a [**"fortress"**](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/geopolitics-iran-holding-center-mountain-fortress) back
in 2011. If Trump chose to launch an incursion, he'd likely need
around [**1.6 million
troops**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/20/war-with-iran-would-be-mother-all-quagmires/?utm_term=.0f0cf4dbdccd) to
take control of the capital and country, a force so big it would
overwhelm America's ability to host them in regional bases. By contrast,
America never had more than [**180,000 service members in
Iraq**](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/iraqschallenge/2011/06/201162864733970544.html).

[And there's the human cost. A US-Iran war would likely lead to
thousands or hundreds of thousands of dead. Trying to forcibly remove
the country's leadership, experts say, might drive that total into the
millions.]{.underline}

That helps explain why nations in the region hope they won't see a
fight. Goldenberg, who traveled last month to meet with officials in the
Gulf, said that none of them wanted a US-Iran war. European nations will
also worry greatly about millions of refugees streaming into the
continent, which would put immense pressure on governments already
dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis. Israel also would
worry about Iranian proxies targeting it (more on that below).

[Meanwhile[, countries like Russia and China]{.mark} --- both friendly
to Iran --- [would try to curtail the fighting and exploit it at the
same time]{.mark}, the Century Foundation's Hanna told me. [China
depends heavily on its goods]{.mark} traveling through the Strait of
Hormuz, [so it would probably call for calm and for Tehran not to close
down the waterway]{.mark}. Russia would likely demand restraint as well,
but use the opportunity to solidify its ties with the Islamic
Republic.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia, stand side by side in the group picture at the G20 summit

And since both countries have veto power on the UN Security Council,
they could ruin any political legitimacy for the war that the US may aim
to gain through that body.

The hope for the Trump administration would therefore be that the
conflict ends soon after the opening salvos begin. If it doesn't, and
Iran resists, all that'd really be left are a slew of bad options to
make a horrid situation muc

Retired Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart left his post as the No. 2 at US
Cyber Command earlier this year, ending a decorated four-decade career.
Toward the end of it, he spent his time at the forefront of the military
intelligence and cybersecurity communities.

If anyone has the most up-to-date information on how Iran may fight the
US, then, it's Stewart.

"[The Iranian strategy would be to avoid, where possible, direct
conventional force-on-force operations," he wrote for [**the Cipher
Brief**](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/article/cyber/iran-strikes-back?utm_source=Join+the+Community+Subscribers&utm_campaign=002714cc81-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_07_02_12_20&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_02cbee778d-002714cc81-122654717&mc_cid=002714cc81&mc_eid=cc5a8ac00f) on
July 2. "They would attempt to impose cost on a global scale, striking
at US interests through cyber operations and targeted terrorism with the
intent of expanding the conflict, while encouraging the international
community to restrain America's actions."]{.underline}

In other words, Tehran can't match Washington's firepower. But it can
spread chaos in the Middle East and around the world, hoping that a
war-weary US public, an intervention-skeptical president, and an angered
international community cause America to stand down.

That may seem like a huge task --- and it is --- but experts believe the
Islamic Republic has the capability, knowhow, and will to pull off such
an ambitious campaign. "The Iranians can escalate the situation in a lot
of different ways and in a lot of different places," Hanna told me.
"They have the capacity to do a lot of damage."

Take what it could do in the Middle East. [**Iran's vast network of
proxies**](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-shia-militia-mapping-project) and
elite units --- like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps --- could be
activated to kill American troops, diplomats, and citizens throughout
the region. US troops in Syria are poorly defended and have little
support, making them easy targets, experts say. America also has
thousands of civilians, troops, and contractors in Iraq, many of whom
work in areas near where Iranian militias operate within the country.

US allies would also be prime
targets[. [**[Hezbollah]{.underline}**](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18628977/us-iran-war-trump-oil-tanker-attacks-nuclear-program-pompeo-bolton-irgc)]{.mark}[,
an Iran-backed terrorist group in Lebanon[, **might attack
Israel**]{.mark} with rockets [and start its own]{.mark} brutal
[fight]{.mark}. We've heard this story before: In 2006, they battled in
a month-long war where the militant group fired more than [**4,000
rockets**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israeli-airstrikes-target-syrian-research-center-linked-to-chemical-weapons/2017/09/07/2230abda-93a5-11e7-b9bc-b2f7903bab0d_story.html?utm_term=.a6f557e10594) into
Israel, and Israeli forces fired around [**7,000 bombs and
missiles**](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/09/05/why-they-died/civilian-casualties-lebanon-during-2006-war) into
Lebanon.]{.underline}

About [**160**](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/terrorism/hizbullah/pages/israel-hizbullah%20conflict-%20victims%20of%20rocket%20attacks%20and%20idf%20casualties%20july-aug%202006.aspx) Israelis
troops and civilians died, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, and about 1,100 Lebanese --- most of them civilians ---
perished, per Human Rights Watch, a US-headquartered advocacy
organization. It
also [**reports**](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/09/05/why-they-died/civilian-casualties-lebanon-during-2006-war) about
4,400 Lebanese were injured, and around 1 million people were displaced.

But that's not all. Iran could encourage terrorist organizations or
other proxies to strike inside Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
and other Gulf nations. Its support for Houthis rebels in Yemen would
mostly certainly increase, offering them more weapons and funds to
attack Saudi Arabia's airports, military bases, and energy plants.

The US government on April 8, 2019, said it had designated the IRGC as a
terrorist organization, marking the first time a US government has made
such a designation on a foreign government's organization. *Rouzbeh

[Experts note that the Islamic Republic surely has sleeper cells in
Europe and Latin America, and they could resurface in dramatic and
violent ways. In 1994, for example, Iranian-linked terrorists bombed the
hub of the Jewish community in Argentina's capital, [**Buenos
Aires**](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Iran-Argentina-and-), killing 85
people and injuring roughly 300 more]{.underline}.

That remains the largest terrorist attack in Latin America's history,
and the possibility for an even bigger one exists. Last
year, [**Argentina**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/argentina-arrests-men-suspected-links-hezbollah-181116074024134.html) arrested
two men suspected of having ties with Hezbollah.

But Chris Musselman, formerly the National Security Council's
counterterrorism director under Trump, told me the US and its allies may
have the most trouble containing the proxy swarm in Western Africa.

"[We could see a conflict that spread quickly to places the US may not
be able to protect people, and it's a fight that we are grossly
unprepared for," he]{.underline} told me, adding that there's a strong
Hezbollah presence in the region and American embassy security there
isn't great. Making matters worse, he continued, the US isn't
particularly good at collecting intelligence there, meaning some
militants could operate relatively under the radar.

"This isn't really a law enforcement function that US can take on a
global scale," he said. It would require that countries unwittingly
hosting proxies to lead on defeating the Iranian-linked fighters, with
US support when needed.

[The [chaos would also extend into the cyber
realm]{.mark}. [[**Iran**](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/29/18643920/iran-facebook-twitter-instagram-fake-account) is
a major threat to the US in cyberspace.]{.mark} Starting in 2011, [Iran
attacked [**more than 40 American
banks**](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F547683%2Fthe-perfect-weapon-by-david-e-sanger%2F9780451497895%2F)]{.mark},
including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The attack made it so the
banks had trouble serving its customers and customers had trouble using
the bank's services.]{.underline}

[In 2012, Iran released [**malware into the networks of Saudi
Aramco**](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/business/global/cyberattack-on-saudi-oil-firm-disquiets-us.html),
a major oil company, which erased documents, emails, and other files on
around 75 percent of the company's computers --- replacing them with an
image of a burning American flag.]{.underline}

In the middle of a war, one could imagine Tehran's hackers wreaking even
more havoc.

"I would expect them to have begun selected targeting through
socially-engineered phishing activities focused on the oil and gas
sector, the financial sector and the electric power grid in that order,"
Stewart wrote. "There may be instances now where they already have some
persistent access. If they do, I expect they would use it, or risk
losing the access and employ that capability early in the escalation of
the crisis."

[Recent reports indicate that [**Iranian cyberwarriors have stepped up
their online
operations**](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/01/iran-linked-hackers-said-to-be-ready-for-attacks-on-u-s-targets/),
with a particular emphasis on preparing to attack US firms. Among other
moves, they're aiming to trick employees at major businesses to hand
over passwords and other vital information, giving them greater access
to a firm's networks.]{.underline}

"When you combine this increase with past destructive attacks launched
by Iranian-linked actors, we're concerned enough about the potential for
new destructive attacks to continue sounding the alarm," Christopher
Krebs, a top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland
Security, told [**Foreign
Policy**](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/01/iran-linked-hackers-said-to-be-ready-for-attacks-on-u-s-targets/) on
July 1.

[All of this --- proxies striking around the world, cyberattacks on
enterprise --- would happen while Iran continued to resist conventional
American forces.]{.underline}

In the Strait of Hormuz, for instance, Iranian sailors could use
speedboats to place bombs on oil tankers or place mines in the water to
destroy US warships. The Islamic Republic's submarines would also play a
huge part in trying to sink an American vessel. And the
nation's [**anti-ship
missiles**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/20/war-with-iran-would-be-mother-all-quagmires/?utm_term=.0f0cf4dbdccd) and
drones could prove constant and deadly nuisances.

[Should US troops try to enter Iranian territory on land, Iranian ground
forces would also push back on them fiercely using insurgent-like
tactics while the US painfully marches toward Tehran.]{.underline}

Put together, Brewer notes succinctly, a US-Iran war would be "a nasty,
brutal fight."

Imagine, as we already have, that the earlier stages of strife escalate
to a major war. That's already bad enough. But assume for a moment not
only that the fighting takes place, but that the US does the unlikely
and near impossible: It invades and overthrows the Iranian regime (which
National Security Adviser Bolton, at least, has openly called for in the
past).

If that happens, it's worth keeping two things in mind.

[First, experts say upward of [a million people]{.mark} --- troops from
both sides as well as Iranian men, women, and children, and American
diplomats and contractors --- likely [will have died]{.mark} by that
point. Cities will burn and smolder. [Those who survived the conflict
will]{.mark} mainly [live in a state of economic devastation for years
and some, perhaps, will pick up arms and form insurgent groups to fight
the invading US force.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Second, power abhors a vacuum. [[With no]{.mark} entrenched
[regime]{.mark} in place, [multiple authority figures from
Iran]{.mark}'s clerical and military circles, among others, [will jockey
for control]{.mark}. Those sides could split into violent factions,
[initiating a civil war]{.mark} that would bring more carnage to the
country]{.underline}. Millions more refugees might flock out of the
country, overwhelming already taxed nations nearby, and ungoverned
pockets will give terrorist groups new safe havens from which to
operate.

Iran would be on the verge of being a failed state, if it wasn't already
by that point, and the US would be the main reason why. To turn the
tide, America may feel compelled to help rebuild the country at the cost
of billions of dollars, years of effort, and likely more dead. It could
also choose to withdraw, leaving behind a gaping wound in the center of
the Middle East.

In some ways, then, what comes after the war could be worse than the war
itself. It should therefore not be lost on anyone: A US-Iran war would
be a bloody hell during and after the fighting. It's a good thing
neither Trump nor Iran's leadership currently wants a conflict. But if
they change their minds, only carnage follows.

"The worst-case scenarios here are quite serious," Hanna told me.

### Tensions High Now

#### Trump pulled out if the nuclear deal that means that they can proliferate AND withdrawing form the Iran nuclear deal escalates tensions

[and]{.mark} President Donald [Trump is]{.mark} mainly [to
blame]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Exactly one year ago Wednesday, [Trump withdrew]{.mark} the US [from
the]{.mark} [**2015 Iran [nuclear
deal]{.mark}**](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw),
which lifted sanctions from Tehran in exchange for the country agreeing
to curb its nuclear program]{.underline}. That wasn't enough for Trump,
though, who believed the accord was a disaster because it didn't stop
Iran's growing ballistic missile program or sponsorship of terrorism.

The US
president's [**goal**](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/21/17375760/pompeo-iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-strategy-speech),
it seems, is to put so much pressure on Tehran that it has no choice but
to completely change its behavior --- but he could end up leading the
countries to the brink of war in the process.

[[Trump has authorized]{.mark} other hardline moves against Iran since
pulling out of the accord, namely [the [**reimposition of
sanctions**](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18055448/iran-sanctions-trump-pompeo-mnuchin-oil)]{.mark} and
a campaign [to isolate the country]{.mark} from the international
community. [That led Iran]{.mark}'s economy to collapse, plunging the
country [into a deeper and
deeper [**recession**](https://www.ft.com/content/ac599cf4-6a72-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d)]{.mark},
impacting millions of Iranians who were already struggling under
the [**regime's brutal
rule**](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/iran).]{.underline}

Last month[, [the]{.mark} Trump [admin]{.mark}istration took things a
step further when it [decided to label [**the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards
Corps**](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/16/11682458/iran-revolutionary-guards)]{.mark} ---
Iran's hugely influential security and military organization responsible
for the protection and survival of the regime --- [as a [**"foreign
terrorist
organization."**](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm)]{.mark} That's
the first time the US has called any part of another government a
terrorist group, the Trump administration says.]{.underline}

That and other moves put the US and Iran on a collision course --- and
now it seems the countries have finally collided. While Iran has
provoked the international community with its heinous actions, like
supporting Syria's Bashar al-Assad and backing proxy groups that
have [**killed hundreds of US
troops**](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/04/04/iran-killed-more-us-troops-in-iraq-than-previously-known-pentagon-says/),
the fault for today's precarious situation lies mostly at Trump's feet.

"This crisis was both foreseeable and completely avoidable, for those
who wanted to avoid it," Eric Brewer, who worked on Iran in Trump's
National Security Council, told me.

Trump's decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal set the scene for the
worrying events of this week.

Starting on Sunday, the [**Trump administration
indicated**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-national-security-advisor-ambassador-john-bolton-2/?utm_source=twitter) it
had credible intelligence that Iran and groups it supports in the Middle
East might attack US personnel based there. Two days later, reports of
Iran's specific plans surfaced: They apparently intended to [**target US
troops**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/world/middleeast/us-iran-iraq-troops-.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) in
Iraq and Syria, or [**use
drones**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-deployment-triggered-by-intelligence-warning-of-iranian-attack-plans-11557180106) against
Americans in a key waterway near Yemen. However,
some [**reports**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-administration-inflated-iran-intelligence-us-officials-say?via=twitter_page) indicate
that top Trump officials, particularly National Security Adviser John
Bolton, a noted Iran hawk, inflated the threat.

The US has now expedited the aircraft carrier [**USS Abraham
Lincoln**](https://www.axios.com/us-navy-deploys-strike-group-to-iran-bolton-1e5b9298-f807-4db2-a4e7-ddd9f308db36.html)'s
preplanned trip to the Middle East along with multiple [**B-52
bombers**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/05/07/aircraft-carriers-port-visit-is-canceled-pentagon-expedites-its-presence-middle-east-counter-iran/?utm_term=.64b163487aa0),
inching America and Iran ever closer to a fight.

But it gets worse.

In a Wednesday morning speech --- exactly one year after Trump ended the
US commitment to the Iran nuclear deal --- Iranian President Hassan
Rouhani announced two steps that undermine his country's commitment to
the nuclear deal.

First, Iran would start stockpiling extra low-enriched uranium and heavy
water, the kind used in nuclear reactors that [**could be used to
produce a
bomb**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share).
The agreement compels Tehran to export those materials to other
countries.

Second, Rouhani gave the deal's remaining signatories --- mainly
European powers like France, the UK, and Germany --- 60 days to end
US-led financial pressure on Iran's oil and banking sectors or make a
new deal altogether. If not, Tehran will enrich uranium to previously
banned levels, which could bring it closer to gaining a nuclear weapon.

In response, it
appears [**Trump**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/trump-iran-metals?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics&utm_medium=social&utm_content=politics&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic) has
banned trade with Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and copper industries.

So if you're looking for an "off ramp" of sorts right now, you'd be
forgiven for having troubling finding it.

#### No end in sight for US tensions under the trump admin 

Alex **Ward 19**
<https://www.vox.com/2019/5/8/18537160/trump-iran-deal-war-usa>, "Trump
foreign policy making is war more likely", Alex ward is staff writer
covering international security and defense issues, as well as a co-host
of Vox\'s \"Worldly\" podcast.

[Brewer, the Iran expert now at the Center for a New American Security
in Washington, is worried [Washington and Tehran may not be able to
escape this downward spiral.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"None of the theoretical exits from this emerging crisis seem
particularly likely," he told me. "[[Countries]{.mark} and companies
[are not going to be willing to risk US sanctions to provide Iran with
the type and scale of economic benefits it's clearly looking for. Nor is
the US likely to soften its demands.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Gradual escalation seems likely," he continued. And what would that
look like?** **"Iran expanding its nuclear program for coercive
bargaining leverage. Divisions between the US and its allies on the
right approach to Iran. Threats of military action from Israel, and
possible Iranian asymmetric responses in the region." That's a scenario
very similar to what the US faced before the ink on the Iran nuclear
deal was dry.

Now is typically the time when cooler heads prevail, but it's unclear if
there are cooler heads around[. In the US, Bolton and Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo have not made their disdain for Iran a secret,
with [[**Bolton**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/07/are-we-watching-john-boltons-last-stand/) openly
calling for regime change months before joining the
administration.]{.mark}]{.underline} In Iran,
the [**leadership**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal.html) is
under immense pressure to respond to Trump's action. Abandoning some
aspects of the nuclear deal is one way to look both tough and
dismissive.

It's hard to overstate how avoidable this situation was. [[The US and
Iran are closer to war than they have been in years]{.mark} mainly
because of Trump's decision last year. What's more maddening is that
the [**evidence**](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-04/news/iaea-says-iran-abiding-nuclear-deal) shows
that Iran, until now, had abided by the agreement.]{.underline}

But a mixture of Trump's narrow view of the Iran deal and the hawkish
opinions of some of his closest advisers have made the already tense
US-Iran standoff much worse --- and it didn't have to be this way.

"It is the Trump administration's own policy of cornering Tehran that
has greatly magnified the danger," Colin Kahl, an Iran expert and former
adviser to Joe Biden, wrote for [**Foreign
Policy**](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/07/trumps-iran-policy-is-becoming-dangerous/) on
Tuesday. ["[The]{.mark} action-reaction spiral the
[admin]{.mark}istration set in motion with its maximum pressure campaign
[has produced a very ominous situation]{.mark} --- one [in which]{.mark}
the risk of [military confrontation grows]{.mark} by the
day."]{.underline}

WASHINGTON --- [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that
[Iran appeared willing to negotiate over its missile program "for the
first time,"]{.mark} in what he and President Trump presented as
evidence that sanctions and military pressure were working, less than a
month after the president [halted a planned military strike against
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/trump-iran-attack.html?module=inline).]{.underline}

[But within hours of the statement to reporters, delivered before a
cabinet meeting at the White House, the idea was shot down by [Iran's
foreign minister]{.mark}, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was in New York for
a meeting at the United Nations]{.underline}. [His spokesman
[said]{.mark}]{.underline} that the two men had misinterpreted Mr.
Zarif's public statements, in which he repeated past demands [that [if
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates "[wants to talk about missiles, it
should stop selling weapons]{.mark}, including missiles, to regional
states."]{.underline} [It was a clear reference to American weapons
sales [to Saudi Arabia, the U]{.mark}nited [A]{.mark}rab
[E]{.mark}mirates [and Iran's]{.mark} other Arab
[adversaries.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The odd exchange, and the apparent misconstruing of Mr. Zarif's
comments, seemed to underscore the eagerness of the White House to turn
weeks of confrontation with Iran into some kind of negotiating
opportunity --- and a reminder of how hard that will be to accomplish[[.
Iranian officials]{.mark} have repeatedly [said they would engage
with]{.mark} Mr. [Trump]{.mark} [**only** **after he rejoined the 2015
nuclear accord**]{.mark}, which he withdrew from last year.]{.underline}

A spotlight on the people reshaping our politics. A conversation with
voters across the country. And a guiding hand through the endless news
cycle, telling you what you really need to know.Mr. Trump appeared to
ignore that demand, backing up his top diplomat's assessment that
American restrictions on Iranian oil exports had left the regime
"struggling to figure out what they're going to do with their
economy.""They'd like to talk, and we'll see what happens," Mr. Trump
said.But the Iranians say their position is unchanged.

"I think the administration is desperately looking for any sign that
this is working and that Iran is willing to talk," said Philip Gordon, a
Middle East official in the Obama administration who helped to negotiate
the 2015 accord. But Mr. Gordon, now at the Council on Foreign
Relations, added that "[even if both sides overcame the obstacles to
talks, [there's no sign that Iran is]{.mark} remotely [willing to accept
the]{.mark} sort of [deal the administration has said would be its
bottom line]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The exchange between officials of the two countries followed a string of
private messages and efforts at outreach that seemed intended to
de-escalate a series of confrontations that many feared could lead to
war, either accidentally or deliberately.

[[A visit]{.mark} a month ago to [Iran by Japan's prime minister, Shinzo
Abe, went badly,]{.mark} with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, [declaring that he would never speak with]{.mark} Mr.
[Trump]{.mark} and had no intention]{.underline} of repeating the
"bitter experience" of negotiating a hard-fought agreement with the
United States, only to see a new president renounce it. But over the
weekend France sent an emissary to Tehran, seeking a modest short-term
agreement to calm tensions. And Mr. Pompeo, at the last moment, approved
a visa for Mr. Zarif, though the State Department stipulated that he was
being admitted to the United States "for the sole purpose of attending
U.N. meetings" and "should restrict his activities to U.N. business
only," according to a letter obtained by The New York Times. Mohammad

that Iran's missiles "are absolutely and under no condition negotiable
with anyone or any country, period."CreditAtta Kenare/Agence
France-Presse --- Getty Images Then, after Mr. Zarif gave an interview
with Lester Holt of NBC on Sunday, the administration seemed eager to
find any opening. Missiles provided that basis. But Mr. Zarif's
spokesman declared on Tuesday that Iran's missiles "are absolutely and
under no condition negotiable with anyone or any country, period. That
was "not a new position by the Iranians," said Ali Vaez, the Iran
project director of the nonprofit Crisis Group. "They have been saying
this for many, many years now."

[For years [Iran ignored a U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [resolution
tha]{.mark}t effectively [barred it from conducting missile
launches]{.mark}, and [it developed a]{.mark} sophisticated [arsenal**,
capable of reaching**]{.mark} **the edge of [Europe]{.mark}**. Missiles
were not covered in the 2015 nuclear agreement, but the secretary of
state at the time, John Kerry, negotiated language with Mr. Zarif that
watered down the restriction.]{.underline}

The United Nations resolution passed alongside the embrace of the
nuclear accord said that "Iran is called upon not to undertake any
activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of
delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic
missile technology." Iran said that the "called upon" language did not
bar it from such tests, and that none of its missiles were designed to
be nuclear capable. The rebuff to Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo came a day
after European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed that Iran's
recent, carefully calibrated breach of its obligations under the 2015
nuclear deal [were not serious enough to warrant "snapback"
sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/world/europe/iran-eu-nuclear-deal.html?module=inline).
In the European view, it is Mr. Trump who is primarily responsible for
the current standoff.

Nonetheless**, [[Iran has begun to exceed]{.mark} the deal's
[limits]{.mark} [on its stockpile of nuclear material]{.mark} and is
enriching uranium to slightly higher levels of purity than the agreement
sanctioned]{.underline}**. Yet most experts agree that so far the
Iranian actions have not pushed the country over the key measurement:
that it remain at least a year away from enriching enough uranium to
fashion a single nuclear weapon. Mr. Zarif said on Monday that if Iran
wanted nuclear arms, it would have already produced them. In a televised
speech on Sunday, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said that his country
would hold talks with the United States if Washington lifted economic
sanctions and returned to the nuclear deal. But on Tuesday, Mr.
Khamenei, struck a more hostile tone, [railing against the United States
and
Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-khamenei-shipping.html?module=inline) in
a speech on Iranian state television. On his English-language Twitter
account, he said that Iran "will continue the process of cutting down on
its #JCPOA commitments," a reference to the 2015 nuclear deal, which is
officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Mr. Khamenei
was particularly angry over [the impoundment by British forces of an
Iranian
tanker](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/world/middleeast/britain-iran-oil-tanker-syria.html?module=inline) suspected
of transporting oil to Syria in defiance of European sanctions. Mr. Vaez
said France's government was trying to encourage dialogue by proposing
that the United States refrain from imposing new sanctions on Iran and
possibly grant waivers from sanctions against nations that import
Iranian oil. In return, Iran would return to its commitments under the
nuclear deal, refrain from further attacks on oil tankers and
potentially even release American citizens imprisoned in the country.
President Emmanuel Macron of France told reporters on Monday that he
hoped to speak with Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Trump, as well as President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in pursuit of de-escalating tensions. But
Mr. Vaez believes that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo are, for now, engaged in
a form of wishful thinking. "For the administration to jump on this as a
sign of 'maximum pressure' softening the Iranian position and opening up
the door over negotiations over the missile program is at best a sign of
desperation, and at worst a complete misreading of the dynamics in
Iran," Mr. Vaez said.

## ISIS

### ISIS UQ

#### Despite US attacks, the population of ISIS has not decreased and it remains as strong as it was at its peak

**TP 18**, Task and Purpose, military and veteran-focus digital media
company, 8/15/18, "Bad News, ISIS Has Just As Many Fighters in Iraq and
Syria as it Did 4 Years Ago",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/bad-news-isis-has-just-many-fighters-iraq-and-syria-it-did-4-years-ago-28812>

The U.S.-led coalition to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria may have routed
the terror group from its urban strongholds in Mosul and Raqqa, but new
reports from both the [Department of Defense and United Nations reveal
that [tens of thousands of ISIS fighters are **still lurking**]{.mark}
across the war-torn countries]{.underline} --- an army of jihadists on
par with the group's peak strength in 2014.

\- According to Pentagon data released part of an [inspector general
report](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/07/2001951441/-1/-1/1/FY2018_LIG_OCO_OIR3_JUN2018_508.PDF) for
Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Pacific Eagle--Philippines,
ISIS currently has between 15,500 and 17,100 fighters in Iraq and 14,000
fighters in Syria for a total of between 29,500 and 31,100 fighters
under Operation Inherent Resolve's area of responsibility.

\- A report from a United Nations panel of experts circulated to the
media on Monday affirmed the DoD's findings, concluding [that [ISIS 
"has]{.mark} up to [30,000 members]{.mark} roughly equally distributed
between Syria and Iraq and its global network poses a rising
threat]{.underline}," [per](https://apnews.com/b6a68763cd484032820c3a5d7f7a5481?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter) the
Associated Press.

If that 30,000 figure sounds familiar, it should. Back in September
2014, the Central Intelligence
Agency [suggested](https://www.yahoo.com/news/20-000-31-500-fighters-iraq-syria-cia-230059844.html) that
between 20,000 and 31,500 ISIS fighters were roaming between Iraq and
Syria; [[at the **height of its power,** ISIS
fighters [numbered](https://www.voanews.com/a/fears-islamic-state-terror-group-still-potent-in-iraq-syria/4500927.html) ]{.mark}around
[33,000.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\- "[Taken at face value, [the U.S. government is saying ISIS has the
**same number of fighters**]{.mark} in Iraq and Syria today [as when
the]{.mark} \[coalition\] [bombing campaign began]{.mark},"]{.underline}
Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow Thomas
Joscelyn [told](https://www.voanews.com/a/far-from-dead-tens-of-thousands-of-is-fighters-linger-in-iraq-syria/4527452.html) Voice
of America.

\- The UN estimate in particular includes  "a significant component of
the many thousands of active foreign terrorist fighters," per the AP,
noting that despite ISIS's battlefield losses, "a reduced 'covert
version' of the militant group's 'core' will survive in both countries,
with significant affiliated supporters in Afghanistan, Libya, Southeast
Asia and West Africa."

Ironically, U.S. Special Operations Command chief Army Gen. Raymond
Thomas [claimed](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-raymond-thomas-socom-60000-to-70000-isis-fighters-killed-2017-7) last
summer that the U.S. military had killed 60,000 to 70,000 ISIS militants
since the U.S.-led coalition initiated Operation Inherent Resolve in
2014. Taken with the DoD and UN data, perhaps this is a good reminder
[that body counts aren't the best indicator of success on the
battlefield.]{.underline}

#### ISIS has the people and the skill, the only thing they are missing to complete their plans is the weapons

**Williams 18**, Jennifer Williams, Former Senior Researcher for Middle
East Policy at Brookings Institution, deputy foreign policy editor for
Lawfare, 8/17/18, The Pentagon says ISIS is "well-positioned for a
comeback",
<https://www.vox.com/world/2018/8/17/17715374/isis-still-threat-defeated-terror-attacks-pentagon-iraq-syria-trump>

It looks like [[ISIS isn't]{.mark} quite [as defeated as]{.mark}
President Donald [Trump claims]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Yet Trump's own military now says [ISIS is still worryingly
strong.]{.mark}]{.underline}

On Thursday, [a [Pentagon spokesperson
said](https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-well-positioned-to-rebuild-caliphate/4530937.html) that
[the]{.mark} terrorist [group "is well-positioned to rebuild]{.mark} and
work on enabling [its]{.mark} physical [caliphate to
re-emerge.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

"[[ISIS]{.mark} probably [is still more capable than al-Qaida]{.mark} in
Iraq at its peak in 2006-2007]{.underline}, when the group had declared
an Islamic State and operated under the name Islamic State of Iraq,"
Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson [told the news outlet
VOA](https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-well-positioned-to-rebuild-caliphate/4530937.html) in
an emailed statement.

"[[ISIS **remains a threat**]{.mark}, and even one ISIS fighter is one
too many,]{.underline}" he added.

Robertson's comments aren't an anomaly. Everyone from senior Defense
Department officials to the United Nations has been sounding the alarm
lately [that [ISIS is]{.mark} a whole lot [stronger than we'd]{.mark}
previously [thought]{.mark}]{.underline}.

That's not just bad news for Trump --- [**it's bad news for
everyone**.]{.underline}

Multiple reports show [[ISIS's numbers are]{.mark} way [higher
than]{.mark} we [thought]{.mark}]{.underline}

Robertson's comments were in response to a recent report by the [Defense
Department's Inspector
General](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/07/2001951441/-1/-1/1/FY2018_LIG_OCO_OIR3_JUN2018_508.PDF),
which said the [US military estimates that [ISIS still has]{.mark}
between 28,600 and [31,600]{.mark} active [fighters]{.mark} in Syria and
Iraq]{.underline}.

If correct, those numbers are staggering.

Which means that despite the US-led coalition having spent [four years
and \$14.3 billion](https://www.defense.gov/OIR/)fighting ISIS ---
including a whopping 24,566 airstrikes --- [[the group is]{.mark} nearly
[as strong]{.mark} in terms of numbers of fighters [as it was at its
peak]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, as Robertson, the Pentagon spokesperson, [told
VOA](https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-well-positioned-to-rebuild-caliphate/4530937.html),
"Yes, there are still residual numbers of ISIS members. But manpower is
not a good metric to assess the volatility of this terror group."

Just a few years ago, ISIS controlled a swath of territory roughly the
size of Great Britain. It also controlled several major cities in Iraq
and Syria, including Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and Raqqa, the
capital of ISIS's caliphate.

As [my colleague Zack
Beauchamp](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/1/16591458/new-york-attack-isis-islamic-state-strategy) has
written, ["This [territory gave ISIS tremendous resources]{.mark}. It
recruited both volunteers and conscripts, extorted ordinary
citizens,]{.underline} and plundered oil reserves and ancient artifacts
to fill its coffers." He continued:

Perhaps most notably[, [it gave ISIS]{.mark} a powerful veneer of
[legitimacy in the eyes of radicals]{.mark}.]{.underline} The goal of
all jihadist groups, including both ISIS and al-Qaeda, is to establish a
caliphate governed by a strict interpretation of Islamic law. ISIS
claimed to have actually done so. The caliphate became its calling card,
the single best resource for growing its power.

[[ISIS has launched numerous **deadly attacks**]{.mark} in Iraq and
Syria in recent months]{.underline}. As the [Washington
Post ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/isis-is-making-a-comeback-in-iraq-less-than-a-year-after-baghdad-declared-victory/2018/07/17/9aac54a6-892c-11e8-9d59-dccc2c0cabcf_story.html?utm_term=.0f2f1957000f)reported
in July, small-scale attacks in more remote areas of Iraq have
escalated:

Over the past two months, [[dozens of people]{.mark}, including local
government officials, tribal elders and village chiefs, have been
abducted and [killed]{.mark} or ransomed [by fighters]{.mark} claiming
affiliation with the Islamic State]{.underline}. Electricity
infrastructure and oil pipelines have been blown up. Armed men dressed
as security forces and manning fake checkpoints have hijacked trucks and
robbed travelers, rendering the main Baghdad-Kirkuk highway unsafe for a
period of weeks.

[And [it's not just Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In Syria last month, [[ISIS orchestrated a]{.mark} [coordinated [suicide
bombing]{.mark}
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/world/middleeast/isis-bombings-syria.html) [in
Sweida]{.mark} Province]{.underline}, an area in southern Syria close to
the border with Jordan that is primarily home to members of the Druze
minority. [The attacks killed more than 200 people.]{.underline}

So although it may not have its caliphate anymore, [[ISIS is **still a
potent terrorist** organization capable of **wreaking havoc** and
bloodshed.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"[[ISIS will take **full advantage** of any opportunity]{.mark},
including any abatement of pressure, to regain its
momentum]{.underline}," Robertson told VOA.

#### ISIS has popularity they are only missing supplies to attack

HCSS 17, Hauge Center for Strategic Studies, Independent Think Tank, May
12 2017, "The Rise and Fall of ISIS",
<https://hcss.nl/sites/default/files/files/reports/The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20ISIS.pdf>

In spite of the widespread revulsion that the atrocities committed by
ISIS have provoked and the ways it shackles its 'citizens', [[it has
been able to garner]{.mark} significant [public support in]{.mark}
various corners of [the world and found different ways to
**sustain**]{.mark} **the [support]{.mark}** of people living in
ISIS-controlled territory.]{.underline} The principal means by which
ISIS has managed to gain local support is by playing into the fears of
the local Sunni population. In fact, "[many [Sunnis **preferred ISIS
rule**]{.mark} **to accommodation** with the chauvinist Shia
state-building project that]{.underline} (\...) has systematically
excluded Sunnis (\...)."55 Furthermore, it has also benefited from the
unspoken non-aggression pact with the Syrian government army: "The
absence of front lines with the Islamic State gave the regime an excuse
not to fight it (\...). \[This\] lack of fighting also encouraged many
Syrians to move to areas controlled by the Islamic State in the pursuit
of security rather than ideology."56 A similar strategy is applied in
the non-Muslim world. Again, violence is used to sow division. As James
Miller wrote, ["\[[t\]he formula is simple yet]{.mark} **deadly
[effective]{.mark}**[: The more]{.mark} homegrown [jihadists
appear]{.mark}]{.underline} in France, Belgium and the U.K., [the more
[their]{.mark} respective [governments must monitor]{.mark} their
[Muslim communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} And the more they monitor
them[, the more [it fuels resentment among them]{.mark}. And the more
resentment that is fueled, the **[more jihadists are
produced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's the definition of a vicious
circle."57 In other words, ISIS-orchestrated or inspired attacks
polarize Europeans who are driven by fear. This polarization creates
further ground for recruitment.58 Nevertheless, a recent Pew survey
showed that large majorities in countries such as Lebanon (98-100%),
Israel (91-98%) and Palestine (79-92%) reject its divisive tactics

#### ISIS remains the deadliest terrorist group and shows no sign of stopping

1)  **They have killed hundreds only from attacks that they have
    claimed**

2)  **US interference emboldens ISIS, decrease in presence is the only
    way**

**Tracy 17**, Thomas Tracy, Crime Reporter, Daily News Writer, August 21
2017, "ISIS remains deadliest terrorist organization in the world,
report says",
<https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/isis-remains-deadliest-terrorist-organization-world-report-article-1.3429745>

They\'ve taken massive hits in Syria and Iraq, but [the [Islamic State
remains the **deadliest terrorist organization** in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} as its hate-filled tentacles spread across
the globe.

The University of Maryland\'s Global Terrorism Database, which tracks
terror attacks across the world, [determined that [ISIS claimed
responsibility for **more than 7,300 killings**]{.mark} last
year.]{.underline}

In 2016, ISIS \"remained the deadliest terrorist organization in the
world with its \'core\' operatives carrying out more than 1,400
attacks,\" the university said in a report released last week. [\"This
represents a [19% increase in]{.mark} total [attacks and]{.mark} a [39%
increase in]{.mark} total [deaths]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

ISIS claimed responsibility for 931 terror attacks in 2015, which led to
6,050 deaths, according to the U.S. Department of State.

The increase in ISIS-inspired attacks comes even as the number of terror
attacks worldwide dropped by 10% in 2016, the university said.

Anti-terror forces are hacking away at the terror organization\'s roots
in Syria and Iraq[, but the bloodthirsty [jihadists have become
affiliated with]{.mark} a handful of [smaller groups]{.mark}, the study
notes.]{.underline}

The group\'s social media campaigns designed to reach out and inspire
lone [wolf [terrorists have]{.mark} also [expanded its presence]{.mark}
--- [and]{.mark} its [ability to kill]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"During this same time period, [[we]{.mark} (also) [saw an increase in
the number of]{.mark} individual [assailants]{.mark},]{.underline}\"
said Erin Miller, author of the University of Maryland study.

While the violence has been centered primarily in Iraq and Syria, [[ISIS
**spread its terror attacks to new countries**]{.mark} in
2016]{.underline}, including Georgia, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Sweden and
Tanzania, the report found.

More than 950 attacks in which 3,000 people were killed were connected
to terror groups affiliated with ISIS, Miller found.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the van attack Thursday in Barcelona,
Spain, that killed 13 people. The van driver, 22-year-old Younes
Abouyaaqoub, was killed by Spanish police Monday following a three-day
manhunt.

He was killed after shouting \"Allahu akbar\" while wearing a fake
suicide belt in Subirats, a town about 30 miles west of Barcelona,
according to El Pais newspaper.

The Islamic State also took responsibility for inspiring a knife attack
in Siberia on Saturday, in which a man wounded up to eight people.

It was not clear if the group\'s claims are accurate, but experts said
[the Barcelona attack relied on a lone-wolf tactic that the group
encourages.]{.underline}

Since its inception in 2014[, [ISIS has encouraged followers to **strike
its enemies with any weapon available.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the
disbelieving American, Frenchman or any of their allies. Smash his head
with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your
car,\" spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani told the group\'s followers in
2014.

Adnani was killed in a U.S. air strike in Syria last September.

[\"[These calls **increased** as]{.mark} the [U.S]{.mark}.-led coalition
[continued targeting the group]{.mark}, with ISIS media releases and
social media accounts of its fighters regularly calling for attacks in
warring countries,\"]{.underline} said Rita Katz, director of the SITE
Intelligence Group, which monitors militant groups online.

#### ISIS and Al-Queda are resilient and will not stop with force

**WWICS 18**, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Official
Memorial for President Woodrow Wilson, Nation's key Non-Partisan Policy
Forum for Global Issues, Research Center, 9/20/18, "U.S. Report: ISIS
and al-Qaida are resilient",
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/us-report-isis-and-al-qaida-are-resilient>

On September 19, the U.S. State Department reported that "[[the
terrorist landscape grew more complex]{.mark} in 2017.]{.underline}"
Coordinator for Counterterrorism Nathan Sales noted that although
"ninety-nine percent of the territory ISIS once held in Iraq and Syria
has now been liberated[... [ISIS]{.mark}, al-Qaida, and their affiliates
have [proven to be **resilient, determined, and
adaptable**]{.mark}."]{.underline} With the return of foreign fighters
to their home countries and an increase in homegrown terrorists,
ISIS-inspired attacks outside of the warzone persisted. The United
States "increased pressure on al Qaida to prevent its resurgence" with
the expansion of the terrorist designation to an al Qaida affiliate in
Syria and Mali. The following are excerpted remarks by Ambassador Sales
and excerpts from the report on Islamists groups. 

AMBASSADOR SALES:  [[Al-Qaida is a **determined and patient**
adversary]{.mark}.]{.underline}  They have largely remained out of the
headlines in recent years as they've been content to let ISIS bear the
brunt of the international response, but we shouldn't confuse that
period of relative quiet with an -- with al-Qaida's abandonment of its
capabilities or intentions to strike us and our allies.  That is why we
are continuing to keep the pressure on al-Qaida, its affiliates, and its
individuals.  The report details a number of efforts that we've taken to
designate -- and I mentioned in my opening remarks -- efforts that we
have taken to designate al-Qaida affiliates in Syria, in Mali, as well
as individuals who are associated with the group.

So although ISIS has gotten the headlines, we remain focused and
determined to confront al-Qaida wherever we find it.

AMBASSADOR SALES:  [Well, I think all three of the major [terrorist
adversaries]{.mark} that I've highlighted [have]{.mark} both the
capability and **[intent to strike the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**
and our allies]{.underline}.  Al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has
repeatedly called for AQ members and followers to commit attacks here in
the U.S.  [[ISIS]{.mark}-inspired [attacks have occurred]{.mark} here
[in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, including in New York City last
October]{.underline}.  And as far as Iran-backed terrorist organizations
are concerned, we've arrested a number of operatives who allegedly were
casing targets in support of Iran-backed terrorist organizations and
they're now facing charges in federal court. 

So I think all three of them have both the capability and intent, and so
the key question then becomes:  What are we doing about it?  And I think
there's a suite of tools that are useful against all three of those
diverse threat streams.  [**[You've got to stop the flow of
money]{.mark}** to these organizations. ]{.underline} That's why we
designate individuals and facilitators and financiers. [ You've got [to
be able to stop terrorist travel]{.mark}.]{.underline}  That's why we're
doing things like collecting biometrics at the border, sharing
information about known and suspected terrorists, analyzing airline
reservation data to identify previously unknown threats.  And another
thing you've got to do is use law enforcement tools to prosecute and
investigate and, when convicted, to incarcerate suspected terrorists.

Overview: By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), with the
support of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, had reclaimed
all of the territory that ISIS had captured in 2014 and 2015[. As
[ISIS]{.mark} retreated from Mosul and other cities, its [fighters used
improvised explosive devices]{.mark}, homemade mines, and mortars to
booby-trap homes, public spaces, and critical infrastructure to impede
the movement of Iraq's security forces and terrorize returning
residents. Despite Iraqi progress on the battlefield, **[ISIS maintained
the capability to conduct deadly terrorist
attacks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist
Organization Kata'ib Hizballah continued to operate in Iraq during 2017,
exacerbating sectarian tensions. Along with its nefarious activities,
Kata'ib Hizballah continued to combat ISIS alongside the Iraqi military,
police, and other Popular Mobilization Force units during the year. Iraq
expanded its cooperation with the United States and other members of the
international community to counter terrorism, including taking steps to
dismantle ISIS's financial activity. Iraq passed 31 resolutions aimed at
stopping terrorist financing and made significant progress implementing
its 2016 Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Terrorism Finance law,
including establishing a committee that designated at least 30
individuals in 2017.

#### Reports on ISIS being eliminated are incorrect, ISIS is alive and strong waiting for the right moment

**Ellyatt 17**, Holly Ellyatt, Correspondent for CNBC.com, Worked in
production, European Political and Political Studies at University
College London, 11/23/17, "The end of ISIS? Experts warn the terror
group is still a 'serious global threat'",
<https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/23/isis-finished-experts-warn-the-terror-group-is-still-a-serious-global-threat.html>

[The so-called [Islamic State]{.mark}]{.underline} is largely made up of
Sunni militants from Iraq and Syria but [[has drawn jihadi fighters from
**across the Muslim world and Europe.**]{.underline}]{.mark} There is
increasingly positive noise that the group, which has controlled swathes
of Iraq and Syria amid governmental and regional instability, is soon to
be defeated.

[[Syrian and Iraqi government]{.mark} forces and disparate rebel groups,
particularly in Syria, have fought to reclaim territories **[lost to
ISIS]{.mark} over the last few years** as it attempted to spread a
caliphate]{.underline} -- a state governed by a strict interpretation of
Islam.

The tide has turned more strongly against ISIS this year, however, with
the group losing Raqqa (in Syria), Mosul (in Iraq) and numerous other
strongholds to such an extent that .

He thanked those who had fought against ISIS in Syria and Iraq for
helping to "put an end to a group that did not bring anything for us but
evil, misery, destruction, murder and savagery."

In addition, on Thursday[, Iraqi forces launched an operation to clear
the desert bordering Syria of Islamic State militants, calling it a
final campaign to clear the group from Iraqi territory]{.underline}.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was cautious earlier this week,
saying he'd only declare that ISIS had been defeated once its militants
were dispelled from the desert.

Shiraz Maher, deputy director of The International Centre for the Study
of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) at King's College
London, had a similar view.

"[[**I don't think we're anywhere near looking at an after-Daesh
reality.** Daesh is here,]{.mark} it's very much [remaining as a
player]{.mark} on the ground,]{.underline}" he told the RUSI conference.

"It is now reverting to type -- this was a group that emerged from being
insurgency to a protest state and it's now pulling back to what it knows
best. [[It will]{.mark} slip back into the deserts **ready to regroup,
to [return and to fight another day]{.mark}**," he said.]{.underline}

Despite the complexities and mixed motives, a combined push against
Islamic State has made the pseudo-state crumble, according to the
statistics.

IHS Markit's specialist research unit, Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency
Centre (JTIC), released a report Wednesday underlining the "extent of
the degradation of the Islamic State's armed campaign in the country
(Iraq)" with the number of attacks and resultant fatalities hitting the
lowest level since ISIS declared a caliphate in 2014.

"While this process (of decreasing attacks and fatalities) has been
ongoing since June 2016, the pace of operational decline has increased
over the previous 12 months; the 126 attacks in October represented
almost half the peak recorded in January, while the 102 fatalities
represented an 80.0 percent decrease from November 2016," JTIC's head
Matt Henman said in the report.

Still, JTIC's data showed [that [Islamic State **was still
deadly**]{.mark}, with the steady territorial [degradation of
the]{.mark} self-proclaimed [caliphate]{.mark} increasingly [leading the
group to revert to]{.mark} what JTIC called "asymmetric operations,
typified by low-level [attacks targeting]{.mark} the [security forces
and]{.mark} **higher profile attacks [against civilian sectarian
targets]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

For instance, in September the Islamic State conducted 22 suicide
attacks, resulting in 93 fatalities. This dropped to 15 attacks and
seven fatalities in October. Notably, 80 percent of those 15 attacks
were either disrupted by the security forces prior to detonation or
resulted in no fatalities beyond the attackers -- an increase from 72.7
percent in September, JTIC said.

### AS k2 ISIS

#### US Weapons to Iraq seized by ISIS

Brian **Castner 17**, Explosive Ordnance Disposal officer who received a
Bronze Star for his service in the Iraq War, author of two books,
12/12/17 "Exclusive: tracing ISIS' wepaons suplly chain -- back to the
US", Wired,
<https://www.wired.com/story/terror-industrial-complex-isis-munitions-supply-chain/>

[Many of [ISIS' leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} were veterans of that
insurgency, but as they began ramping up their war against the Iraqi
government in 2014, [they [knew they needed]{.mark} more than [IEDs and
AK-47s to seize territory]{.mark} and create their independent Islamic
State. [A conventional war required conventional arms]{.mark}---mortars,
rockets, grenades---which, as an international pariah, ISIS could not
buy in sufficient quantities]{.underline}. [Some [they **looted from the
Iraqi**]{.mark} or Syrian **[government]{.mark}s**]{.underline}, but
when those ran out they did something that no terrorist group has ever
done before and that they continue to do today: design their own
munitions and mass-produce them using advanced manufacturing techniques.
Iraq's oil fields provided the industrial base---tool-and-die sets,
high-end saws, injection-­molding machines---and skilled workers who knew
how to quickly fashion intricate parts to spec. Raw materials came from
cannibalizing steel pipe and melting down scrap. ISIS engineers forged
new fuzes, new rockets and launchers, and new bomblets to be dropped by
drones, all assembled using instruction plans drawn up by ISIS
officials.

Since the early days of the conflict, CAR has conducted 83 site visits
in Iraq to collect weapons data, and Spleeters has participated in
nearly every investigation. The result is a detailed database that lists
1,832 weapons and 40,984 pieces of ammunition recovered in Iraq and
Syria. CAR describes it as "the most comprehensive ­sample of Islamic
State--captured weapons and ammunition to date."

Which is how, this autumn, Spleeters came to be hovering over a 5-gallon
bucket of aluminum paste in a dingy home in Tal Afar, waiting for his
fixer to arrive. Al-Hakim is bald, well-dressed, and gives off a faint
air of the urban sophisticate, such that at times he looks a bit out of
place in a sewage-filled ISIS workshop. The two men have an easy
rapport, though one in which al-Hakim is the host and Spleeters always
the respectful guest. Their job is to notice small things; where others
might see trash, they see evidence, which Spleeters then photographs and
scours for obscure factory codes that can give a clue to its origins.

The aluminum paste in the bucket, for example, which ISIS craftsmen mix
with ammonium nitrate to make a potent main charge for mortars and
rocket warheads: Spleeters discovered the same buckets, from the same
manufacturers and chemical distributors, in Fallujah, Tikrit, and Mosul.
"I like to see the same stuff" in different cities, he tells me, since
these repeat sightings allow him to identify and describe different
steps in ISIS' supply chain. "It confirms my theory that this is the
industrial revolution of terrorism," he says. "And for that they need
raw material in industrial quantities."

Spleeters is also constantly searching for new weapons that show how
ISIS engineers' expertise is evolving, and with this trip to Tal Afar he
has set his sights on one promising new lead: a series of modified
rockets that had appeared in ISIS propaganda videos on YouTube and other
social media.

Spleeters suspected that the tubes, trigger mechanisms, and fins of the
new rockets were all the work of ISIS engineers, but he thought the
warheads likely came from somewhere else. After discovering similar
weapons over the past six months, he has grown to believe [that [**ISIS
may have captured the warheads** **from anti­government
militias**]{.mark} in the Syrian civil war that had been [secretly
**armed b**]{.mark}**y** Saudi Arabia and **[the U]{.mark}**nited
[**S**t]{.mark}ates]{.underline}.

But he needs more evidence to prove it. If he can find more launchers
and more warheads, Spleeters believes he can build up enough proof---for
the first time---[that [ISIS is repurposing powerful explosive
ordnance]{.mark}, [purchased by the US]{.mark}, [for use in urban combat
against the Iraqi army]{.mark} and its American special operations
partners]{.underline}. For ISIS to produce such sophisticated weapons
marks a significant escalation of its ambition and ability. It also
provides a disturbing glimpse of the future of warfare, where dark-web
file sharing and 3-D printing mean that any group, anywhere, could start
a homegrown arms industry of its own.

#### US arms to Syria end up in the hands of ISIS

Bethan **McKernan 17** , Turkey and Middle East correspondent for the
Guardian, "US and Saudi Arabia significantly enhanced ISIS' military
capabilities, report reveals"
<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-us-saudi-arabia-arms-fighters-jihadis-military-capability-enhanced-weapons-syria-terrorism-a8112076.html>

An extensive field investigation into the origins of
[Isis](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/isis)' weaponry in
[Syria](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/syria) and
[Iraq](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/iraq) has found [that
[**weapon**s supplied by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[US]{.mark}** and
Saudi Arabia [to the Syrian opposition]{.mark} often [ended up in the
**jihadis' hands**]{.mark}, [enhancing]{.mark} the "quantity and
quality" of [their armaments]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [[most weapons
in Isis' arsenal]{.mark} were [captured from]{.mark} the [Syrian and
Iraqi armies]{.mark}]{.underline}, Conflict Armament Research (CAR)'s
report, published on Thursday, found that the number of US and Saudi
supplied weapons in Isis' arsenal goes "far beyond those that would have
been available through battle capture alone". ["Iraq and Syria have seen
[Isis forces use]{.mark} large numbers of [weapons, supplied b]{.mark}y
states such as Saudi Arabia and the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,
against the various international anti-Isis coalitions that the two
states support]{.underline}," researchers found. "Evidence collected by
CAR indicates that the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has repeatedly
[diverted]{.mark} EU-manufactured [weapons]{.mark} and ammunition [to
opposition forces in the Syrian conflict]{.mark}. [Isis forces]{.mark}
rapidly [gained custody of **significant quantities**]{.mark} of this
material]{.underline}," it said. "\[The findings are\] a stark reminder
of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts
in which multiple competing and overlapping non-state armed groups
operate." The analysis of more than 40,000 items found that in total,
however, about 90 per cent of the weapons and ammunition overall were
made in Russia, China and Eastern Europe. Three per cent of Isis'
arsenal was Nato-grade. The report also found that over the last three
years had been able to produce its own military-grade weapons and
standardise production across the so-called caliphate.

#### Blowback from US arms sales to Iraq through ISIS

Daniel R**. DePetris 18**, fellow at Defense Priorities, and a columnist
for the Washington Examiner and the American Conservative 11/19/18 "Time
to Rethink America's vast arms deals"
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/time-rethink-americas-vast-arms-deals-36522>

It's a stunning rebuke from Washington's European allies, but a
nevertheless understandable one given the [vast quantities of [American
military equipment]{.mark} that have been **[seized by terrorist
organizations]{.mark}** [on the battlefields of Iraq and
Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [[the Islamic State has been a
prime benefactor]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a loose [U.S. arms export]{.mark}
policy]{.underline}, one that is more reflexive---and based on
short-term considerations---than strategic. Who can forget the iconic
image of the black-clad, long-bearded Islamic State fighter doing
doughnuts in a U.S.-manufactured humvee? Or pictures of ISIS militants
posing in front of U.S.-made personnel carrier looted from the Iraqi
army?

[ISIS has gotten its hands on so much U.S. weaponry that Washington has
been forced to bomb its own equipment to mitigate the
damage]{.underline}. Former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
[estimated [the loss of 2,300
humvees](https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/01/isis-captured-2300-humvee-armoured-vehicles-from-iraqi-forces-in-mosul) from
Iraqi government stocks during ISIS's 2014 blitz into
Mosul]{.underline}. When Iraqi forces conducted a hasty retreat from
Ramadi in 2015, ISIS overran army warehouses and bases, claiming what a
Pentagon spokesman at the time said was one hundred heavy vehicles and
"[maybe a half-dozen
tanks](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/05/20/isis-captures-hundreds-of-us-vehicles-and-tanks-in-ramadi-from-i.html)[."
The terrorist organization
even [converted](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/04/hell-on-wheels/) "Made
in the USA" humvees into nearly impenetrable suicide car
bombs]{.underline}, a formidable foe to an Iraqi army suffering from
demoralization, poor leadership and exhaustion.

[In Syria, [American arms destined for moderate opposition
factions]{.mark} were [forcibly seized by the very terrorist
groups]{.mark} the weapons were meant to combat]{.underline}. A 2017
report from Conflict Armament Research found multiple instances of
[U.S.-purchased weapons from the Balkans being stolen, sold, or siphoned
off to more radical groups]{.underline}. Anti-tank weapons made in
Europe, sold to America, and transferred to Syrian opposition forces
were later discovered in the custody of ISIS. According to [the
report](http://www.conflictarm.com/download-file/?report_id=2568&file_id=2574),
"Supplies of materiel into the Syrian conflict from foreign
parties---notably [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and Saudi
Arabia---[have indirectly allowed IS to obtain substantial quantities of
anti-armour ammunition]{.mark}]{.underline}. These weapons include ATGWs
and several varieties of rocket with tandem warheads, which are designed
to defeat modern reactive armour."

The Europeans have had their own problems on this score. Balkan nations
like Bulgaria, Croatia, and Montenegro---which previously sold
Soviet-era small arms and ammunition to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and
Turkey---saw these same weapons [being
diverted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/weapons-flowing-eastern-europe-middle-east-revealed-arms-trade-syria) into
Syria and Yemen. In some cases, the arms would be wind up in the
possession of Islamic extremist groups.

Recent history gives credence to the EU Parliament's concern on the
increasingly influential arms industry. [[Blowback]{.mark}, whereby arms
delivered to proxies can be acquired by adversarial groups and used
against you, [is a legitimate issue]{.mark} confirmed by the extensive
field work of UN investigators and non-governmental arms
researchers.]{.underline} End-user agreements, which require the buyer
to seek permission from the supplier before selling the weapons to a
third-party, are violated repeatedly and with hardly any consequence.

But EU politicians should get their own house in order before pointing
the finger at the United States. As much as the EU may like to preach
from a pedestal and lecture Washington about the moral hazards of
defense sales, EU members are also to blame for the mountain of small
arms in the Arab world's war zones and arms bazaars.

#### ISIS gets weapons through proliferation\-\-- poor regulation and irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq and Syria arming terrorists 

**ATA 17-** Atlantic Treaty Association (ATA) since 1954 has been
conducting analyses, education, and information activities on foreign
affairs and security issues relevant to the Atlantic Alliance. March 28,
2017, "Analyzing the Islamic State's Weapons Capability: What Weapons
Does It Use and Where Does It Get Them",
http://www.atahq.org/ata-policy-focus/analyzing-the-islamic-states-weapons-capability-what-weapons-does-it-use-and-where-does-it-get-them/

The Islamic State has been severely weakened in recent months due to
advances made by Iraqi forces, Shi'ite militias, Kurdish fighters, and
the US-led coalition. Through gruelling battles over its strongholds,
[[ISIS has not only suffered the loss of land and personnel]{.mark}, but
it has also lost access to key sources of revenue and has simultaneously
seen its online presence diminish]{.underline}. [[Still,]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[group's advanced weapons capability makes it a
constant threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to those who do not subscribe to
its apocalyptic worldview. In order to neutralize the military threat
posed by ISIS, it is first necessary to investigate its weapons
capability and the sources of its weaponry.

Since its rebranding in 2013 and its campaigns [to control major cities
in Iraq and Syria the following year, [ISIS has acquired a diversified
arsenal of weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [**group acquired these
weapons [by defeating US-armed Iraqi and Kurdish forces]{.mark}**[,
stealing]{.mark} chemical weapons from dictators' stockpiles in the
region, [trafficking]{.mark} materiel into ISIS-controlled territory,
[and developing its own]{.mark} weapons production
factories]{.underline}. These methods of acquiring weapons allowed ISIS
not only to use arms similar to those used by other terrorist groups,
but also to manufacture military grade munitions that rival those of
nation-states.

Like many other non-state armed groups before it, [ISIS has a preference
for assault rifles,]{.underline} and its militants' preferred weapon has
been the AK-47. During its early periods of operation, the group used
concealable and transportable weapons, such as shoulder-fired missiles,
likely because its members were conducting stealth operations to gain
control of territory in a relatively short period of time. ISIS seized
most of Anbar Province in January 2014 and proceeded to seize control of
Mosul, forcing government troops to abandon the city. As [the [group
continued to expand]{.mark} its territory [in northern and western Iraq
as well as]{.mark} in [Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[it]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[gained control of]{.mark} the
[weapons]{.mark} and military vehicles [left]{.mark} [behind by Iraqi
and Syrian forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** and rebels. Among these were:
approximately 55 Soviet-era tanks, six Soviet BRDM-2 amphibious armoured
vehicles, two Soviet MT-LB amphibious auxiliary armoured vehicles, 20
Soviet BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, three Soviet 2S1 Gvozdika
self-propelled artillery, a fleet of US-built Humvees, B-10 and M40
recoilless rifles, RPG-7s, and a variety of multiple-rocket launchers,
howitzers, field guns, anti-aircraft guns, man-portable air-defense
systems, antitank missiles, and even Blackhawk helicopters and fighter
jets.

ISIS also established complex trafficking routes that allow illicit arms
and ammunition to enter the country. [The group purchased weapons from
military personnel, gunrunners and other militant groups in Turkey,
Qatar, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan]{.underline}, all
of whom help the group bring the weapons into the country undetected.
Turkey serves as a key international transit point, and reports indicate
that weapons from Croatia have entered ISIS-controlled territory through
its Turkish border. ISIS' black market activity, however, has primarily
focused on ammunition. An investigation conducted by the UK-based
Conflict Armament Research organization determined that [**[ISIS
uses]{.mark} [ammunition]{.mark}** [originating from 21
countries]{.mark}, [**of which most were manufactured in**
China,]{.mark} the Soviet Union/[Russia]{.mark}n Federation, [and **the
US**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ammunition from Serbia, Sudan, North Korea,
Hungary, and Kyrgyzstan has also been found in ISIS territory,
indicating that the group's network structure and transnational
trafficking channels allow it to receive arms and supplies from a
variety of global sources. Furthermore, Iranian-manufactured ammunition
was found in ISIS' weapons caches, potentially violating a 2006 United
Nations Security Council Resolution prohibiting Iran from exporting
ammunition.

[ISIS' weapons capability surpasses that of other jihadist terrorist
groups not only because of its seizure of military grade weapons, but
also its adeptness in manufacturing]{.underline} its own armaments. In
November 2016, investigation teams in recently liberated areas of Mosul
uncovered six ISIS factories in which rockets, shells, and mortars were
manufactured. According to the team's report, "The degree of
organization, quality control, and inventory management indicates a
complex, centrally controlled industrial production system." The
standardized practices adopted by the group resemble those of
conventional militaries and have allowed it to produce tens of thousands
of rockets and mortars, demonstrating that the Islamic State's weapons
production capacity may indeed be similar to that of a nation-state.

With multiple sources of weapons and ammunition, one may ask what can be
done to degrade ISIS' weapons capability. Firstly, Iraqi, Shi'ite,
Kurdish, and allied forces must continue the push to regain territory in
Iraq and Syria, as ISIS militants will be forced to leave weapons
manufacturing plants and larger weapons behind. Secondly, Syria's
borders with Iraq and neighbouring countries must be fortified. The
border between Turkey and Syria is of particular importance, as weapons
and chemical warfare agents have been smuggled into Syria through its
northern border. States around the world must also enhance oversight
mechanisms to ensure that gunrunners and rogue military personnel are
not exporting weapons and ammunition.

[[Amnesty International has attributed ISIS' vast arsenal]{.mark} of
weapons **[to poor regulation and a lack of oversight of arms
imports]{.mark}, [irresponsible arms transfers,]{.mark} and lax controls
over military stockpiles**]{.underline}. In light of these points,
[coalition forces must be careful in selecting which militias they
arm]{.underline} in the fight against ISIS [and the extent to which they
are arming them.]{.underline} Mechanisms must be put in place to keep
the Iraqi military armed and in control of weapons stockpiles, while
non-state groups are disarmed. However, [[disarming ISIS, as well as
Iraq and Syria]{.mark} in general, [is no easy order**; with increased
regional insecurity, the problem of weapons proliferation in Iraq and
Syria will likely get worse**]{.mark}]{.underline} before it gets
better.

#### Proliferation of small arms increase the use of child soldiers\-\-- modern weapons designed to be lighter and easier to use 

Scott **Gates &** Simon **Reich 10-** Scott Gates PhD, Political
Science, Director, CSCW, PRIO, August 2002-2012. Simon Reich professor
of political science and a member of the Division of Global Affairs
faculty at Rutgers University, "[Child Soldiers in the Age of Fractured
States"]{.underline} (pg 100) University of Pittsburgh Press, 2010

[[Concurrent with]{.mark} this trend of [socioeconomic
disconnection]{.mark} [has been]{.mark} the [proliferation and
technological advancement of]{.mark} personal
[weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline}. This development.is a key enabler,
without which the earlier trend would not matter. Technological changes
are what [allow this broadened pool of potential recruits to be turned
into able soldiers.]{.underline}

When thinking about military operations[, we typically focus on the most
complex and expensive weapons systems]{.underline}, such as missiles,
tanks, and aircraft carriers. [[For most conflicts]{.mark} around the
globe, however]{.underline}, this picture is inaccurate Instead, the
[[weapons that shape contemporary warfare]{.mark} the most [are the ones
that are the simplest and least costly]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These [["small arms" or "light weapons"]{.mark} include rifles,
grenades, light machine guns, light mortars, land mines, and other
weapons]{.underline} that are "man portable" (a term often used by the
military). Even though they represent less than 2 percent of the entire
global arms trade in terms of cost, [small arms are perhaps the most
deadly of all weapons to society]{.underline} (Salopek 2002; Smith and
Stohl 1999). [They [are]{.mark} the weapons [most often used in battle
and in attacks on civilians and]{.mark} have [produced almost 90 percent
of all]{.mark} [causalities in recent wars]{.mark}]{.underline} (Klare
1999). In just West Africa alone more than 2 million people were killed
by small arms in the last decade (Neild 2000). Indeed, modern small arms
can rend the fabric of civil society like no other weapons; **[[with
them, a small, relatively weak group can easily turn a peaceful country
into a]{.mark} man-made [humanitarian disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Technology and efficiency advances in **[[theses weapons]{.mark} now
[permit the transformation of children into
fighters]{.mark}]{.underline}** just as lethal as any adult. For the
most of human history, weapon relied on the brute strength of the
operator They also typically required years of training to master. This
was obviously prohibitive to the use of children as soldiers. A child
who was not physically mature could not bear the physical burdens of
serving in the phalanx of the anciet Greek hoplites or carrying the
weight of medieval knight's armor, let alone serve as an effective
combatant. Even until just a few generations ago, personal battlefield
weapons such as the bolt action rifles of the World War II were still
heavy and bulky, limiting children's participation (Center for Defense
Information 1997).

However[, [there have been many recent improvements]{.mark} in
manufacturing, such as the incorporation of plastics.]{.underline}
**[This [means]{.mark} that [all modern weapons,]{.mark} particularly
automatic rifles, [are so light that small children can use them as
easily]{.mark}]{.underline}** and effectively as adults. They are no
longer just man-portable but are child-portable as well. Just as
important, [[most]{.mark} of these weapons [have been simplified in
their use]{.mark}, [to the extent]{.mark} that [they can be]{.mark}
stripped, reassembles, and [fired by a child younger than
ten]{.mark}.]{.underline} The ubiquitous Russian- designed Kalash-nikov
AK-47, which weighs ten and a half pounds, is a prime example. Having
only nine moving parts, it is brutally simple. Interviews reveal that it
generally takes children around 30min to learn their use. The weapon is
also designed to be exceptionally hardy. It requires little maintenance
and can even be buried in dirt for storage (something guerilla groups
often do as a sort of insurance policy, in case a cease- fire breaks
down).

#### ISIS has possession of US weapons -- serial numbers were traced back

**Joselow 17** Gabe Joselow, Multimedia producer for NBC News, former
East Africa Bureau Chief for Voice of America, 12/04/17, "ISIS weapons
arsenal included some purchased by US government",
[[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-weapons-arsenal-included-some-purchased-u-s-government-n829201]{.underline}](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-weapons-arsenal-included-some-purchased-u-s-government-n829201)

[Some [weapons bought by the U.S. military]{.mark} in 2015 [ended up
in]{.mark} the hands of [Islamic State fighters **within two
months**]{.mark}, according to a report released Thursday.]{.underline}

The findings, by [Conflict Armament
Research](http://www.conflictarm.com/) (CAR), an independent
arms-tracking organization, [are [based on]{.mark} three years of
meticulous documentation of weapons recovered from ISIS on the
battlefields of Iraq and Syria.]{.underline}

[[CAR used]{.mark} [serial numbers]{.mark} or key markings on the
weapons [to trace them]{.mark} back to their origin and try to piece
together how they were obtained by the militants.]{.underline}

Some of the weapons found on the front lines after ISIS was driven out
also include Chinese-manufactured machine guns laced with amphetamines,
drones modified in sophisticated terrorist factories and even a rifle
made in Nazi Germany.

CAR found that one anti-tank missile sold to the U.S. Army made its way
to ISIS in just 59 days.

["[This is **extremely short**]{.mark}," said Damien
Spleeters,]{.underline} the group\'s researcher for Iraq and Syria, told
NBC News during a recent field visit to Tal Afar, Iraq. "It means that
there are not many intermediaries in this chain of custody."

Under at least two different programs, the U.S. government has supplied
weapons to Syrian armed groups, first to fight the Assad regime and then
to assist the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the fight against the
Islamic State. Some of ISIS' weapons are also thought to have been
pilfered from military stockpiles while others were purchased illicitly.

According to CAR\'s report, Iraqi police recovered a Bulgarian-made
missile tube --- part of a system for firing a wire-guided anti-tank
missile --- during the battle of Ramadi on Feb. 9, 2016.

CAR documented the item and traced its origin to a Bulgarian
manufacturer. The company confirmed to researchers that the weapon had
been exported to the U.S. Army through an arms broker on Dec. 12, 2015.

It is not entirely clear how the weapon got from the Bulgarian plant to
ISIS fighters in Iraq.

However, a Syrian opposition group called Jaysh al-Nasr posted a series
of photographs on Dec. 21, 2016, showing fighters posing in a snowy
landscape. A closer inspection shows that one of their anti-tank weapons
bears an identical lot number and a similar serial number to the item
seized in Iraq.

That suggests, the report says, that they \"were part of the same supply
chain.\"

CAR says the United States has not yet replied to a trace request for
the weapon.

Kiesler Police Supply Co., which CAR says brokered the anti-tank
missile\'s sale to the U.S. military, declined to comment.

[[Based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the anti-tank missile tube found in
Ramadi [and other examples of [weapons purchased by U.S.
suppliers]{.mark} from European manufacturers, CAR says [there is
evidence that]{.mark} many [weapons obtained by]{.mark} various Syrian
[rebel groups supported by the U.S. were **diverted to
ISIS**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When asked to comment on U.S.-purchased arms potentially ending up in
the hands of ISIS, Eric Pahon, a spokesman for the Department of
Defense, said, "Any alleged misuse or diversion of U.S. support will be
taken seriously and lead to the possible curtailment of support, if
verified."

Pahon added that he had not seen the CAR report.

The CIA ran a covert program for arming some rebel groups fighting
Syrian regime forces until the [Trump administration reportedly axed it
in
July](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/did-trump-just-declassify-secret-cia-program-tweet-n786381).
U.S. government and military officials have declined to ever confirm the
existence of the CIA program on the record, though President Donald
Trump tweeted about it this year.

Charles Lister, who specializes in Syrian rebel groups as a senior
fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington think tank, said Jaysh
al Nasr was \"one of the most significant groups\" receiving support
under the program.

#### The US sent weapons to Iraqi government -- It ended up providing ISIS with a lethal range of weapons

**[Irresponsible [arms transfers by]{.mark} countries including the UK,
[USA]{.mark}, Russia, China, Germany and France have [provided]{.mark}
the [armed group with a]{.mark} huge and [lethal
arsenal]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

For years, weapons of war have been freely flowing into Iraq. [[**Slack
controls** over Iraqi military stockpiles]{.mark} and endemic corruption
[by]{.mark} successive [Iraqi governments]{.mark} have [added to the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

When Islamic State (IS) took control of these areas, these weapons were
theirs for the taking[. [These weapons]{.mark}, manufactured at least 25
countries, [are]{.mark} now [in the hands of ISIS and being used to
commit]{.mark} **horrific [abuses]{.mark}**, killings, rape, torture and
abduction]{.underline} -- and forced thousands to flee their homes.

'Decades of free-flowing arms into Iraq meant that when IS took control
of these areas, they were like children in a sweetshop.

'[The fact that [countries]{.mark} including the UK have [ended up
**inadvertently** arming IS, should give us pause over]{.mark} current
[weapons deals.]{.mark}']{.underline}

Oliver Sprague, Arms Programme Director at Amnesty 

Most of the arms date from the 1970s up to the 1990s, including pistols,
handguns and other small arms, machine guns, anti-tank weapons, mortars
and artillery. 

[We've found [ISIS use of arms]{.mark} and ammunition from at least 25
different countries -- a large proportion [were originally sourced by
the Iraqi military **from the USA,**]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia and
former Soviet bloc states.

The huge scope reflects decades of irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq,
coupled with the failure to install oversight mechanisms during the
US-led occupation after 2003.

Slack controls over military stockpiles and endemic corruption by
successive Iraqi governments have added to the problem.

Among ISIS's arsenal are portable air defence systems, guided anti-tank
missiles and armoured fighting vehicles, as well as assault rifles like
the Russian AK series and the US M16 and Bushmaster.

The Iraqi army's weapon supplies grew in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
especially around the Iran-Iraq war.

This was a seminal moment in the development of the modern global arms
market.

At least 34 different countries supplied Iraq with weapons -- 28 of
those states were also supplying arms to Iran.

Meanwhile Iraq's then-President Saddam Hussein oversaw the development
of a strong national arms industry producing small arms, mortar and
artillery shells.

[[The US-led invasion]{.mark} of Iraq in 2003 [meant the country was
**flooded with**]{.mark} **more [weapon imports]{.mark}** once again --
but [most were never secured]{.mark} or audited [by]{.mark} the
[coalition forces]{.mark} [or]{.mark} the re-formed [Iraqi
army]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hundreds of thousands of those weapons went
missing and are still unaccounted for.

#### ISIS has stolen US-supplied weapons from Syria

**Horton 17**, Alex Horton, General Assignment Reporter covering
national and breaking news, Served in Iraq as Army Infantryman, BA in
English from Georgetown University, Writer for the Washington Post,
12/14/17, "ISIS stole US-supplied rockets weeks after they arrived in
Syria, report says",
[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/12/14/how-u-s-weapons-helped-isis-fuel-the-industrial-revolution-of-terrorism/?utm_term=.22346a3cf47a]{.underline}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/12/14/how-u-s-weapons-helped-isis-fuel-the-industrial-revolution-of-terrorism/?utm_term=.22346a3cf47a)

The Islamic State may stand alone in its brutality in Iraq and Syria,
where it orchestrated civilian massacres and suicide bombings and salted
people's homes with thousands of improvised explosives. But a new
report, three years in the making, describes the group as shrewd
manufacturing and logistical planners who moved weapons, munitions and
bombmaking materials throughout the war zone on a scale unprecedented
for a terror organization.

[Conflict Armament Research ([CAR]{.mark}), a [weapons-tracking group
based in Britain](http://www.conflictarm.com/), [documented]{.mark} more
than 40,000 firearms and [munitions across Iraq and Syria]{.mark} by
dispatching field investigators]{.underline} in an arc stretching from
the northern Syrian city of Kobane to south of Baghdad, Iraq's capital
--- a rough tracing of the Islamic State's path to conquer wide swaths
of territory and establish its caliphate.

The [report](http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/), which the
researchers call the most comprehensive to date about how the Islamic
State obtained and fielded its weapons, was published Thursday and could
become a vital tool for understanding the terror group's deadly
industrial proficiency. Here are a few takeaways:

**[The [Islamic State used rockets supplied by the United States]{.mark}
--- possibly [in violation of agreements with weapons
makers]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As The Washington Post [reported in
July](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-ends-covert-cia-program-to-arm-anti-assad-rebels-in-syria-a-move-sought-by-moscow/2017/07/19/b6821a62-6beb-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.0c54d92b07bd),
the Trump administration ended a secretive CIA operation to arm moderate
Syrian rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad. Few details on what
arms they received are known publicly, [but researchers found numerous
[rockets in Iraq]{.mark} that appear to [have been purchased by the
United States and supplied to Syria]{.mark}n groups]{.underline}.

In one instance, PG-9 73mm rockets, sold by Romanian arms manufacturers
to the U.S. Army in 2013 and 2014, were found sprinkled across both
battlefields. Containers with matching lot numbers were found in eastern
Syria and recovered from an Islamic State convoy in the Iraqi city of
Fallujah, the report says. The rockets, adapted by the Islamic State to
use in their launchers, gave militants a potent weapon against
U.S.-supplied tanks and armored Humvees.

Records obtained by CAR from Romanian officials include agreements
[indicating the United States would not re-export those and other
weapons, part of an effort to curb weapons trafficking. [Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [was]{.mark} another [source of **unauthorized
weapons transfers** to Syria]{.mark}, the report says.]{.underline}

CAR's report says the U.S. government did not respond to requests to
trace this and other weapons documented by its researchers.

In a statement to The Washington Post, Defense Department spokesman Eric
Pahon did not dispute reports of U.S.-provided weapons recovered by ISIS
militants. "Wherever possible," he said, "our advisers will monitor the
use of the weapons and supplies we give the \[Syrian Democratic
Forces\], ensuring use only against ISIS. Any alleged misuse or
diversion of U.S. support will be taken seriously and lead to the
possible curtailment of support, if verified."

**[[It took only weeks for]{.mark} the [Islamic State to get]{.mark} its
[hands on U.S.]{.mark} antitank [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**

On Dec. 12, 2015, Bulgaria exported antitank missile launcher tubes to
the U.S. Army through an Indiana-based company called Kiesler Police
Supply. Fifty-nine days later, Iraqi federal police captured the remains
of one such weapon after a battle in Ramadi, Iraq, the report says. In
another instance, a U.S.-backed rebel group in Syria was photographed
using a launcher tube with an identical lot number, indicating it
probably came from the same batch, the report says.

[The episode [illustrates how quickly U.S.-supplied arms can be **turned
against** ]{.mark}**its [allies]{.mark}**, reshape a battlefield and
pose danger to the small teams of U.S. Special Operations
troops]{.underline} who routinely travel in vehicles that aren't made to
withstand antitank weapons.

**Industrial-scale operations and experimentation was key to spread
death and fear**

CAR investigators noted materials such as aluminum paste and other
precursor chemicals from Turkey used to make charges for mortars and
rockets were found in Tikrit, Mosul, Fallujah and elsewhere in Iraq.
That signifies a robust logistical operation for delivering raw
materials to Islamic State researchers and engineers manning
captured industrial machines and churning out components for munitions,
the report says.

["It confirms my theory that [this is the **industrial revolution** of
terrorism]{.mark}," Damien Spleeters, head of CAR operations in Iraq and
Syria, [recently told
Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/terror-industrial-complex-isis-munitions-supply-chain/).
"And for that they need raw material in industrial
quantities."]{.underline} Militants also modified some shoulder-fired
rockets using raw materials to reduce the severity of heat from rocket
launches, which is dangerous in confined urban spaces, Wired reported.

#### ISIS uses American weapons originally supplied to Syria and Iraq government

**Crawford 17**, Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security Producer,
Pentagon and National Security reporter for CNN, 12/14/17, "Report
details where ISIS gets its weapons",
<https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/14/politics/isis-weapons-report/index.html>

Conflict Armament Research deployed a team of field investigators across
ISIS frontline positions in both Iraq and Syria between July 2014 and
November 2017, and analyzed more than 40,000 items recovered from ISIS
forces.

Researchers deployed with local forces fighting ISIS, mainly Iraqi
government forces in Iraq and Kurdish forces in northern Syria, and
studied everything recovered or left behind by ISIS in liberated areas.

The [[items]{.mark} recovered [encompassed]{.mark} everything from
[weapons, ammunition]{.mark} as well as [chemical components]{.mark}
procured by the terror group to manufacture improvised explosive devices
([IEDs]{.mark})]{.underline} to be used on the battlefield.

While 90% of the weapons and ammunition studied originated in China,
Russia, Eastern Europe, the report also said [some of the
[weapons]{.mark} that were eventually [diverted to ISIS was **originally
provided by the US**]{.mark} and Saudi Arabia [to Syrian
opposition]{.mark} forces over the course of the conflict]{.underline}.

The report concluded that \"[international [weapons supplies to
factions]{.mark} in the Syrian conflict [have significantly
augmented]{.mark} the [**quantity and quality** of weapons available to
ISIS]{.mark} forces]{.underline} \-- in numbers far beyond those that
would have been available to the group through battlefield capture
alone.\"

At the same time, the report also found instances where weapons deployed
by ISIS were found to have been diverted from stockpiles in other
conflict regions such as Libya and moved on to Iraq and Syria.

#### Infiltration of US weapons into ISIS has greatly increased their military power

**McKernan 17**, Bethan McKernan, Turkey and Middle East Correspondent
at Guardian News & Media, 12/15/17, "US and Saudi Arabia arms
significantly enhanced ISIS' military capabilities, report reveals",
<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-us-saudi-arabia-arms-fighters-jihadis-military-capability-enhanced-weapons-syria-terrorism-a8112076.html>

An extensive field investigation into the origins
of [Isis](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/isis)' weaponry
in [Syria](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/syria)and [Iraq](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/iraq) has
found that [[weapons supplied by the US]{.mark} and Saudi Arabia to the
Syrian opposition often [ended up in the jihadis' hands,
enhancing]{.mark} the "**[quantity and quality" of their
armaments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 

While most weapons in Isis' arsenal were captured from the Syrian and
Iraqi armies, Conflict Armament Research (CAR)'s report, published on
Thursday, found that [[the number of US]{.mark} and Saudi supplied
[weapons in Isis' arsenal goes "**far beyond those**]{.mark} **that
would have been available [through battle capture]{.mark}**
alone".]{.underline}

[["Iraq and Syria have seen Isis]{.mark} forces [use large numbers of
weapons, supplied by]{.mark} states such as Saudi Arabia and [the United
States]{.mark}, against the various international anti-Isis
coalitions]{.underline} that the two states support," researchers found.

The US and Saudi supplied weapons were all manufactured in EU countries,
and Washington and Riyadh had broken contractual clauses prohibiting
their transfer, CAR said.

"[Evidence collected by CAR indicates that [the United States has
**repeatedly diverted** EU-manufactured weapons]{.mark} and ammunition
[to]{.mark} opposition [forces in]{.mark} the [Syria]{.mark}n conflict.
**[Isis]{.mark} forces rapi[dly gained custody]{.mark}** [of
**significant quantities** of this material]{.mark}," it
said]{.underline}. 

"\[The findings are\] a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in
supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and
overlapping non-state armed groups operate."

The analysis of more than 40,000 items found that in total, however,
about 90 per cent of the weapons and ammunition overall were made in
Russia, China and Eastern Europe.

Three per cent of Isis' arsenal was Nato-grade. The report also found
that over the last three years had been able to produce its own
military-grade weapons and standardise production across the so-called
caliphate.

### Yes ISIS Nuke

#### ISIS can get a nuke

<https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/07/is-the-threat-of-nuclear-terrorism-distracting-attention.html>

[At the final Nuclear Summit of his presidency in Washington, D.C., in
2016, Barack [Obama said the risk of ISIS or other extremist groups
acquiring nuclear weapons remains ["one of the greatest threats to
global
security."](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/isis-nuclear-bomb-is-a-serious-threat-warns-barack-obama-a6964621.html)]{.mark} A
number of terrorist groups, including]{.underline} [[ISIS and al-Qaeda,
have expressed explicit intentions to acquire and use nuclear
material]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, countries face far more pressing
threats than nuclear terrorism and authorities would be better off
focusing on insurgents\' frequent use of conventional weapons, such as
chemicals and bombs. Nuclear terrorism, defined as [["the use or threat
to use nuclear material, nuclear fuel, or radioactive products for acts
of
terrorism,"]{.underline}](http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/international-convention-suppression-acts-nuclear-terrorism/) has
elicited global concern and action, as demonstrated by the UN Global
Counter-Terrorism Strategy, NATO\'s Defence Against Terrorism Programme,
and the [[EU Counter-Terrorism
Strategy]{.underline}](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/fight-against-terrorism/eu-strategy/).
[[There is also a large amount of nuclear material present throughout
the world; the current global stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU)
stands at 1.6 million kg]{.mark}.]{.underline} To construct a nuclear
bomb, terrorists would need 25 kg of HEU. This, compared to the amount
held by states throughout the world, is [[not an impossible amount for
terrorists to
obtain]{.underline}](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/nuclear-terrorism-fact-sheet).
To contextualize this, in 2015 the United States possessed 62,900 tons
of [[recoverable
uranium]{.underline}](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx).
[[Several terrorist groups have declared a desire to acquire nuclear
material to construct a "dirty bomb." In 1998, Osama bin Laden, in a
speech entitled ["Nuclear Bomb of
Islam"](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx)stated
that, "It is the duty of Muslims to prepare as much force as possible to
terrorize the enemies of God."]{.underline}]{.mark}In 2014, after
capturing the Iraqi city of Mosul, [[ISIS had
access]{.underline}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-isis-nearly-stumbled-on-the-ingredients-for-a-dirty-bomb/2017/07/22/6a966746-6e31-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fe9a29c68b1c) to
two caches of Cobalt 60 locked in a storage room at Mosul University.
This material has lethal levels of radiation, is used to treat cancer
cells, and is the core ingredient of a nuclear bomb. Government
officials and nuclear experts speculated that ISIS failed to utilize it,
because [[they could not determine how to access the Cobalt
60]{.underline}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-isis-nearly-stumbled-on-the-ingredients-for-a-dirty-bomb/2017/07/22/6a966746-6e31-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fe9a29c68b1c) without
exposing themselves to deadly radiation. In 2016, after the two ISIS
brothers involved in the Brussels bombings, [[Khalid and Ibrahim
el-Bakraoui, were killed]{.mark} and captured, [authorities discovered
they had been [secretly
watching](http://time.com/4271854/belgium-isis-nuclear-power-station-brussels/) a

#### There's a detrimental risk of ISIS getting their hand on materials to build nuclear weapons

Joe **Cirincione 16**, president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security
foundation, and is the author of Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World
before It Is Too Late and Bomb Scare, 10/7/16, "The Risk of a Nuclear
ISIS Grows",
<https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-risk-of-a-nuclear-isi_b_8259978>

[[ISIS has already shown its willingness to [use chemical
weapons](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/world/middleeast/syrian-familys-agony-raises-specter-of-chemical-warfare.html?_r=0)
against civilian targets]{.mark}, so there should be no question that if
given the means and opportunity, [they would do the same with nuclear or
radiological weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} As I have [written
before](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/preventing-a-nuclear-isis_b_6180120):
The risks of ISIS getting a nuclear bomb are small. But they are not
zero\... it is impossible now for ISIS to build a nuclear bomb from
scratch. Doing so would require large, industrial facilities to enrich
uranium, billions of dollars and gigawatts of energy. But if they could
get the highly-enriched uranium --- about 100 pounds would do, about the
size of a soccer ball --- it is possible that they could assemble the
equipment and small technical team to build the bomb. [[What is far more
likely, though, is that ISIS could get its hands on enough radioactive
material to produce a dirty bomb.]{.mark}]{.underline} Some of the
government stings reported by the *AP* [involved
uranium](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34461732), which the
suppliers said could be used for a dirty bomb. While uranium and
plutonium are needed for the core of a nuclear weapon, they are not
ideal for a dirty bomb. You want something much more radioactive, like
cesium or americium. A few grams of these powders could contaminate tens
of square blocks, making them uninhabitable for months, until they were
scrubbed clean. Unfortunately, cesium was exactly what smugglers were
attempting to sell to ISIS agents in February. [What is a dirty
bomb](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/c0d3e8/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-joseph-cirincione)
though? Unlike a nuclear weapon, this is not a nuclear explosion but a
conventional explosive, like dynamite, laced with small quantities of
highly radioactive material. Few, if any people, would die in a dirty
bomb attack. It's a long-term threat. A true terror weapon that would
panic a city with the fear that exposure would cause cancer, birth
defects or heavy metal poisoning over the years. Think of it as if
somebody sprayed asbestos in your apartment building. No one would die
and you could go in and out of it, but nobody would for fear of exposing
themselves to cancer-causing agents. [[It is]{.mark} likely [just a
matter of time before ISIS]{.mark} --- or some other terrorist group ---
[gets some radioactive material.]{.mark}]{.underline} We have been lax
in clearing out abandoned radioactive material production sites and
increasing the security of remaining ones. Between 1993 and 2013 the
[IAEA reported](http://www-ns.iaea.org/security/itdb.asp) that there
were almost 2500 confirmed incidents of radiological smuggling
worldwide. 664 incidents involved the theft or loss of nuclear or
radiological materials. 16 involved highly enriched uranium or
plutonium. And these are just the ones that we know about. Ironically,
and tragically, the more military success we have against ISIS, the
greater the demand may be for theses weapons. ISIS is the first
terrorist group that behaves like a state. It has territory to defend, a
future to protect. They may want a nuclear bomb for the same reason
states do: defense. If our military actions truly threaten them, they
will threaten to go nuclear, hoping to deter our attacks. Short of a
nuclear explosive bomb, a dirty bomb threat may serve the same function.
So what can be done to prevent this scenario? As I talked about on [*Fox
News*](http://video.foxnews.com/v/4540257598001), there are three
primary areas that we need to focus on. First we must revitalize
U.S.-Russia cooperation on securing and eliminating nuclear materials.
It is more than likely that all of the material seized in the Moldova
stings came from Russia. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there
has been a real concern that poorly secured nuclear materials will fall
into the wrong hands. Over the last several decades, billions of dollars
have been spent securing those materials, but a recent study by Matthew
Bunn and his Harvard colleagues warns: Weapons-usable nuclear materials
still remain 'dangerously vulnerable,' with security systems that do not
provide effective protection against the full spectrum of plausible
adversary threats. Major gaps remain in the security of Russia's nuclear
arsenal and its huge stockpiles of bomb material. Unfortunately,
Russia's withdrawal from key aspects of nuclear cooperation programs in
recent years is now an even greater cause for concern. We must work with
the Russians to get them back on board with the existing [Cooperative
Threat Reduction
programs](http://www.state.gov/t/isn/offices/c55411.htm). Second, we
must reduce as much as possible our own use of dangerous nuclear and
radiological materials. As Senator Sam Nunn recently
[wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/taking-the-dirty-bomb-threat-seriously/2015/08/21/04ddb148-45ca-11e5-8e7d-9c033e6745d8_story.html)
in *The Washington Post*, "Although securing the materials is crucial, a
better option exists for some isotopes that would result in permanent
threat reduction. Thanks to recent technological advances, it is no
longer necessary to use one of the most dangerous materials, cesium-137,
in medical and scientific equipment." Furthermore: We need to strengthen
the regulatory framework for the security of radiological sources. As
noted in a 2012 Government Accountability Office report, security
requirements put forth by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
are too broadly written. The NRC should provide medical facilities with
specific steps they must take to develop and sustain a more effective
security program. These are straightforward and common sense solutions
to a serious potential threat and should be implemented as quickly as
possible. Finally we must work to develop and implement rigorous,
consistent standards for the nations that do use these materials. Again
as Sen. Nunn has said, The international community should do more. Last
year, 23 countries at the Nuclear Security Summit agreed to secure their
most dangerous radioactive materials. Other countries should join this
pledge. Next year's summit offers governments a valuable opportunity to
announce their fulfilled commitments and launch a major new initiative
to replace all\... dangerous radiological sources where alternatives
exist*.* [Even more importantly though, [the U.S. needs to rethink our
overall nuclear strategy. Our]{.mark} [current strategy is]{.mark} still
based on [fighting a nuclear war with Russia]{.mark}. [We should refocus
it]{.mark}, and [stop spending billions on an obsolete U.S. nuclear
arsenal and move at least part of those funds to preventing ISIS or any
other group from getting their hands on radioactive materials]{.mark}.
It's time to stop fighting Soviets and shift our funds to fighting the
terrorists that truly threaten us.]{.underline}

[The risk of [ISIS getting their hands on nuclear]{.mark} or
radiological [weapons]{.mark} is small, but it is not zero. And that [is
too big of a gamble to take when American lives are on the
line.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### US supply weapons to PKK (terrorists) but not Turkey

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/erdogan-nato-arms-terrorists-turkey-190218142920831.html

President Recep Tayyip [[Erdogan]{.mark} has [accused NATO allies of
**supporting \"terrorists**]{.mark}\" [with]{.mark} thousands of
truckloads of [weapons while **ignoring Turkey**]{.mark}**\'s** request
to buy their arms]{.underline}. \"What kind of NATO alliance is this?\"
Erdogan said on Monday during an election campaign rally in southwestern
Turkey\'s Burdur region. \"[[You give terrorists]{.mark} around 23,000
truckloads of [weapons and tools through Iraq]{.mark}, [but when we
asked]{.mark}, [you won\'t]{.mark} even [sell them to
us]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he added. \"We have a 911-kilometre border
\[with Syria\]. We\'re under threat at any moment.\" Erdogan did not
specify which nations were allegedly supplying arms through Iraq. Turkey
also expects Syria\'s Manbij region to be rid of \"terrorists\" and left
to locals as soon as possible, said the Turkish leader. [Manbij has been
held by the United States-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a
militia spearheaded by the Kurdish People\'s Protection Unit (YPG),
since 2016. This has angered neighbouring Turkey, which views the
influence wielded by the YPG in northern Syria as a national security
threat]{.underline}. Ankara considers the YPG a \"terrorist group\" with
ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK) in Turkey. PKK has
waged a decades-long armed conflict in the country, killing an estimated
40,000 people. Ankara has threatened to target Manbij in a military
operation to wipe out the YPG. But [[the Kurdish militia]{.mark} [has
been Washington\'s **main ally**]{.mark} in the ground war [against

future is an awfully difficult business. [But there are a few things
that we do know]{.mark}, and [which point to a]{.mark} narrow [path that
might salvage]{.mark} [the alliance]{.mark}. To tread it, [we need to
understand the true character of the]{.mark} S-400 [crisis and
avoid]{.mark} some [past]{.mark} [mistakes]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The West is not wrong to worry that Turkey's S-400s would allow Russia
to learn about the F-35's]{.mark} unique radar returns or NATO's
encrypted datalinks. [Even if Ankara has no such intentions, it can make
no assurances against the cyber and intelligence vulnerabilities for
which the Russian-made missiles and their operators would be a
vector.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Turkey is also hosting one of the
forward-deployed X-band radars for NATO's missile defense shield and is
home to the Incirlik Air Base, a major staging point for American
military operations in the region. Depending on where Ankara deploys its
S-400s, one or both could fall in its range, raising a considerable risk
should the U.S. and Russia go to war.

[[Had the problem been merely technical, it could have been solved.
Turkey could have shelved its S-400s without ever unpacking them. Or it
could have established a data link to verifiably de-activate its
radars]{.mark} [whenever an F-35 is flying, or]{.mark} made a
round-the-clock [intelligence-sharing arrangement]{.mark}]{.underline}
that would allow U.S. troops to monitor the systems and their operators.
All these options were discussed, at least in the public domain, along
with even more far-fetched proposals, such as deploying the missiles in
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus or gifting them to a close ally
like Qatar or Azerbaijan.

[[The challenge,]{.mark} however, [is]{.mark} more political than
technical. It is partly a [lack of trust]{.mark}, partly a fit of spite.
[Much]{.mark} of the [blame belongs to Turkey, but the United States
bears a portion as well]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Turkey scoffs that the backlash it gets for its S-400 deal is just
another piece of evidence of its Western allies' double standards. It
had sought to buy the U.S.-made PAC-3 Patriot, but was rebuffed. More
than a dozen countries have bought or are buying the PAC-3. If Sweden
(facing no obvious missile threat), Romania (carrying a much lesser
share of NATO's burden), and Saudi Arabia (certainly not a paragon of
good governance) can have Patriots, why was Turkey given so much
trouble? Greece, Turkey's perennial rival in the Aegean, already has
both American-made Patriots and Russian-made S-300s, which it received
in the late 1990s over Ankara's fierce protestations. Why can't Turkey
do what Greece already has done?

[[These grievances are not baseless, but]{.mark} they are slightly
[misleading]{.mark}. [Turkey demanded several conditions in a Patriot
deal, including technology transfer, that were more onerous]{.mark} than
almost [everyone else]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, the political
context is less hospitable: Russia is back on the world stage, flexing
its muscles, and under a punitive sanctions regime. It's a different
world we live in.

It may be true that Turkey is getting a rougher deal than others in
similar conditions. India, too, is mulling an S-400 purchase and seeking
a waiver from Washington, which was happy to bend its stringent
non-proliferation laws to curry favor with New Delhi, because there are
simply more reasons to placate India, and less antipathy for its leader,
Narendra Modi. This is not to say that the S-400 crisis was unavoidable
--- it wasn't --- or that the U.S. did everything right --- it didn't
--- but none of this diminishes the gravity of Turkey's own strategic
misconduct. Ankara did things that it knew would have consequences and
is now complaining about facing them. As former U.S. attorney Robert
Morgenthau once quipped, you are not immune to the law merely because
your prosecutor happens not to like you.

Washington's attitude --- call it hubris, hypocrisy, or any other name
--- might have helped to stoke the fire, but it was Ankara that turned
it into an inferno. President Erdogan, who never lacked illiberal
tendencies and an Islamist's antipathy for the West, seized on it to
play up Turkey's longstanding grievance that it is allowed to guard the
camp but not allowed inside the tent. In doing so, he broke the levees
of Turkey's deep reservoir of anti-Americanism, recently stoked by the
United States' terribly miscalculated strategy in Syria.

This is the story numbers tell as well. [[A]{.mark} recent survey [by
Kadir Has University found that the percentage of those viewing the U.S.
as the biggest threat to Turkey grew]{.mark} dramatically since last
year, jumping [from 60.2 to 81.3 percent. Almost half of the respondents
cited Washington's alliance with the Syrian]{.mark} Democratic Forces
([SDF), the Syrian offshoot of the]{.mark} Kurdistan Workers Party
[(PKK), as the primary reason for their distrust]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the U.S., and stated that the S-400s should be purchased no matter what.
Seeing America with suspicion is one of the only things that unite the
supporters and detractors of Erdogan. Washington would be remiss to
ignore this reality as it charts its course forward.

On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced that it would make good
on its threat to eject Turkey from the F-35 program over the S-400. So,
what happens next? The first order of business is to not do stupid
things, which is a bigger achievement than it sounds. NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's Wednesday statement was
refreshingly conciliatory --- "Turkey as a NATO member is much more than
S-400" --- but it may not echo in other forums like the U.S. Congress,
which recently decided to lift the arms embargo on Cyprus at a time of
rising tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although Erdogan is still
formidable, his hold on power is more precarious than ever. His
opponents are making unprecedented strides, his former friends are
mutinying, and his existing allies are unreliable. There is nothing that
would serve him more riht now than an excuse to rally 'round the flag.

Second, ignore the Blob. Washington's experts didn't get Turkey right
then, and they are not getting it right now either. Those who grumble
that they are sick of Turkey and that the United States is better off
without it were praising Erdogan for doing everything he can to force a
more democratic and open country while he was unlawfully purging his
secular opponents in show trials that even he ultimately disowned. The
same Kadir Has University survey also shows that a strong majority of
Turkey --- including voters of Erdogan's party --- are still supporting
the country's aspirations to join the European Union and its membership
in NATO. The remedy to the West's fears over Turkey is to pull it
towards the West, not to push it further away. Doing so is neither easy
nor cost-free, but the alliance is, no matter how imperfect, still
better than its absence.

Third, if you want to win against Erdogan, you have to do it in his own
game. The most important --- and difficult --- task is to change
perceptions of the Turkish public and win back its support. Negotiate
not only with the politicians and behind closed doors, but also with the
public and out in the open. Do not let Erdogan shape the narrative all
by himself. For every next step in the crisis, explain the stakes, point
out the off-ramps, and communicate them clearly and publicly. If Erdogan
drives past them, let him own his decision and its consequences.

When possible, confront Ankara's contradictions. When the Russian option
gained prominence, the supposed reason was that Moscow offered better
terms on cost, delivery, and technology. The notion has since been
debunked: had this been the logic that guided Ankara's choice, it would
have bought the Aster-30, not the S-400. Take Ankara to task for it:
from bilateral agreements to defense-industrial cooperation under NATO,
it is possible to devise various mutually profitable schemes that, if
accepted, would pull the plug on the S-400s, and, if turned down, would
put on Ankara the onus of explaining to its people why they are
shouldering this burden.

If you are going to get tough, use a scalpel, not an ax. Putting
Turkey's defense companies out of business, straining its already
fragile economy in ways that will cost ordinary citizens, or playing
with the country's tripwires in Northern Syria or the Eastern
Mediterranean would break things that we may prove unable to fix later.
Erdogan's underbelly is his cronies, whose corruption angers his
opponents and supporters alike. Their parochial interests were crucially
important in bringing about the S-400 deal. Whatever its cost, let them
be the ones paying it --- do not bill their greed to the entire country.

And, finally, think about your long game. [Erdogan will go, sooner or
later, but Turkey will remain]{.mark}. It is time for Turkey's friends
in the West and the West's friends in Turkey to sit down, have an honest
heart-to-heart, and start thinking about how we ensure that the alliance
outlasts Erdogan. [The battle to save the U.S.-Turkish relationship will
not be an easy one, but we have not lost it just yet]{.mark}

### AS k2 PKK

#### PKK should lay down arms against turkey 

**Ahval** 1/10/**19** "United States needs to convince PKK to drop
insurgency in Turkey -- columnist"
https://ahvalnews.com/pkk/united-states-needs-convince-pkk-drop-insurgency-turkey-columnist

The United States needs to offer a "grand bargain" to Turkish President
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over the Syrian Kurdish issue, a Turkish columnist
wrote in the Washington Post.

Because Erdoğan will not accept an autonomous Kurdish state on his
border over fears it will feed the existing Kurdistan Workers' Party's
(PKK) insurgency in Turkey, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} try to [persuade the PKK to lay down its arms against
Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}, columnist Asli Aydintaşbaş wrote.

The article comes after Erdoğan refused to meet with White House
national security advisor John Bolton this week. Bolton had said in
Israel during his oversees trip that the Syrian Kurds of the People's
Protection Units (YPG) must be protected during a U.S. troop withdrawal.
The comments angered Ankara, which counts the YPG as a severe threat,
has launched two military operations against them since 2016, and is
currently planning a third.

"[[Washington would have to]{.mark} somehow [convince the PKK]{.mark},
YPG's parent organization, [to declare a cease-fire]{.mark} [and
withdraw its forces from Turkey]{.mark} --- [in return for Kurdish
autonomy in Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}," Aydintaşbaş wrote. "Such a
grand bargain would appeal to Kurds and Turks if there were a serious
U.S. commitment."

Without the PKK in Turkey, Erdoğan has no "valid" reason to oppose the
Syrian Kurds, she wrote. Aydintaşbaş suggests stabilizing the area by
establishing Turkish and Kurdish zones of influence.

"Kurds would have autonomy in Kurdish-majority towns such as Kobani,
Serikani and Afrin, and Turkey would be the patron saint of remaining
Sunni Arab towns," she wrote.

Instead of persuading Erdoğan to accept the YPG on Turkey's borders,
[Bolton can sit down with [Kurds and Ankara to find a solution that
would eliminate the PKK and bring autonomy to Syrian
Kurds]{.mark},]{.underline} she wrote. She noted that a peace process
had been underway during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) reign,
until it collapsed in 2015, when the Turkish state and PKK resumed
fighting.

"In the good old days, Ankara actively sought peace with the Kurds and
intense negotiations continued on and off for eight years," Aydintaşbaş
wrote. "[The process fell apart only because the Kurdish gains in Syria
led the PKK to walk back its earlier promises and Ankara to freak out
about the Kurdish expansion on its borders. To fix it, we need to go
back to the map of Syria]{.underline}."

### PKK Key

#### Turkey-US conflict inevitable if America continues to support YPG\-\-- Turkish air strikes and deals with Russia bring countries closer to the brink 

Colin H. **Kahl 17-** Senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies\' Center for International Security and
Cooperation and strategic consultant at the Penn-Biden Center for
Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Deputy assistant to President Barack
Obama 2014-2017, May 12, 2017, "The United States and Turkey Are on a
Collision Course in Syria",
https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/12/the-united-states-and-turkey-are-on-a-collision-course-in-syria-trump/

America's relationship with Turkey has entered a period of deep crisis.
At the heart of the matter is continued U.S. support for Syrian Kurds
fighting the Islamic State. The [[partnership between the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} a coalition of Kurdish People's Protection
Units [(YPG]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} Syrian Arab militias,]{.underline}
[currently known as]{.underline} the Syrian Democratic Forces
[([SDF]{.mark}),]{.underline} [[began more than two years
ago]{.underline}]{.mark} under President Barack Obama. President [Donald
[Trump]{.mark}'s administration [continues to back]{.mark} the
50,000-strong SDF]{.underline} as the most capable anti-Islamic State
force in northern Syria. The SDF are now closing in on Raqqa, the
capital of the Islamic State's self-described caliphate, and
[[Trump]{.mark} has [approved a plan to provide arms directly to the
YPG]{.mark}]{.underline} for the final push. Yet [[Turkey sees]{.mark}
the [SDF as mortal enemies]{.mark} [due to]{.mark} the [YPG's
affiliation with]{.mark} the Kurdistan Worker's Party
([PKK),]{.mark}]{.underline} [[a]{.mark} designated [terrorist
organization]{.mark}]{.underline} which has fought a bloody insurgency
inside Turkey for three decades. These [clashing interests have put
Washington and Ankara on a collision course]{.underline} just as the
U.S.-led campaign to crush the caliphate enters its culminating phase.

Turkey's concerns about the YPG are understandable and widely
appreciated. What is less well known is the fact that it was Turkey's
own actions, in particular a set of decisions made by President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, that stymied joint U.S.-Turkey efforts to identify an
alternative anti-Islamic State force. This pushed the United States and
the YPG closer together and eventually created the SDF. And, with Raqqa
in their sights, the Trump administration is unlikely to abandon them
now.

In the closing days of the Obama administration, President Barack Obama
was willing to increase training and assistance to the SDF, including
YPG elements, for the final push on the Islamic State's capital. But
retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's incoming national security
advisor, asked the administration to hold off so the new team could run
its own review. (We now know that Flynn was paid to represent Turkish
government interests prior to becoming national security advisor,
although it is unclear whether that had any impact on the decision.)

After surveying the options, the Trump administration seems to have come
to the same conclusion Obama did: the SDF represent the only viable
force to seize Raqqa anytime soon. Nevertheless, the Trump
administration decided to delay providing additional support to the SDF
--- especially armaments directly to the YPG --- for months out of
deference to the U.S.-Turkey alliance and Erdogan's domestic politics.
The hope appears to have been that waiting until after Turkey's April 16
referendum on enhancing the power of the presidency would give Erdogan
less incentive to whip up nationalist sentiment against the American
plan. Following the narrow approval of the referendum consolidating
Erdogan's power, Trump even took the controversial step of calling
Erdogan to congratulate him, most likely to make the bitter pill of the
Raqqa operation easier to swallow. Erdogan was also invited to meet with
Trump at the White House, a political boon to the Turkish president
given rising international criticism over Turkey's democratic
backsliding.

It didn't work[. On [April 25,]{.mark} [Turkish warplanes struck YPG and
PKK positions]{.mark} on both sides of the Syria-Iraq
border]{.underline}. The bombing raid against a YPG command center on
Mount Karachok in northeastern Syria --- [which occurred [only a few
miles from where]{.mark} [U.S. troops were
operating]{.mark}]{.underline} --- killed 20 YPG fighters.
[Meanwhile,]{.underline} the [[Turkish strikes in northwestern
Iraq]{.mark}, which [targeted the PKK]{.mark}]{.underline} on Mount
Sinjar, [[mistakenly killed]{.mark} [severa]{.mark}l [Kurdish
Peshmerga]{.mark}]{.underline} troops instead. There was no formal
coordination with the United States, and the U.S. military was given
less than an hour's notice prior to the Turkish operation. In the days
since, U.S. forces have been patrolling the Syrian side of Turkey-Syria
border, acting as de facto peacekeepers to deter the two side from going
at each other's throats.

**[[Erdoga]{.mark}n has [warned that Turkey will continue to strike the
YPG unless the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [abandons its partnership
with them]{.mark},]{.underline}** even as [[Turkey has thrown]{.mark}
its [support behind]{.mark} [a Russian proposal]{.mark}]{.underline} [to
create "de-escalation zones"]{.underline} to freeze the conflict
elsewhere in Syria. **[One [Erdogan advisor even hinted that U.S. forces
could be struck]{.mark} if they continue to back the Syrian
Kurds]{.underline}**. [[If Turkey follows through]{.mark} with these
threats, [it could trigger a Turkey-Kurd border war]{.mark} that derails
the Raqqa campaign, [undermining]{.mark} a core [national
security]{.mark} interest [of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. And, if a military mistake by Turkey
results in the death of U.S. forces, [**[it could bring Washington and
Ankara]{.mark}** --- [two NATO allies --- **into direct
conflict.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

When Erdogan travels to Washington next week, American support for the
Syrian Kurds will be the top issue he raises with Trump[. Erdogan is
likely to urge Trump to cancel his decision to arm the YPG
and]{.underline} look for other alternatives to take Raqqa --- moves
Trump is unlikely to take. Does that mean the two NATO allies are fated
for an irreparable breach? No. But it does mean that, between now and
then[, [the admin]{.mark}istration [needs to develop a comprehensive
plan to ease tensions, before it is too late]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
campaign to defeat the Islamic State and the future of the U.S.-Turkey
alliance hang in the balance.

### PKK Key -- AT: S-400

#### PKK a key to US- Saudi relations, not S-400

Barçin **Yinanç 19**, Turkish daily news editor, 4/23/19," US support to
PKK actual irritant to Ankara, not S-400"
<http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/barcin-yinanc/us-support-to-pkk-actual-irritant-to-ankara-not-s-400-142851>

"I advise you to open Pentagon's website and [check the 2020 budget for
Iraq and Syria. You will see a budget earmarked for C4 explosives to be
used in the fight against terrorism. You don't fight terrorism with C4
explosives**; you use C4 if you want to do terror**]{.underline}," a
Turkish official told me when I was in Washington last week for a
Turkish-U.S. conference.

"What does it tell us?" I asked. "The PKK tells the Americans: 'We
fought DAESH \[ISIL\], we lost our men in this fight; give us whatever
we want,'" the official replied.

The serious blow dealt to ties with Pentagon as a result of Turkish
refusal in 2003 to let U.S. soldiers pass through Turkey to attack Iraq
is being retaliated. This refusal left a deep mark on the U.S. military
establishment; they cannot get over it. "The U.S. military keeps saying
'injustice was made to us; we will never forget it.' But they need to
forget it," said Mehmet Ali Yalçındağ, the president of the
Turkish-American Business Council.

What this incident means to the Americans, [[the current U.S. assistance
to Kurdish armed forces in Syria means the same to Ankara. It is seen as
a direct support to the illegal PKK]{.underline},
[a]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.-designated [[terror
organization]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ankara says, and the U.S. no longer
contests, that the YPG is the PKK's wing in Syria.

This is leaving a deep wound on the Turkish side. This open military
support to the PKK vindicates decades-old suspicions in Ankara on U.S.
intentions in its relations with different Kurdish groups in the region
ever since the Gulf War.

Add to that, the conviction --- justified or not --- that government
[[part of the U.S. establishment helped flourish FETÖ,]{.mark}
[which]{.mark} is believed to have staged the coup attempt in 2016, and
all this [consolidates the belief in Ankara that the U.S. establishment
is against]{.mark}]{.underline} the Justice and Development Party (AKP),
but also against [[the Turkish state]{.mark}/establishment]{.underline},
even if the latter harbors secularists who are not exactly supportive of
all the current government policies.

The frustration and anger in Ankara is exacerbated as its centuries-old
defense reflexes are coded to manage threats from its neighbor Russia,
with which it had fought nearly a dozen wars in history, not from the
U.S., with which it has historically had good ties and shared a
relationship of alliance.

In other words, Russian support to the PKK would create less shockwaves
in comparison to the U.S. support.

[[Within this framework,]{.underline} [the Turkish government feels it
has a few options left other than counterbalancing the U.S. "hostility"
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russian ties.]{.underline}

[This brings us to Turkey's decision to purchase **[the S-400
anti-ballistic defense system]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Before the meeting of Turkish Finance and Treasury Minister Berat
Albayrak with U.S. President Donald Trump last week, I would have
likened the developments in the S-400 issue to a train crash in the
coming. [Everyone on both sides, with the exception of Turkish top
leadership, was ringing alarm bells that the delivery of the system
would mean a definite break in relations; something the Turkish economy
will not be able to handle]{.underline}. And it is this latter point
that seems to have pushed Ankara to be more accommodating. The news in
certain media outlets that the purchased S-400 could be deployed in a
third country has not been denied.

The fact that an adviser to the U.S. president traveled to Moscow right
after the Albayrak-Trump meeting was interpreted as part of a trilateral
traffic of ideas to solve the issue. There are rumors that Fiona Hill, a
senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National
Security Council and a name that is also very familiar with Turkish
issues, went to Moscow to convince the Russians on a separate formula.

Meanwhile, the fact that the two countries aim to increase their trade
volume to \$75 billion also suggests that this might come as part of an
understanding over the S-400s. Even though working groups at relevant
ministries will be set up to see the potential areas, the target of
raising the trade volume from the current \$20 plus billion to \$75
billion is seen too ambitious, suggesting that this can only be reached
through a deal involving a Turkish purchase from the U.S. aerospace or
military industry.

[[But even if the S-400 issue was solved]{.mark}, followed by other
irritants like the Halkbank case or the detention of U.S. missions'
Turkish personnel getting out of the way, the **[U.S. support to the
PKK, which Turkey sees as an existential threat, will continue to poison
relations.]{.mark}**]{.underline} And with that on the agenda all the
time, [the current lack of trust that are at the center of all problems
in Turkish-U.S. relations will continue creating new
problems]{.underline}

if the United States didn't already face enough troubles in Syria,
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently threatened American
troops with an "[Ottoman
slap](https://web.archive.org/web/20190614161532/https:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/erdogan-warns-u-s-troops-in-syria-to-keep-away-from-kurd-forces)"
if they interfered with Turkey's military incursion into northwestern
Syria. The threat, coming two days before a visit to Turkey by
then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, underscored just how contentious
relations between Ankara and Washington have become, and how close this
historic alliance is to crumbling altogether --- to the detriment of
both states.

**[[The]{.mark} list of [issues]{.mark} [dividing]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates and [Turkey is a long
one]{.mark}]{.underline}**. U.S. and other Western officials look with
alarm on Erdogan's Putinesque consolidation of power and disregard for
human rights, and have protested the arrest of U.S. citizens and Turks
employed by American diplomatic missions. Turkish officials, for their
part, accuse the United States of instigating a July 2016 coup attempt
against Erdogan and harboring the man most Turks believe was its
mastermind: the spiritual leader, erstwhile Erdogan ally, and
Pennsylvania resident Fethullah Gulen.

Even more sharply dividing Washington and Ankara are the divergent paths
they have tread in Syria for the better part of a decade. Erdogan was
furious at the Obama administration for what Turks perceived as U.S.
indifference to the threat the Syrian conflict posed to their country.
When the United States finally did intercede, only to make allies of the
Turks' mortal enemies --- the People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, a
Syrian offshoot of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) ---
Ankara's anger mounted. For their part, U.S. officials were troubled by
Ankara co-opting jihadis as allies in the Syrian fight, and more
recently with its cooperation with Russia, which has extended to the
purchase of a Russian air defense system that complicates Turkey's NATO
commitments.

The temptation is strong in Washington to simply jettison the foundering
alliance with Turkey

 --- as was recently done with Pakistan --- and even to impose sanctions
on Ankara for its actions. And the feeling in Turkey, where 67 percent
of the population harbors an [unfavorable view of
Americans](https://web.archive.org/web/20190614161532/http:/www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/2/country/224/response/Unfavorable/),
is surely mutual.

[**[Yet cutting Turkey loose would constitute a self-inflicted wound.
Turkey is]{.mark} not just** President Erdogan but **[a regional
geographic and economic giant that stands as a buffer between Europe and
the Middle East, and between the Middle East and Russia. Losing Turkey
as a]{.mark}** Western **[ally would mean bringing]{.mark}** the Mideast
to Europe's threshold, and the potential frontier of **[Russian
influence into the heart of the Middle East. Turkey is also the state
best positioned to balance against Iran,]{.mark}**]{.underline} whose
ambitions and influence are growing along with its partnership with
Russia. The dependency is mutual; [**[without the United States, Turkey
would be left to]{.underline}**]{.mark} Tehran and **[[Moscow's tender
mercies.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Preserving the Turkish-American alliance and the strategic value
both sides derive from it will require refocusing on shared strategic
threats, such as the growing Russia-Iran
alliance,]{.underline}]{.mark}** while compromising on the disagreements
distracting from that focus. While there is little the United States can
do to assuage Erdogan's more paranoid concerns, greater flexibility is
possible when it comes to the Syrian Kurds.

Vital to reaching a compromise are commitments made during Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson's recent visit to Ankara. According to Turkish
officials, the United States has reportedly agreed to decrease the
Kurdish militia presence west of the Euphrates River around the
strategic town of Manbij, which Turks fear is aimed at creating a
contiguous zone of Kurdish control along Turkey's southern border with
Syria. Turkey, in turn, could tolerate a continued American and YPG
presence in the Kurdish areas of northern Syria east of the Euphrates as
the only way to keep the U.S. in Syria.

Some in the United States see any accommodation of Turkish concerns
regarding the Syrian Kurds as a betrayal of a partner that proved
doughty in the fight against the Islamic State. Yet the proposed
arrangement holds advantages for all parties involved. For all its
bluster, Turkey would be far worse off without the United States as an
ally; what's more, U.S. influence is the best chance of convincing
Syrian Kurds to break with the PKK and forge their own path, as Iraqi
Kurds did.

As for the Kurds, the United States would not abandon them in their
homeland east of the Euphrates, but simply turn Manbij over to local
officials under U.S. and Turkish security guarantees. Kurdish
aspirations may be grander, but the United States is not obligated to
entertain its allies' every ambition here or elsewhere, especially when
those aims threaten another ally or the stability of the region.

For the United States, it would make little strategic sense to alienate
Turkey over the Kurdish issue. Turkey, the world's 17th largest economy
and one of the Middle East's primary military powers. In Syria itself,
the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops now in the country's northeast
cannot be reliably supplied without air and land access through Turkey,
given Iraq's susceptibility to Iranian influence. Indeed, it is
difficult to imagine the United States accomplishing much of anything in
Syria militarily or diplomatically in the face of determined Iranian and
Russian resistance if we cannot even manage to find common ground there
with our putative ally.

More broadly, [a [**U.S. effort to counter Iran in the Middle East, and
to prevail in**]{.mark} what the Trump administration has described as a
**[global strategic competition with Russia and China, will require
allies.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Whatever its tactical flirtations, Turkey
remains opposed to Iranian expansionism and wary of Russia for reasons
of [history](https://web.archive.org/web/20190614161532/https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Russo-Turkish_wars) and
geography. For China, [**[Turkey is an attractive candidate

### Yes Turkey Prolif

#### Turkey is in a unique position to develop nuclear weapons

Adam **Garfinkle 18,** the founding editor of The American Interest,
former editor of the national interest, speechwriter for both of
President George W. Bush\'s Secretaries of State, 9/3/18, "The
U.S.-Turkish Unraveling and the Arabs",
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/09/03/the-u-s-turkish-unraveling-and-the-arabs/

[The reasons for wanting to suppress such regional security competitions
have been several]{.underline}. First, competitions between and among
allies---Turkey and Greece, for example, over Cyprus---were thought to
provide opportunities for adversaries to divide alliances and complicate
alliance management.1 Second, [[competitions could breed local arms
races]{.mark}, and thus invite ambient insecurity and raise the costs of
any crises gotten out of hand]{.underline}. Third, [[some arms races
could lead to weapons-of-mass-destruction proliferation, threatening the
global security commons in general and generating a more dangerous world
overall for the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, as webmaster of the
system, to manage. From the U.S. point of view, minimizing the number
and size of wars and minimizing WMD proliferation constituted an act of
doing good and doing well simultaneously: It was valuable for most
others even as it was also valuable for the United States at the
pinnacle of the postwar pecking order.

The Cold War is over, but the imperative to limit WMD proliferation
remains---and so back to the Turkish situation we must go. Consider that
[**[Turkey sits in a]{.mark}** regional **[environment in
which]{.mark}** states armed with **[nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or prospectively armed with nuclear
weapons, **[[are abundant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[If a statesman or
military planner sits in a swivel chair in Ankara and rotates 360°
around, he can barely catch his breath between identifying actors
capable of targeting Turkey with nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}:
Russia, Pakistan, India, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the United
States both from its homeland and from other points in Europe, and of
course prospectively Iran.2

Now, the logic of the security dilemma is such that [[in the absence
of]{.mark} the credible [U.S]{.mark}. provision of [extended deterrence,
Turkey would feel pressure to develop its own nuclear
weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} That it has not exerted itself in that
direction, despite its formidable engineering and scientific capacities,
illustrates the stability of Turkish trust in U.S. protection---until
recently---and the ability of both sides to bracket the core security
relationship away from various disagreements. As with other
nuclear-armed states, [should Turkey go its own way it would do so with
no active intention of actually using such weapons, but rather as a kind
of insurance policy against diplomatic extortion at the hands of other
nuclear-armed powers.]{.underline}

But of course [[if Turkey]{.mark}, no longer tethered to U.S. security
protection in one way or another, [developed nuclear weapons]{.mark} for
such a purpose, **[other regional states would]{.mark}** probably [feel
obliged to **develop**]{.mark} or otherwise acquire **[their own
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, if they could, as an insurance policy
against nuclear extortion by Turkey.3 They have already practiced that
way of thinking in reaction to the possibility of an Iranian nuclear
breakout, of course.

Indeed, that kind of hedging behavior is exactly what analysts have
discussed for many years now as the so-called N+ danger inherent in the
development of Iranian nuclear weapons. [[It is not just the danger
posed by Iranian nuclear weapons, bad enough as that would be]{.mark},
but the mousetrap effect of proliferation that would likely [drive other
states to want]{.mark} such [an insurance policy]{.mark}: Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, Egypt, Algeria, and so on.]{.underline}

#### Turkey is in a unique position to develop nuclear weapons pt. 2

Wayne **McLean 18,** PhD Candidate with the National Security College at
the Australian National University and former Associate Lecturer in
International Relations with the University of Tasmania.,7/16/18,
"Turkey must be thinking of the Bomb",
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/turkey-must-be-thinking-bomb

[[Turkey]{.mark} has historically eschewed a nuclear programme because
it already [housed nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}: The US has
stationed missiles there since 1959. As part of NATO agreements, an
estimated 50 \"B61\" nuclear bombs still remain on Turkish soil at
Incirlik Air Base, in the country's south, as a deterrence measure.

**[[But Trump's disdain for NATO threatens this
arrangement]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In fact[, a 2015 Carnegie paper]{.underline} assessing Turkey's nuclear
posture [argued that [the **most probable scenario** under which Turkey
would seek nuclear weapons would be a collapse of]{.mark} its
[relations]{.mark}hips [with]{.mark} NATO and [the
US.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A variety of actors have an interest in Turkey losing its proxy nuclear
deterrent. [[Russia has embraced Ankara as a defence partner,]{.mark}
selling it the S-400 air defence missile shield which hedges against
total NATO dependence.]{.underline}

Both Iran and Syria would welcome the removal of nuclear weapons from
Incirlik, as it would reduce the US security presence in the region.

There are signs that [[Turkey has]{.mark} contingency [plans for the
removal of weapons]{.mark} too, [demonstrated by their pursuit of
nuclear latency:]{.mark}]{.underline} The material and technical
capabilities to produce weapons within a short time frame should the
need should arise.

A first piece of evidence is Turkey's consistent pursuit of nuclear
energy, which would enable the establishment of a fuel cycle to
manufacture weapons. Ankara first began pursuing nuclear power in the
1970s, but these efforts were disbanded after Pakistan's controversial
nuclear test in 1998.

Turkey then held concerns that any nuclear activity might be problematic
for their attempts to join the EU following widespread criticism of
Islamabad.

This reticence has changed in the current international environment.

[[Work]{.mark} recently [commenced on the Akkuyu nuclear station]{.mark}
on the Mediterranean Coast. The station interests strategic analysts for
a variety of reasons: It has a quick build time -- five years compared
to the International Atomic Energy Agency -- recommended 10--15 years;
and it will be the first nuclear station ever built under a
BOO]{.underline} (Buy Own Operate) model.

**[[The contractor is]{.mark} the [Russian company]{.mark}
Rosatom]{.underline}**, and operations, ownership of processes, and
inspection regimes are legislatively unclear under the BOO model.

[[The second piece of evidence is the increasing speed of Turkey's
indigenous ballistic missile programme]{.mark} and associated defence
products.]{.underline}

The first fully indigenous missile was demonstrated in April 2017. Its
development coincided with an increase of 39 per cent in domestic
defence development from 2016 to 2017.

Turkey plans to build its first nuclear power station at Akkuyu, in the
southern province of Mersin

Turkey first nuclear power station in under developement at Akkuyu, in
the southern province of Mersin near the Mediterranean Sea.

Others have highlighted Ankara's thinly veiled aspirations to
proliferate, but assert Turkey lacks material capabilities and that
claims should be viewed in a domestic context.

For example, former parliamentarian Aykan Erdemir has argued that
"Erdogan has a strong desire to make Turkey into a nuclear power, but
not the capacity," and that the "pro--government media often exaggerate
the strength of the military to increase morale in Turkey".

[Nuclear expert Mark Hibbs cited a deficit of necessary
technology]{.underline} as well as the safeguards put in place by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, which has found no evidence of
clandestine or undeclared nuclear activities during its reporting
processes.

[But]{.underline} while Hibbs's points are strongly made, [his analysis
predated Trump's election. The contrast between the international
political climate of 2015 and the present **is hard to
understate**.]{.underline}

[[In 2018, NATO looks fractured and the Western normative order is
potentially in decline]{.mark}. Russia is revitalised and
assertive.]{.underline}

In the nuclear domain, Iran appears to have engaged with the UN Security
Council\'s five permanent members and Germany and the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action only to be punished, while serial offender
Kim has been rewarded for his determined push towards proliferation.

[[In this context]{.mark}, the proliferation threshold has been lowered
and the oft-discussed nuclear **"[domino effect" becomes more
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The most widely discussed possibility is
a single Middle Eastern state proliferating, and others quickly
following, the most likely candidates being Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE,
Egypt and Turkey.

[The internal characteristics of the Turkish state are also more
conducive to proliferation.]{.underline}

[[President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can effectively rule by decree under
new powers]{.mark} granted after the 2017 referendum and his 2018
re-election. Importantly, **the 2016 coup attempt allowed him to purge
the military** [and]{.mark} defence establishment of dissenting actors
who **[could push back against dramatic strategic
changes.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

When combined, [[the]{.mark} new highly [centralised]{.mark} political
[system, ]{.mark}]{.underline}future [[access to a nuclear fuel cycle,
large investment in delivery mechanisms, and an international system
where proliferation is rewarded make Turkey's emergence as a nuclear
state much more likely]{.mark} than in the past.]{.underline}

Given international security is largely a game of deterrents, it is hard
to picture a strategic environment where Turkey is not considering or
planning the ability to proliferate in the near future if required.

#### Other Nuclear escalation could occur\-\-- Unathorized US nukes, Israeli escalation, etc.

VIPIN **NARANG 18,** Associate Professor of Political Science at MIT,
8/28/18, "How Nations Go Nuclear: An Interview With M.I.T.\'s Vipin
Narang"
http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2018/8/28/vipin-narang-interview

Because Turkey is a NATO ally, it enjoys a formal extended deterrence
guarantee from the United States. In addition[, [we store about 50
B-61s]{.underline}]{.mark} [\[nuclear bombs\] deployed [at
Incirlik]{.mark} in secure vaults, albeit under US control.]{.underline}
Any flirtation with a nuclear weapons program should---according to my
theory---be aimed at eliciting greater assurance from the US or
preparing for abandonment.

[[But Turkey may be sui generis]{.mark} because our relationship is so
fraught and now they are playing footsie with Russia]{.underline}. When
the coup attempt happened last year people worried about the 50 B-61s
stored at Incirlik because there were reports that the base commander
was a Gulenist. [It would be difficult for anyone to access the US
nuclear weapons stored there, but [it is important to remember that the
safety features on these weapons are only designed to "delay"
unauthorized use, not "prevent" it.]{.mark}]{.underline} I don't see any
good reason for us to continue to maintain [[tactical nuclear weapons on
Turkish soil]{.underline}]{.mark} anymore. [They [are increasingly a
**liability**]{.mark}, not an asset.]{.underline}

And my guess is that Turkey may be preparing for the day that withdrawal
occurs. My reading of Turkey is that [[it may already be anticipating a
rupture with the US]{.mark} or NATO [and is]{.mark} therefore [laying
the groundwork to replace the nuclear umbrella]{.mark} the US
provides.]{.underline}

It would be a classic case of \[weapons\] insurance hedging. But it's
not clear what threat there is to Turkey. It's not from Russia, but
maybe they are pricing in a future nuclear Iran, if my theory is right.
But wouldn't surprise me if Turkey abandons the US or vice versa, and
its nuclear efforts put them closer to the Saudi and UAE model.

[[North Korea]{.mark}n President Kim Jong-un [has shown the
blueprint]{.mark}. If you want a meeting with the president of the U.S.,
and insurance against an invasion, then get a nuclear
weapon.]{.underline} Do it secretly. Make it ambiguous.

North Korea has provided the blueprint for a lot of these countries[.
[Build a reactor, pull out of NPT, kick out the
inspectors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last year was the critical moment for
North Korea's weaponization as they tested long range missiles and
higher yield nuclear weapons designs. Once they did so, they declared
that they achieved completion of their deterrent force. And countries
know that the US is very cautious militarily against states with nuclear
weapons. An Indian general in fact remarked that the most important
lesson of the 1991 Gulf War was that no one should ever fight the United
States without a nuclear weapons capability.

[[The most fruitful pathway for Turkey is uranium enrichment]{.mark},
not a reactor, which would have to be under international
safeguards.]{.underline} Uranium enrichment is probably easier to hide,
though perhaps a less efficient pathway. You can try with civilian
reactors. Taiwan had a hole in its spent fuel pool. Syria tried. But
it's much harder.

[[And]{.mark} I would be surprised if the Israelis allow Turkey to have
an operational reactor[. Israel wouldn't attack NATO country. But if
Turkey left NATO all bets would be off.]{.mark}]{.underline} Israeli
policy has essentially been no reactors in the region---it bombed Iraq's
and Syria's. So if history is any guide, Israel won't let anyone in the
region get an operational reactor.

### AT: No Turkey War

#### Normal deterrents towards nuclear war don't apply to Turkey

Adam **Garfinkle 18,** the founding editor of The American Interest,
former editor of the national interest, speechwriter for both of
President George W. Bush\'s Secretaries of State, 9/3/18, "The
U.S.-Turkish Unraveling and the Arabs",
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/09/03/the-u-s-turkish-unraveling-and-the-arabs/

Now, [some observers have argued that nuclear weapons are really not
very important after al]{.underline}l. If the United States and the
Soviet Union, as well as China, France, and the United Kingdom, survived
the Cold War without any nuclear use, it must be because deterrence is
easy and hence stable, since all rational people know that the weapons
are unusable save for the since-become-impossible exception of a state
holding a monopoly over them. One well-known scholar, Kenneth Waltz,
argued persistently that the more nuclear the weapons the
better---because they would sober everyone up and lead to more stability
and fewer wars. [Happily, those with actual government responsibility
did not agree.]{.underline}

[It is unspeakably lazy thinking to glibly superimpose the U.S.-Soviet
Cold War deterrence experience onto places like the Middle
East]{.underline}. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all[, [one thing
to maintain stable deterrence when there are]{.mark} only]{.underline}
two, or [[a small number of, nuclear powers]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.mark} quite [another to maintain stable deterrence when the
number of nuclear actors gets larger]{.mark} and becomes somewhat
open-ended as more states lean that way]{.underline}. Under such
conditions it becomes much more difficult to calculate what a sufficient
deterrent is, and so efforts to make sure of having "enough" can touch
off a multilateral arms competition in which sufficiency becomes an
ever-moving target, almost impossible to hit. [At the same time [it
becomes much more difficult]{.mark} to imagine crisis stability [if one
or more states resort to launch-on-warning deployment postures]{.mark},
which are more likely when young arsenals are small and unprotectable
against preemptive attack.]{.underline}

Other important potential differences between U.S.-Soviet Cold War
deterrence and potential multiparty deterrence in the Middle East exist,
too. Let us note just three.

First, [[U.S. and Soviet arsenals displayed clear lines of
civil-military authority]{.mark} in highly institutionalized state
systems, but many [Middle Eastern countries lack both such clear lines
of authority and highly institutionalized arrangements,]{.mark} being
instead looser and more personalized by nature.]{.underline}

Second[, it was taken for granted that both [U.S. and Soviet leaderships
cared about the safety of their populations]{.mark}, a necessary
assumption for effective deterrence]{.underline}. But [[in some
heterogeneous and authoritarian Middle Eastern countries this premise
may not so surely apply]{.mark}---think both Iraq and Syria under
minoritarian]{.underline} (and coincidentally Ba'athi[) leadership, both
of which committed mass murder against its own citizens.]{.underline}

And third, [[U.S.-Soviet deterrence operations became]{.mark}
inextricably [bound up in the minds of observers with intercontinental
ballistic missile delivery systems.]{.mark} The result is that some
people today think that if missiles can be limited in one way or
another, then the dangers of nuclear weapons, even if they come to
exist, would be much mitigated. This is delusional because it is
technologically obtuse. You need intercontinental ballistic missiles if
you're trying to shoot a warhead across an ocean. [But if your enemy
target is not across an ocean, but]{.mark}, as in the Middle East,
[quite nearby, airplanes are immensely less expensive and more reliable
as delivery systems.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The basic point is that in both theory and practice, [there is little
difference between the proliferation stimulating effects of a Turkish
nuclear weapons breakout and an Iranian one. So if the U.S.-Turkish
strategic partnership unravels, logic does indeed suggest a Turkish
effort to develop its own nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. (Of course,
the same kinds of pressures pertain to other key countries were they to
lose, one way or another, their U.S. nuclear umbrellas, including
Germany, Japan, South Korea, and others.)

If that happens, the Turkish government could probably develop
deliverable nuclear warheads at least on its side of the ocean within
two to three years. If the Iranian government had thought for its own
good reasons to avoid overt testing and breakout postures once the
nuclear deal expires by calendar or "is expired" by volition, a Turkish
bomb would make that posture far more difficult to justify. One could
therefore [[imagine a situation of twinned or near-simultaneous
breakouts of Turkish and Iranian nuclear weapons]{.mark} even a mere
three, four, or five years from now. [The shock to the region would be
profound]{.mark}, and possibly very dangerous.]{.underline}

## Solvency

### Solvency -- End Waivers

#### National interest waiver nulls intent of CSPA

Ursula **Wylan** 12/16/**11**, Master of Arts in International Studies,
University of San Francisco, \"Child Soldiers: Solutions from a
Humanistic Lens\", Master\'s Theses,
https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=thesThe
Child Soldier Prevention Act

The US has attempted to affect the problem of child soldiers through
domestic legislation with international reach. The US Congress enacted
the [Child Soldier Prevention Act **[(CSPA)]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
2008. This legislation, passed by Congress, is [[intended to eliminate
military aid]{.mark} from the US [to governments]{.mark} [who have been
found by]{.mark} the Trafficking in Persons]{.underline} **[[(TIP)
report]{.underline}]{.mark}**, released annually from the State
Department, to have child soldiers fighting in their borders. In the
CSPA there is a clear condemnation of the use of children in armed
conflict and it is the first legislation of its kind in the US[. [There
is also]{.mark} a clause in the CSPA, which provides [for a **national
interest waiver**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This waiver can be applied to
the countries that would be affected by the CSPA and would be ineligible
for US military aid. [This activation of the waiver means those
countries would still receive military aid which in turns funds the very
conflicts in which the child soldiers were found to be fighting
in]{.underline}. This waiver is issued by the President of the United
States and [would be based on US "national interest]{.underline}".
Section 404(c)(1) of the CSPA states: "The President may waive the
application to a country of the prohibition in subsection (a) if the
President determines that such waiver is in the national interest of the
United States. [The message that this waiver sends is: [if a country is
considered a national interest of the US, then the issue of child
soldiers and the elimination of this global problem is **overshadowed**
by what is **solely best for the US**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The first year that the CSPA was set to go into effect was 2010. This
meant that the countries on the TIP report, found to have child soldiers
fighting within its border, would not receive military aid in FY 2011.
Those countries included: Burma, Somalia, Yemen, Chad, Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan. On October 25, 2010 President
Obama made use of his powers under the waiver provision of the CSPA
releasing a Memorandum which waived Sudan, Chad, DRC, and Yemen from the
CSPA (Obama Memorandum, 2010). In summary: the TIP report identified six
countries in total which would then not receive military aid in FY 2011.
[With the **waiver of four countries**, **only two were left**: Somalia
and Burma. Interestingly enough neither of these countries receive US
military aid anyway and so would not be affected by the
CSPA]{.underline} (LaFranchi, 2010). The result of the national interest
waiver is that any meaningful affect that the US may have hoped to have
on the issue of child soldiers, by enacting this legislation, has been
nullified. By waiving these four countries, the conclusion has been
drawn by some that the CSPA is a document which may look good in theory
but is has no effect (Becker, 2010; Fortenberry, 2010; LaFranchi, 2010).
US national interest trumps the rights of children and this is not a
message that should be sent to the rest of the world. [The US should not
be funding governments with military aid when those governments have
been found guilty, based on the US's own State Department Report, of
failing to eliminate child soldiers within those countries
borders.]{.underline}

Human rights in general have been a concern on the forefront of global
politics since World War II. The United Nations has adopted many
resolutions and conventions aimed at protecting the human race as a
whole from the violence and injustice that occurs in times of war as
well as in times of peace. When it comes to the child, human rights have
found a place in protecting this vulnerable population. Many documents
have been created and passed as international laws which aim to enforce
this protection. For instance, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR) was one of the first of its kind to address the rights of the
child. Article 25 of this 1948 document states: (1) Everyone has the
right to a 6 standard of living adequate for the health and well-being
of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and
medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in
the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or
other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. (2)
Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.
All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same
social protection (UDHR, 1948). In 1989 the rights of the child were
revisited with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The CRC
declares: "Considering that the child should be fully prepared to live
an individual life in society, and brought up in the spirit of the
ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, and in
particular in the spirit of peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality
and solidarity (CRC, 1989)." Child soldier involvement in armed conflict
violates the very rights that the global community has tried to protect
for all children. [In order to ensure that a child is free and safe from
participation on any level in the affairs of war, the international
community must make sure that children are protected from participation
in armed conflict.]{.underline} The thought of a child as young an age
as eight years old participating in combat is an appalling notion but it
is precisely what occurred in Sierra Leone's Civil War (Zack-Williams,
2006), in Uganda's conflict with the LRA (Children in War, 2000) and in
Sudan's Civil War (TIP Report, 2010).

[The CSPA is a progressive and important documen]{.underline}t, [but
[the presence of presidential waiv]{.mark}]{.underline}[ers]{.mark} such
as the one issued on October 25, 2010 [[**reverses** this very
progress]{.underline}.]{.mark} When Congress takes the important first
steps by passing the CSPA, implementation is the other half of its
relevance. This progress, which has been documented in the CRC and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and now the CSPA, has an
important place in politics and politicians and policy makers need to
follow through. [[**Voiding these documents** purpose with
waivers]{.mark} is [doing children]{.mark} in these countries an
[injustice]{.mark} [as well as American taxpayers]{.mark} [who]{.mark}
are [fund]{.mark}ing [these governments]{.mark} with military aid rather
than that money being used for more positive issues domestically or
abroad. T]{.underline}hese four countries: DRC, Yemen, Chad and Sudan
have been found to have child soldiers fighting within their borders and
so US taxpayer money should not be supplied to those governments.
Military aid will supply the funds needed to continue the conflicts that
children are a part of[. [The pragmatism of r**ealpolitik** has made
national interest more important than protecting children
globally]{.underline}]{.mark} and in this paper I will demonstrate why
[this needs to be corrected.]{.underline} Children should not be
fighting in wars which adults decide to wage and the US should not be
funding the continuance of those wars.

The US created legislation with the intention of contributing to the
elimination of the global problem of child soldiers. [The CSPA is the
tool that encompasses this contribution and as discussed would prevent
US military aid from being a resource to governments where the problem
of child soldiers exists within the borders of that governments
territory]{.underline}. The Child Soldier Prevention Act, which provides
the US with a way to affect this problem, must be allowed to have the
intended effect. [[The waiver of countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
the act is meant to hold accountable, [[has **nullified** any this very
effect which the US hoped to have when passing the
legislation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While governments have come to a consensus that child soldiers are a
problem, not all of them are currently working to eliminate the problem.
With the waiver of Sudan, DRC, Chad and Yemen, the only four countries
found on the TIP report who receive US military aid, in practice there
is no actual progress on the effect that the CSPA was meant to have.
From my research I argue that [this disconnect between policy and
implementation can be outlined in regards to child soldiers not only in
the US but in all legislation regarding child soldiers, and hopefully
this can lead to better enforcement of such policy documents as the
CSPA.]{.underline}

#### Removing the national interest waiver key to plan enforcement (Tyler Kinzy)

Ursula **Wylan 11**, Master of Arts in International Studies, University
of San Francisco, 12/16/11, "Child Soldiers: Solutions from a Humanistic
Lens," Master\'s Theses,
https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=thesThe
Child Soldier Prevention Act

[There is a responsibility of countries with leverage, such as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [to make the elimination of
this]{.underline} global [problem a priority]{.underline}. What I
advocate for is not a unilateral approach by the US where it goes in
guns blazing and forces a country to yield to its wishes. Instead, I
recommend a cosmopolitan approach, in tandem with other countries who
have agreed through international law that child soldiers are a problem
that need to be eliminated. This approach means not supporting countries
who are not complying with international agreements/law that say child
soldiers under the age of eighteen years old should be actively
recruited, let alone abducted, into armed forces of a state or a rebel
group. [This means not providing]{.underline} economic or [military
assistance to guilty countries]{.underline}. [[The CSPA]{.mark} is an
excellent first step and [should be taken further with the **elimination
of a presidential waiver**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the addition of a
clause [[which would prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[support of
guilty countries]{.underline}]{.mark} as well [and most
importantly]{.underline}, the [actual enforcement]{.underline} of the
document. The TIP report is the US's own metric for whether countries
are trafficking humans within their borders. If the purpose of this
report is to aid in the elimination of human trafficking, then its
findings need to be examined and action taken to affect change. The fact
that the TIP report lays out a detailed explanation of the cases of
child soldiering in countries in which the US provides aid, shows that
the CSPA is the precise tool for affecting change through the leverage
the US has in its relations with those countries. If military aid is
part of that relationship, it 62 should be revoked until the military
affairs within the borders of said country do not include the
recruitment or abduction of children into the ranks of the State Armed
Force, or the rebel groups vying for power. If the TIP report has found
that children are being recruited or abducted to fight in the borders of
a country, clearly that country has not done its job in preventing this
modern day form of child abuse from occurring.

I also recommend that legislation like the CSPA be adopted in other
countries that have economic or military relations with countries who
have children fighting in their conflicts. As mentioned before this is
not a unilateral US interest, it is a global one that must be enforced
through international law, domestic law, political relations, military
relations and understood by the global citizenry as a whole. With
multiple ways of attacking this problem, including the prevention of an
environment in a country which would provide the climate for rebel
groups to gain so much power as to be able to destroy a generation as
was done in El Salvador in its civil war in the 1980's, Sierra Leone in
the 1990's and Uganda and Sudan up to present day.

This problem does not belong to one culture, to one continent, or to one
point in time. Neither will the elimination of the problem. It will take
the entire international community and time to make a world without
child soldiers a reality. 63

Conclusion

This thesis project has examined the problem of child soldiers by
examining existing research, describing specific case studies of three
conflicts in which child soldiers were present, and by looking at
international and domestic law aimed at the elimination of the problem.
From the data presented here the important takeaways are: that the
current [[mechanisms for preventing the use of child
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} around the globe [[are only as strong as
the enforcement]{.mark} behind them]{.underline}. It is not enough to
put laws and conventions to a vote at the UN or to discuss these
problems in a white paper. The real key to eliminating this problem is
for countries with bargaining power, such as the US to use that power to
keep military aid from continuing the violence in countries where the
conflict employs children. [Tools such as [the CSPA can be made relevant
but the waiver]{.mark} of countries which are meant to be
affected]{.underline} is something that [[has to be
avoided]{.underline}]{.mark} and the country in question must address
the issue of child soldiers in their borders. It is not enough to say it
on paper; [it has to be enforced in practice]{.underline}.

The prevalence of child soldiers around the globe is a disturbing fact
that is the entire international community's responsibility to correct.
This problem is not one that can be traced to one group, one conflict,
one government, one country, nor one continent. The very fact that this
is problem which spills over borders, affects entire communities and
destroys the lives of as many as the 300,000 children estimated to be
fighting around the globe at any given time, shows how important this
problem is for the global citizenry. All countries must do their part 64
to ensure the end of this problem. Legislation such as the CSPA are
necessary first steps but the next one has to be legitimization of such
legislation and most importantly: enforcement. [[Without
these]{.underline}]{.mark} additional [[facets]{.underline}]{.mark} of
any international or domestic law, [there is no substance]{.underline}
to them [and]{.underline} thus **[[the intended effect is
lost]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Lastly, it is imperative that this issue be given more attention. In the
course of writing this paper I found one too many people I spoke with
about my research clueless to the problem of child soldiers. This is not
a temporary or fleeting problem. The issue of stolen innocence in the
form of child soldiers needs attention. As global citizens, no matter
what country you pledge allegiance, elimination of this problem should
be a goal.

#### Current waviers serve as loopholes for arm sales with Afghanistan who was verified using child soldiers 

Charu Lata **Hogg** 3/31/**16**, policy and advocacy director at Child
Soldiers International, \"The Loophole that Allows the US to Fund Child
Soldiers\", Newsweek,
https://www.newsweek.com/loophole-allows-us-fund-child-soldiers-442393

The Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (CSPA) should be fairly
straightforward: the law bans the United States from providing military
assistance or arms sales to governments that use children in combat.
Simply put, if a country's government uses child soldiers, it cannot
receive military support from the United States. Except several
countries that use child soldiers do. This is because of a loophole in
the child soldiers ban called a "**[[national interest
waiver]{.underline}]{.mark}**," which [[allows the president to **bypass
the law**]{.mark}]{.underline} if it is deemed in the U.S. national
interest to do so. For the past five years, the State Department has
compiled an annual list of governments known to recruit and use children
as soldiers called the Trafficking in Persons (TIPS) list. Yet countries
on this list have been denied only a smattering of military support---in
many cases, [[**military arms and assistance** were provided to
countries identified by the United States as using child
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, last year full [waivers
were granted to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and
Somalia]{.underline}. South Sudan received a partial waiver. And while
Yemen did not receive a waiver, the president granted the secretary of
state the authority to resume military support should he deem it
necessary. [All of these countries are guilty of putting children in
combat.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [[Afghanistan **did not even make the
TIPS** ]{.mark}(trafficking in persons list) [list, even though that
country uses child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Afghan
Local Police (ALP) and Afghan National Police (ANP) have both been
listed in the [UN's annual report on children and armed
conflict](https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/press-release/human-rights-council-report-2016/)
as recruiting and using children for more than five consecutive years.
[[This highlights a **blind spot** in the U.S.]{.mark} government's
[policy.]{.mark}]{.underline} In complex conflicts like [Afghanistan's,
children]{.underline} are often more likely to be recruited and used [by
the police]{.underline} than by the military, because in these countries
recruitment is typically more localized. Yet [[the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} State Department [[maintains that]{.mark} the
[ALP]{.mark}]{.underline} and ANP [[do not]{.underline}]{.mark} legally
[[fall under the rubric of the Child Soldiers Prevention
Act]{.underline}]{.mark}, since they are police and not armed forces. At
Child Soldiers International, we find this to be a tendentious argument.
By the U.S. government's own admission, the ANP and ALP are deployed as
counterinsurgency forces. Moreover, excluding the recruitment and use of
children by Afghan police forces from the CSPA listing mechanism is
inconsistent with international humanitarian and human rights laws. The
U.S. government's failure to apply the CSPA uniformly and consistently
detracts from its commitment to protect the rights of children globally.
Ultimately, no amount of "national interest" should stand in the way of
pressuring abusive governments to end grave violations against children,
including war crimes. By not listing all forces that egregiously violate
children's rights, the United States is sending a message that abuse can
be justified under certain circumstances. Surely, this can't be right.

#### Current [status quo]{.underline} interpretations of the CSPA get [circumvented]{.underline}\-\--Presidential [waivers]{.underline} find [loopholes]{.underline}\-\--Congress [amending]{.underline} it is [key]{.underline} to enforcing it

[[Despite]{.mark} clear [Congressional]{.mark}
[intent]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the CSPA would prevent our government
from funding militaries that recruit child soldiers]{.underline}, [[a
presidential loophole]{.mark} [renders]{.mark} [the CSPA

[of the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. \"13
[Due to [this]{.mark} [waiver]{.mark}]{.underline}, numerous
[[countries]{.mark} [known to recruit child
soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[continued to
receive]{.underline}]{.mark} full or partial
[[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} for the past two years.14 Another
provision allows reinstatement of assistance if the country makes
changes to comply with the CSPA\'s terms (including signing an action
plan and demobilizing child soldiers).15 Of the six countries identified
by the State Department as having recruited child soldiers,16 four have
received waivers or reinstatement of assistance.17 [The]{.underline}
language of the [CSPA is short and vague]{.underline}, [making it nearly
impossible for the President to implement]{.underline} its [provisions
according to Congress\'s intent]{.underline}. [[If Congress wants the
Act to help]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} war-tom countries from
[[recruiting child soldiers, **the Act must be

### Solvency -- CSPA Good

#### CSPA restrictions [end recruitment]{.underline}\-\--empirics from the Obama administration prove

Jo **Becker and** Rachel **Stohl**, 9-28-20**15**, Child soldiers: Time
for U.S. to act (Opinion), CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/28/opinions/becker-stohl-child-soldiers-military-aid/index.html

When the extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
abducts boys from Friday prayers at mosques or indoctrinates children as
young as 10 to become fighters or suicide bombers, there is little the
United States can do. But [[when recipients of U.S.]{.mark} [military
aid recruit children]{.mark} into their forces as soldiers, [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has **a lot of
leverage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is disappointing that the Obama
administration has been reluctant to use it. This week, U.S. President
Barack Obama is expected to make his annual announcement about the
issue, on whether he will waive sanctions on military foreign aid under
U.S. law for any of the eight governments currently on the State
Department\'s list for using child soldiers. [In 14 countries around the
world, according to the United Nations, children are recruited and used
in armed conflicts as informants, guards, porters, cooks, and often, as
front-line armed combatants. In some, only non-state armed groups are
responsible for the practice, but in others, the perpetrators are rebel
forces and governments alike.]{.underline} In South Sudan, child
recruitment spiked sharply last year, with estimates that 12,000
children were fighting with both government and non-state armed groups.
In Yemen, where UNICEF has estimated that one-third of all fighters are
under 18, all sides to the ongoing conflict, including the government,
use child soldiers. Yet [both governments have received millions of
dollars in U.S. military assistance. In 2008, [Congress enacted]{.mark}
a law based on two simple ideas: first, that U.S. tax dollars should not
support the use of child soldiers, and second, that **suspending U.S.
military assistance could be a powerful incentive** to prompt
governments to end this reprehensible practice.]{.underline} The law,
[[the **C**]{.mark}hild **[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention
**[A]{.mark}**ct, took effect in 2010, [restricting]{.mark} U.S.
military [support to governments using children]{.mark} in their armed
forces.]{.underline} But the Obama administration\'s implementation of
the law has fallen far short of the law\'s goals. Our analysis found
that during the five years the law has been in effect, [President Obama
has invoked \"national interest\" waivers to authorize nearly \$1
billion in military assistance and arms sales for countries that are
still using child soldiers. In contrast, we found that only \$35 million
in military assistance and arms sales \-- a mere 4% of what was
sanctionable under the law \-- was actually withheld from these abusive
governments.]{.underline} True, [[the administration achieved]{.mark}
**real [success]{.mark}** [in some instances]{.mark} in which it used
the law]{.underline}. [[In 2012]{.mark}, for example, [it announced it
would withhold]{.mark} military [financing from the]{.mark} Democratic
Republic of [Congo]{.mark} and training from a Congolese battalion
[until Congo signed a]{.mark}n action [plan]{.mark} with the United
Nations [to end]{.mark} its [use of child soldiers]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Congo **had been dragging**]{.mark} **its feet [for seven
years]{.mark}** on signing the plan, [but agreed]{.mark} to its terms
**[only five days after]{.mark}** the [U.S.
announcement]{.mark}]{.underline}. The administration maintained partial
sanctions in 2013 and 2014 to pressure Congo to implement the plan.
[[Last year, the **U**]{.mark}nited **[N]{.mark}**ations [documented
**only two cases of child recruitment** by Congo]{.mark}\'s national
army \-- a significant change]{.underline}. [The administration also
used the threat of military sanctions under the law to press Chad to end
its use of child soldiers. **No new cases of child recruitment** by
Chadian forces have been reported for over two years]{.underline}. In
other cases, however, the administration has used the law ineffectually
or not at all. In Somalia, both the government and Islamist armed group
Al Shabab use children in their forces. Last year, the United Nations
verified nearly 200 cases of child recruitment by the Somali National
Army and allied militia, noting that the actual number is probably much
higher. Yet the administration has authorized more than \$315 million in
military assistance over the past five years \-- assistance that could
have been withheld under the law. And last year, the administration gave
Somalia a full waiver. In Yemen, where children have been recruited by
all sides and the government has done little to address the problem, the
administration has given full waivers every year, providing the
government with more than \$250 million in military assistance and more
than \$57 million in arms sales over the past five years. For the coming
year, the administration has requested over \$25 million more[. To be
sure, the administration has legitimate national interests at stake and
regards some of these countries as critical partners in countering
terrorism. But [ending the use of child soldiers and maintaining]{.mark}
critical [military alliances are **not mutually exclusive**]{.mark}
goals]{.underline}. [[In Congo, **withholding**]{.mark} **just [a
portion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} authorized [assistance was enough]{.mark}
to prompt significant action]{.underline}. In too many cases, however,
the United States provides military assistance to governments using
child soldiers with no strings attached. The last five years suggest
that President Obama too easily gives these governments a pass[. [The
**C**]{.mark}hild **[S]{.mark}**oldiers **[P]{.mark}**revention
**[A]{.mark}**ct [gives]{.mark} him [a **powerful tool** to let
U.S.]{.mark} military [aid recipients know]{.mark} that the [use of
child soldiers is unacceptable]{.mark}. He should use it.]{.underline}

#### Child soldiers have become commonplace in irregular armies around the world because the international community hasn't done a good enough job criminalizing the activity\-\--while there are a disparate range of factors that cause children to become soldiers, there are two specific developments that have led to the growth of child soldiering: the proliferation of arms, and the lack of consequences countries face for allowing the use of child soldiers to spread

College of Law in London. "Destroying Childhood." Harvard Magazine, 1
Sept. 2005, harvardmagazine.com/2005/09/destroying-childhood.html.

[**[A child has been killed in war every three minutes during the last
decade]{.underline}**. [Many were not civilians. Irregular armies from
Sudan to the Philippines, from Turkey to Colombia, from Kosovo to Iraq
use child soldiers]{.underline}. **[They are]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
shock troops, [the **cannon fodder**, often drugged]{.mark} or drunk [on
the battlefield, **brutalized to commit**]{.mark} the most [**heinous
atrocities and sustain** the **highest casualties**]{.mark}. On a
massive scale**, [children are both victims and agents of war]{.mark}**,
roles that violate long]{.underline}-held and fundamental taboos.

**[[This new reality requires us to question any simpleminded notion we
may have of childhood innocence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** What do we make
of children who are brutal and coldblooded killers? Are they mere tools
of coercive adult commanders? Or responsible agents enacting rational
choices? How should regular armies react when they encounter children in
the thick of combat? And what, if anything, can our society do about it?
These urgent questions animate the readable and passionate Children at
War, by Peter Singer, Ph.D. '01.

Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author as
well of *Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military
Industry[, ]{.underline}*[takes as his starting point that [child
soldiering has become a new standard in contemporary warfare]{.mark},
rather than an exception]{.underline}. Boys and girls, often as young as
10, are recruited to fight and be army sex slaves on every inhabited
continent. [[The phenomenon]{.mark}, he argues, [is]{.mark} much more
[pervasive and troubling]{.mark} than has been
acknowledged.]{.underline}

His central claim is that the exploitation of child soldiers is changing
the nature of contemporary war. It is not merely a question of ethics,
or even of numbers, though the latter are alarming---there are about
300,000 child soldiers by current estimates, just under one in 10 of all
present combatants. Rather it is the broader impact of the child-soldier
phenomenon on contemporary politics that is radically underestimated.
[[The abundance of child soldiers makes war cheaper and easier to
initiate, less logistically burdensome to prolong, and more likely to
recur---it creates]{.mark}, in short, **[a pervasive security
threat]{.mark}. [A whole generation whose childhoods have been
destroyed]{.mark}** **[are growing up with only one usable
skill---warfare]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the words of a 19-year-old
Mozambiquan: "There is no work for me. I have few skills except using a
gun and it's easy money... I used to be FRELIMO \[the government army\],
then joined RENAMO \[the rebel army\], then joined FRELIMO. Now I work
for myself and my group."

This tragedy has already had a direct impact on our societies. Child
soldiers are fighting in every conflict zone where U.S. forces are
engaged. Six current Guantánamo Bay detainees were arrested as child
soldiers. The first American soldier killed in the "war on terrorism" in
Afghanistan was shot by a 14-year-old sniper. The same week that
President Bush delivered his "Mission Accomplished" speech aboard an
aircraft carrier, U.S. marines were fired on by an AK-47-wielding
12-year-old Iraqi boy.

[Despite this reality, [the]{.mark} [ethical]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark} [dilemmas]{.mark} surrounding child soldiers
[have]{.mark} [scarcely]{.mark} [been]{.mark}
[discussed]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Should professional soldiers treat
armed children like any other opponents and go for all-out victory, or
attempt to minimize casualties]{.underline}? Five years ago this dilemma
confronted some British peacekeepers in Sierra Leone. The squad
commander was unwilling to fire when his troops were surrounded by a
rogue children's militia known as the "West Side Boys"---"children armed
with AK-47s," as the commander saw it---so the peacekeepers were taken
hostage. Two weeks later, when a British rescue operation freed the
soldiers, up to 150 of the enemy children died, perhaps more than if the
squad commander had not hesitated initially. As Singer rightly comments,
["\[T\]he core dilemma child soldiers present for professional
militaries is as thorny as they come. Troops now face real and serious
threats from opponents whom they generally would prefer not to harm."
What's more, battling children is even worse than ordinary warfare in
terms of serious psychological after-effects, including depression and
post traumatic stress disorder.]{.underline}

Singer argues that [[there is a "child soldier doctrine" at work,
lowering taboos and spreading from country to country.]{.mark} But [are
there]{.mark} instead [a disparate range of
factors?]{.mark}]{.underline} Take the question of recruitment.
According to Singer, [[brute force]{.mark} is "a primary method" of
[recruitment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly it characterizes some of
the best-documented situations. A 14-year-old explains, "I was nine
years old. Six rebels came through our yard.... They said: 'We want to
bring a small boy like you---we like you.' My mother didn't comment; she
just cried. My father objected.... They argued with him at the back of
the house. I heard a gunshot. One of them told me, 'Let's go, we've
killed your father.' A woman rebel grabbed my hand roughly and took me
along. I saw my father lying dead as we passed." The Tamil Tigers in Sri
Lanka routinely use abduction to reach their conscription targets (up to
60 percent of their forces are recruited between the ages of 10 and 16).
[In Uganda, only 200 of the 14,000 active members of the Lords
Resistance Army (LRA) are trained adult soldiers; the rest of this rebel
force, responsible for 10 years of civil war and more than 100,000
casualties, are coerced child soldiers.]{.underline}

But [a second]{.underline}, quite different, [phenomenon is the
[revolutionary zeal]{.mark} that propels disenfranchised children to
volunteer themselves, often to avenge their humiliated or decimated
communities]{.underline}: "My father, mother, and brothers were killed
by the enemy. I became angry....And to revenge is only to have a gun....
That is the decision I took to become a soldier." Sixty percent of
children serving in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the
infamous FARC) are volunteers. So are 57 percent of child soldiers in
East Asia, according to UNICEF data. The percentages of teen-agers
voluntarily engaged in the "war on terror" are higher. In these cases,
children's involvement in armed combat is an expression of individual
agency and political engagement. Given Singer's own claim that "roughly
two of every three child soldiers have some sort of initiative in their
own recruitment," how can forced recruitment be the primary method of
enlisting children?

[There are other explanations, too, including [economic
necessity]{.mark}]{.underline}. A third of all children in Africa suffer
severe hunger. To quote a 12-year-old: "I don't know where my mother and
father are. I had nothing to eat. I joined the gunmen to get food.... I
was with the other fighters for eight months. There was nothing good
about that life."

Finally, there is the phenomenon that anthropologist William Murphy
calls ["[patrimonialism]{.mark}," a form of affiliation that ties
vulnerable children to unrelated but powerful and domineering adults
within their communities---a response to the pervasive "protection
vacuum" that afflicts so many thousands of orphaned, displaced, or
otherwise dispossessed children.]{.underline} AIDS complicates this
picture: as elders able to mentor rootless youth are decimated, children
attach themselves to adults capable of ordering their universe, however
brutally.

[Singer may thus be [wrong to focus on a unitary "child soldier
doctrine."]{.mark} He is [right]{.mark}, however, [to argue that]{.mark}
several very [specific developments]{.mark} have [contributed to the
growth of child soldiering]{.mark} as an effective global weapons
platform today. The [proliferation of small arms is
critical]{.mark}]{.underline}---cheap, light, and simple weapons which
are as child-friendly to use as they are deadly to encounter.
Chillingly, he points out that in Sudan an AK-47 costs the same as a
chicken, in northern Kenya the same as a goat. Small arms represent less
than 2 percent of the cost of the global-arms trade, but are responsible
for about 90 percent of contemporary war casualties. Recruiters
measuring children to see whether they are tall and strong enough to
carry arms have an ever-easier time finding qualifying candidates as the
weapons get smaller and lighter.

[This practical development [dovetails with an equally crucial political
factor: whatever the moral stigma of using child soldiers, the political
and legal consequences are negligible.]{.mark}]{.underline} Recruiting
child soldiers is no longer taboo. [The Tamil Tigers, for example, have
set up a computerized system for managing child recruitment and
established a military unit consisting entirely of child orphans, yet
the organization has been included in peace talks about the future of
Sri Lanka without prior confirmation that it has ended its recruitment
of children.]{.underline}

[There is also the question of utility. Because of the terrifying
milieus from which many child recruits are drawn and the brutal,
brainwashing military induction techniques,]{.underline} children [turn
out to be devastatingly useful soldiers]{.underline}, "damn near as good
as conscript-drafted Americans or Europeans in the use of NATO tactics,"
a retired Green Beret officer told Singer. Cheap, plentiful, and
effective: it is hardly surprising that the numbers of child recruits
appear to be rising.

[Explaining the reasons for child soldiering, however, is much easier
than suggesting effective solutions]{.underline}. So far, [[the greatest
strides in addressing the problem have been made in the legal sphere,
**which does not require radical economic or political
restructuring.**]{.underline} [We now have]{.underline}]{.mark} [a host
of [international conventions]{.mark}]{.underline}---on the laws of war,
on the worst forms of child labor, on children's rights---[[which
explicitly focus on eliminating the use of child
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}. In February 2002, a new Optional Protocol
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the Involvement of
Children in Armed Conflict, came into force. It prohibits signatory
states from compulsorily recruiting under-18-year-olds, and requires
them to do whatever they can to keep volunteers under 18 from deployment
in active combat. Eighty-five countries, including the United States,
have ratified this instrument. In another significant development, the
statute of the newly established International Criminal Court (ICC)
makes recruitment or use of children under 15 for warfare a war crime
punishable by the court.

[The progress goes beyond getting laws on the books]{.underline}. The UN
Security Council now sets aside a day each year to discuss the issue of
child soldiers, naming and proposing sanctions against countries that
use them and instituting monitoring systems to track the circumstances
of children involved in armed conflicts. The ICC, as part of its first
investigations, has chosen two conflicts that include massive
children's-rights violations: the LRA-led conflict in northern Uganda
and the current war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Child
recruiters in these two conflicts may well be the first to be
prosecuted. Domestic legislation is also being passed, with tribunals in
individual countries providing additional means of prosecuting child
recruiters. In Sierra Leone, for example, the prosecutor for the special
court set up to prosecute war criminals after the recent civil war has
said, "If you go after women and children, you will pay the price."
These encouraging and important steps establish clear international
standards and provide leaders with tools for enforcing sanctions and
criminal penalties.

[[But the tragic reality is that no one has yet been convicted of
recruiting child soldiers,]{.mark} or stopped from traveling or using a
Swiss bank account because of this violation of international
law]{.underline}. What use is naming and shaming if (as the Tamil Tigers
and the LRA have done) the targets blatantly lie and are indifferent to
international censure?

[**[Without effective criminalization, the split between]{.mark} verbal
[denunciation of child soldiering and de facto support]{.mark}** of the
practice **[is likely to continue. Weapons sales]{.mark}** and
unmonitored aid **and trade [are a critical part of the problem. The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**, Singer notes**, [sends a
quarter-billion dollars' worth of military equipment]{.mark}** and
training assistance [per year **to states that use child
soldiers**]{.mark}, such as Colombia and Rwanda. As he points out**,
[stigmatizing and criminalizing commercial transactions with offending
states is more likely to be effective than]{.mark}** yet more
**[international norm setting. But this is just another example of a
broader problem: the familiar reluctance of powerful states to use their
political capital to resolve humanitarian issues that don't impinge on
their immediate self-interest]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### The use of child soldiers contributes to the rise in civil wars, ethnic violence, and genocide around the world\-\--US arms flow to dangerous groups who kill innocent people

EM: The [United Nations recently alleged that [ethnic cleansing]{.mark}
was [unfolding in South Sudan.]{.mark} The president, Salva
[Kiir]{.mark}, [denied]{.mark} these [allegations]{.mark}. Tens, maybe
hundreds of [thousands of people have died]{.mark} --- nobody knows the
exact number.]{.underline} Can you describe the country's history for
readers who know little about the conflict, and talk about the current
situation?

NT: South Sudan is the youngest nation on earth. Its independence day
was in July 2011. The [South Sudanese won their independence
through]{.underline} very [long, bloody struggles]{.underline} with the
north of the country, today Sudan, that went back into the 1950s. But
[the United States played a significant part.]{.underline} There was a
real [bipartisan push in Washington.]{.underline}

EM: We "midwifed" it.

NT: Yeah. "Midwife" is the word that John Kerry used when he was in the
Senate. Clinton used the term as well when she was secretary of state.
It's indelicate to some degree, but there's a lot of truth to it. The
[United States put a lot of time, effort, and money into creating South
Sudan.]{.underline} But by [December of [2013]{.mark}, it had slid into
a [civil war]{.mark}, an exceptionally brutal war.]{.underline}

I travelled there in 2014, just after the war began, in 2015 again, and
then earlier this year. [It's [gotten progressively worse.]{.mark} The
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations Special Envoy [mentioned the
possibility of **genocide, a Rwanda-type
situation.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is what people were telling me even in 2015, when I did the
reporting for my book. A lot of times people would whisper the word
"Rwanda" to me, saying that that was their great fear. Looking at it
from afar, this is what I really fear today. We're right at the
precipice now.

I spent several weeks earlier this year in [[a town called
Leer]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[could be a model for the bloodletting
to come.]{.mark} This was a wasteland. [The]{.mark} entire [town was
razed to the ground.]{.mark}]{.underline} I walked through [[a
field]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[was strewn with human remains, skulls,
rib cages, femurs, spinal columns.]{.mark} It was a horrorscape. People
there were too afraid to even bury their dead.]{.underline}

[**[This is starting to happen in other areas]{.mark} of the country as
well**; areas that for the last couple of years have been untouched by
war. But [it's spreading.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We're seeing [[ethnic killings, machete killings, village
burnings.]{.mark} It's looking exceedingly grim.]{.underline} I'm
actually right now looking for an outlet to send me back, because there
are stories that need to be told there.

Sudanese reporters who do this type of work --- it's a very dangerous
environment for them. [[Reporters are threatened. They're kidnapped and
beaten. Some are killed. **No one has been held accountable** for these
beatings, abductions, killings.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's open season on
reporters there.

It's a sad situation, and it's been one. I have a tough time
understanding what the [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration's
modus operandi was with South Sudan. It [[resisted]{.mark}, for years,
[imposing an arms embargo on the country]{.mark} --- something that
seemed to be a no-brainer.]{.underline}

EM: And there is a child soldier piece as well, right?

NT: [[Under]{.mark} the [C]{.mark}hild [S]{.mark}oldier
[P]{.mark}rotection [A]{.mark}ct, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[isn't allowed to give aid to countries that have children under

[This was]{.mark} all [done with]{.mark} the [thinking]{.mark} that
[somehow]{.mark} then [we'd have more leverage]{.mark} over them[. But
instead they kept their child soldiers, kept importing arms, and kept
killing their own people.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the last couple of weeks [the United States pushed for an actual arms
embargo, but no one in the international community wanted to sign on to
it. So it crashed and burned at the United Nations. When the threat of
an arms embargo disappeared, so did any kind of leverage. The Kiir
government now has a free hand.]{.underline}

EM: [Why]{.underline} has the [United States been so involved in South
Sudan?]{.underline} What does the Obama administration view as American
interests in South Sudan?

NT: I wish I had an answer for you. I tried asking State Department
representatives, went to the National Security Council at the White
House and tried asking these same questions, and it was [always an
incoherent answer.]{.underline} I could never quite make heads or tails
of it.

[They were always talking about leverage]{.underline}, that they didn't
want to foreclose the possibility. [[They thought engagement was better
than cutting South Sudan off.]{.mark} [But]{.mark} you have
[people]{.mark} that [are dying at the hands of a government.]{.mark}

[At some point you have to say]{.underline}, "This idea of [[leverage

playing some sort of long game that seems to have gotten away from
them.]{.underline}

#### Child soldiers face a [multitude of physical and psychological]{.underline} impacts\-\--including [disease, PTSD, depression, dissociation, and lack of education]{.underline}

The [Impact of Trauma on the Body [Beyond psychological
suffering]{.mark} from the symptoms of PTSD]{.underline}, traumatized
populations show significantly [elevated levels of physical morbidity
and mortality.]{.underline} As outlined above, in recent years, evidence
has mounted that severe anxiety states [-- [stress]{.mark} at a
traumatic level -- [lead to]{.mark} a functional and structural
**[alteration of the brain]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Eckart et al.,
submitted; Kolassa & Elbert, 2007). The [co-occurrence of several
pathogenic processes includes a permanent alteration of bodily
processes, due to a state of persistent readiness for an alarm
response.]{.underline} Psychobiological abnormalities in PTSD are
observed as psychophysiological, neurohormonal, neuroanatomical, and
immunological effects (Boscarino, 2004; Kolassa et al., 2007; Neuner et
al., 2008; Schnurr & Jankowski, 1999). [Trauma survivors, including
child soldiers, frequently report **[high rates of physical
illness]{.mark}**, involving a variety of physiological
systems]{.underline}. In a recent study (Sommershof et al., 2009), we
observed a [substantial and clinically relevant [change in immune
function]{.mark}, based on a 34% reduction of naïve and a 54% reduction
of regulatory T cells following war and torture related
PTSD]{.underline}. Thus, there [seems to be a positive correlation not
just between developed psychiatric illnesses and prior trauma, but also
[a significant relationship between]{.mark} the amount of [traumatic
exposure and **poor**]{.mark} **physical [health]{.mark}** outcomes. An
emerging body of literature is successfully exploring the relationship
between trauma-spectrum disorders, foremost PTSD and increased somatic
complaints, such as [**cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and
gastrointestinal** complaints]{.mark}; various types of somatic
pain;]{.underline} susceptibility to infectious diseases; [vulnerability
to hypertension and atherosclerotic heart disease; abnormalities in
thyroid and other hormone function; [increased **risk of
cancer**]{.mark} and susceptibility to [infections and autoimmune
disorders;]{.mark} and problems with pain perception, pain tolerance,
and **[chronic pain]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Altemus, Dhabhar, & Yang,
2006; Boscarino, 2004; Dyregrov & Yule, 2006; Elbert et al., 2009;
Escalona, Achilles, Waitzkin, & Yager, 2004; Ford et al., 2001; Ironson
et al., 1997; Joshi & O'Donnell, 2003; Karunakara et al., 2004; Kessler,
2000; McEwen, 2000; Neuner et al., 2008; S. J. Roberts, 1996; Rohleder &
Karl, 2006; Schnurr & Jankowski, 1999; Seng, Graham-Bermann, Clark,
McCarthy, & Ronis, 2005; Somasundaram, 2001; van der Veer, Somasundaram,
& Damian, 2003). It is important to keep in mind that in
post-disaster/conflict regions, children and their parents, who remain
in the area or are forced to migrate (asylum seekers, refugees, IDPs),
have not only survived an unusual number and types of traumatic
stressors, but also had to endure poverty related or other social
stressors and adversities, such as domestic violence, family separation,
and child labor (Catani et al., 2008; Catani et al., 2009). [Child
[soldiering]{.mark} additionally [contributes to]{.mark} the already
**heightened [stress load]{.mark}** due to adversity]{.underline}.
Taking into account the absence of health services in this context, high
child, adolescent, and adult mortality, epidemic rates of disease
transmission, as well as low life expectancy rates in many of today's
(post-)conflict settings come as no surprise (AACAP, 1998; Dyregrov &
Yule, 2006; Ehntholt & Yule, 2006; Elbert et al., 2009; Karunakara et
al., 2004; Miranda & Patel, 2005; Neuner et al., 2008; Neuner, Schauer,
Catani, Ruf, & Elbert, 2006; Odenwald et al., 2007). 332 E. Schauer and
T. Elbert Further Psychological Consequences of Trauma Exposure [There
are a multitude of further psychological consequences of experiencing
traumatic life-threat. In sum, the [response to]{.mark} war-related
[trauma]{.mark} by ex-combatants and former child soldiers in countries
directly affected by war and violence [is complex and renders]{.mark}
the [survivors vulnerable]{.mark} to various forms of **psychological
disorders**, whereby stressors may have a different impact during
different developmental periods]{.underline}. [[During childhood]{.mark}
and adolescence, the mind and brain are particularly plastic and hence,
[stress has]{.mark} a great [potential to affect]{.mark} **cognitive and
affective [development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Exposure to significant
stressors during sensitive developmental periods causes the [brain to
develop along a stress-responsive pathway.]{.underline} As a
consequence, the brain and mind become organized in a way to facilitate
survival in a world of deprivation and danger, enhancing an individual's
capacity to rapidly and dramatically shift into an intense angry,
aggressive, or fearful fleeing/avoiding state when threatened. This
pathway, however, is costly because it is associated with increased risk
of developing serious medical and psychiatric disorders, like the
aforementioned PTSD, and is unnecessary and non-adaptive in peaceful
environments (Elbert et al., 2006; Teicher, Andersen, Polcari, Anderson,
& Navalta, 2002). Chronic danger or exposure to extreme stress requires
costly developmental adjustment in children. Though the core symptoms of
PTSD are the most extensively studied psychological consequences of war,
they are clearly not the only ones. In addition to associated features
like survivor's guilt or shame and changes in personality, survivors may
also suffer from substance-use disorders, affective disorders, including
major depression, suicidal ideation, and various forms of anxiety
disorders (Bichescu et al., 2005; Boscarino, 2004, 2006; Catani et al.,
2009; Johnson & Thompson, 2008; Keane & Kaloupek, 1997; Lapierre,
Schwegler, & Labauve, 2007; Odenwald et al., 2007; Schauer, 2008).
Surviving traumatic experiences might be followed by social withdrawal,
loss of trust, major changes in patterns of behaviour or ideological
interpretations of the world, and feelings of guilt and shame
(Dickson-Gomez, 2002; Janoff-Bulman, 1992). Drug Abuse Parallel to the
trafficking of light weapons, the global commerce of illicit
pharmacological stimuli served as an effective catalyst of war. (Maclure
& Denov, 2006), p. 127 Systematic drug taking is especially reported
among West African-based militia movements. In fact, [some authors
consider hallucinatory drug intake a critical factor that has
contributed to the desensitization of boy soldiers during their
prolonged exposure to violent aggression and to prepare them for
combat]{.underline}. Utas and Jorgel (2008) described, in their account
of the 'West Side Boys' child soldiers of Sierra Leone, how [most
[fighters used drugs]{.mark} in abundance: crack **[cocaine]{.mark}**,
smoked **[heroin]{.mark}**, ephedrine, benzodiazepines, **[and
marijuana]{.mark}**]{.underline}: 14 The Psychological Impact of Child
Soldiering 333 [Drugs were used in military navigation both to enable
soldiers to act courageously and ultra-violently, and also to make
fighters relax in extreme settings of fear]{.underline}. (Utas & Jorgel,
2008, p. 502) [[Drug abuse]{.mark} may also [develop as]{.mark} a means
of [coping]{.mark} with PTSD]{.underline} (Chilcoat & Breslau, 1998;
Shipherd, Stafford, & Tanner, 2005). Gear (2002) notes that [substance
abuse can be seen as a way [to **escape**]{.mark} **the [emotional
burden]{.mark}**]{.underline} associated with extreme poverty and
unemployment, at the same time being an attempt to cope with
trauma-related symptoms, and thus, is a form of self-medication. In
several samples of Somali (ex-)combatants, our group (Odenwald, Hinkel,
& Schauer, 2007; Odenwald et al., 2007) found that [those with PTSD used
more drugs in order to 'selfmedicate,' especially those who indicated
that drug use helped them forget stressful war experiences]{.underline}
(Odenwald et al., 2005). The main drug (ab)used in Somalia are the
leaves of the khat shrub that contain the amphetamine-like cathinone. In
these studies, we could clearly demonstrate that PTSD leads to higher
khat intake and this, in turn, leads to a higher risk for the
development of psychotic symptoms, such as paranoia. In a large
cross-sectional household survey, involving 4854 randomly selected
persons of the general population of Hargeisa, Somaliland, we (Odenwald
et al., 2005) observed that 12 years after the end of the liberation war
and 6 years after the last fighting, [16% of the ex-combatants were
severely impaired by complex psychological suffering]{.underline},
mostly severe psychotic disorders intermingled with drug abuse,
trauma-related disorders, and emotional problems. In most cases,
uncontrollable behaviour, like aggressive outbreaks, had led to the
situation that helpless family members had chained them for years to
concrete blocks or trees in the backyard of their compounds or that they
had ended up in prison. Among the male adult population, former
combatants with civilian war survivors and persons who never had been
confronted with war (i.e. those who managed to flee abroad before the
war) were compared. The rate of 8% of PTSD, depression, and drug abuse
disorder in the civilian war survivors doubled among the group of
ex-combatants, and reached less than 3% in those without direct war
exposure. In a city like Hargeisa the Capital of Somaliland, every
fourth household had to care for one severely affected, dysfunctional
young man in the household, drawing resources from all members of the
household and forcing the household to lose out on the support and
capacity of one male family member. Depression and Suicidality [The
significant [correlation between]{.mark}
**[p]{.mark}**ost-**[t]{.mark}**raumatic **[s]{.mark}**tress
**[d]{.mark}**isorder [and]{.mark} **clinical [depression]{.mark}** is
scientifically well known]{.underline}. In a large study by Vinck and
colleagues (Vinck et al., 2007) in Northern Uganda, it was found that
[52% of formerly abducted children suffered from depression
symptoms]{.underline}. A follow-up review of Pham et al. (Pham et al.,
2009) with former abductees showed that [40% fulfilled the symptom
criteria for major depression]{.underline}. In our study (Pfeiffer et
al., submitted), using a child soldier sample again from Northern
Uganda, 16% of children who were ever 334 E. Schauer and T. Elbert
abducted had a fully developed major depression, with this rate
increasing to 24% in those who had stayed in captivity 1 month or
longer. The most disturbing finding is the risk of suicidality in the
former child soldier sample of Pfeiffer and colleagues (Pfeiffer et al.,
submitted). In this group, 34% of children showed a risk of suicidality
(17% of children at high risk), with this rate rising to 37% (25% at
high risk) in those who were forced to stay in captivity for 1 month and
longer. [Post-Vietnam studies showed highly [elevated **risks of
suicide**]{.mark} among ex-combatants and veterans of war]{.underline}
(Hendin & Haas, 1991; Kang & Bullman, 2008; Lester, 2005). [Having been
an agent of killing and having been a failure at preventing death and
injury of others are especially related more strongly to general
psychiatric distress and suicide attempts]{.underline} (Fontana,
Rosenheck, & Brett, 1992). The few [investigations that there are among
children indicate a significant [correlation between]{.mark} a childhood
diagnosis of **[PTSD and suicidal ideation]{.mark}**. Guilt might play
an important mediating factor]{.underline}. In the case of child
soldiers, [the guilt about having killed members of the family, friends,
or community members emerged as a key predictor of suicidal
ideation]{.underline} (Pfeiffer et al., submitted). Authors suggest that
[suicidal ideation may be increased additionally when the child's
functioning is impaired]{.underline} (Famularo, Fenton, Kinscherff, &
Augustyn, 1996). In an epidemiological study in the LTTE-controlled
areas of North-Eastern Sri Lanka (Elbert et al., 2009), we observed a
[highly significant relationship between PTSD and risk for
suicide]{.underline}, which was diagnosed for 26% of the children with
PTSD, but only for 7% of children without PTSD. The reasons for these
epidemic proportions are unclear. Researchers suggest that for some
youngsters[, self-poisoning seemed to be the preferred or only method of
dealing with difficult situations]{.underline} (Eddleston, Sheriff, &
Hawton, 1998). [[Child soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} [might simply
**[lack]{.mark} adequate [coping]{.mark} or interpersonal
[skills]{.mark}**, such as the ability to communicate anger and sadness,
or might not be able to place trust in supportive and positively guiding
relationships with adults.]{.underline} Dissociation and Derealization
[[Another,]{.mark} so-called associative [feature]{.mark} of severe
child traumatization, often seen in former child soldiers, [is]{.mark}
the phenomenon of '**[dissociation.]{.mark}**' During times of trauma,
fight or flight responses are rarely options for children,]{.underline}
as they are often physically unable to defend themselves or escape. The
[most readily accessible response to the pain of trauma may be to
activate dissociative mechanisms]{.underline}, involving
[[**disengagement** from the]{.mark} external
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biological defense mechanisms are activated
by the central nervous system, such as depersonalization, derealization,
numbing, and in extreme cases, catatonia and 'tonic immobility' (Perry &
Pollard, 1998). The individual cascade of defense mechanisms that a
survivor has gone through during the traumatic event can replay itself
whenever the fear network, which has evolved peritraumatically, is
activated again by internal or external triggers. Whereby some survivors
have experienced mainly peritraumatic sympathetic activation 14 The
Psychological Impact of Child Soldiering 335 (fleeing-feeling anxious;
fighting-feeling angry and acting out), others went through the whole
defense cascade, with parasympathetic dominance as an end point (e.g.
tonic immobility, no more voluntary movement, sensory de-afferentation,
loss of muscle tonus, fainting) (Schauer & Elbert, 2008). Thus,
peritraumatic dissociation might be allowing the child to
psychologically and physically survive the trauma. Over time, however,
it often becomes nonadaptive, emerging at inappropriate times during,
for example, situations that may trigger verbal or nonverbal/bodily
memories of earlier trauma or at any other time of perceived emotional
threat. Children who have learned to cope with trauma by dissociating
are vulnerable to continuing to do so in response to minor stresses.
[The continued use of dissociation as a way of coping with stress
interferes with the capacity to fully attend to life's ongoing
challenges. During dissociative episodes, the child may stare off and
appear as if he or she is daydreaming]{.underline} (Sack, Angell,
Kinzie, & Rath, 1986). Such [[children may be **misdiagnosed**]{.mark},
e.g. as suffering from ADHD, inattentive type]{.underline} (Joshi &
O'Donnell, 2003). Other children may freeze in response to certain
activating stimuli. Caregivers or teachers may misinterpret this
reaction as an act of defiance. If confronted, more anxious children can
quickly escalate to feeling threatened, 'frozen,' and ultimately resort
to a classic fight or flight response by becoming aggressive or
combative over relatively minor events (Joshi & O'Donnell, 2003; Schauer
& Elbert, 2010). Other children may react to stressors by dissolving
into regressed, dissociative states that may contain micropsychotic
episodes, including auditory command hallucinations. It is not uncommon
for severely traumatized children to hear voices commanding them to harm
themselves or others, which is a dangerous, unpredictable condition.
Consequently, such adolescents can be erroneously misdiagnosed as
suffering from a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia.
Anti-social and Disruptive Behavior PTSD is also significantly
associated with negative behavior against an individual's own family,
the expression of anger and hostility to others, and self-harm (Burton,
Foy, Bwanausi, Johnson, & Moore, 1994; Deykin, 1999; Deykin & Buka,
1997; Dodge, 1993; Dutton et al., 2006; Friedman & Schnurr, 1995;
Golding, 1999; Joshi & O'Donnell, 2003; Lewis, 1992; Perry & Pollard,
1998). [Research shows that [former]{.mark} child [soldiers have
**difficulties**]{.mark} **in [controlling]{.mark} aggressive
[impulses]{.mark}** and have little skills for handling life [without
violence]{.mark}. These [children show]{.mark} **on-going
[aggressiveness]{.mark}** within their families and communities, even
after relocation to their home villages]{.underline} (Wessels, 2006). In
a qualitative study, Magambo and Lett (2004) reported that [former child
soldiers in northern Uganda mainly applied physical violence to resolve
conflicts]{.underline}. Although the children sympathized with victims
of violence, [they **[could not]{.mark} even [think of non-violent
alternatives]{.mark}**, reflecting an absence of adequate social
skills]{.underline}. Most former child [soldiers have spent several
critical years of their development in captivity]{.underline}, under the
constant threat of abuse and manipulation by their 336 E. Schauer and T.
Elbert commanders. Most probably, this period affects the development of
a personal and collective identity (Kanagaratnam, Raundalen, &
Asbjornsen, 2005). In general, [children exposed to war and child
soldiering show a strong identification with their own
group]{.underline} (Gloeckner, 2007; Jensen & Shaw, 1993) and develop a
worldview dominated by political and nationalistic categories (Punamaki
& Suleiman, 1990), which often includes pro-war attitudes (Feshbach,
1994). In the Gloeckner (2007) study, it emerged that the longer
children had stayed in abduction, the stronger was their rebel-related
collective identity. But it may be that their collective identification
might occur post hoc after return to their home communities. Gloeckner
explained that questions and discussions of family and community members
about the cruelty of the LRA's actions may activate a process of
reasoning about what had happened. Former beliefs about 'right' and
'wrong' actions might clash with current ones, and in order to regain
cognitive homeostasis, identification with the rebel group is aspired.
Interestingly, this study showed a positive correlation between
collective identification and reactive aggression (physical and verbal
aggression and anger). In addition, Gloeckner ( 2007) reported that
formerly abducted children with PTSD might be especially vulnerable to
accepting simplistic models of 'good versus bad' -- a black and white
worldview, which is a known cognitive distortion. Although a rigid
political view might be protective during exposure to war events, it
might facilitate violent behavior after returning from the fighting to
individuals' home communities. [Children living in conditions of
political violence and war have been described as 'growing up too soon'
and 'losing their childhood']{.underline} (Boothby & Knudsen, 2000;
UNICEF, 2005, 2006). Levels of conscience seemed to be significantly
related to the severity of PTSD symptomatology, but also with negative
schematizations of self and others and lower self-efficacy ratings
(Goenjian et al., 1999; Joseph, Brewin, Yule, & Williams, 1993; Saigh,
Mroueh, Zimmerman, & Fairbanks, 1995). Ideological Commitment There is
also the discussion on ideological commitment of former child soldiers
to a cause and its influence on mental health. Some studies (Muldoon &
Wilson, 2001; Punamaki, 1996) indicate a protective mechanism,
associating strong ideology with good mental health in adolescents,
however, mainly in individuals who were exposed to low levels of
political violence. A recent study among Tamil child soldiers shows that
this protective mechanism only worked in the group of those who were not
among the highest exposure intensity group, e.g. length of exposure,
being wounded, having killed, having tortured, direct combat
(Kanagaratnam et al., 2005). Tibetan refugee children also reported that
the sense of participating in their nation's struggle against an
oppressor and their strong Buddhist beliefs would have protected them
against mental-health difficulties and accelerated the healing process
(Servan-Schreiber, Le Lin, & Birmaher, 1998). Cognitive appraisals of
experiences seem to matter in symptom development in various forms 14
The Psychological Impact of Child Soldiering 337 and [strong feelings of
guilt and responsibility might increase trauma symptoms]{.underline}. In
Kanagaratnam's study (Kanagaratnam et al., 2005) personal achievement in
combat, popularity, knowledge and experience acquired by being a
combatant, friendship, and the support of the community were considered
as the best of combat life by the youngsters; death of friends, killings
of their own people, guilt of being responsible for unnecessary
killings, and being confronted with morally conflicting situations were
the worst experiences for most of them. Cognitive, Educational, and
Occupational Impairment When comparing abductees with non-abductees,
Blattman (2006) came to the conclusion that [especially [traumatic
experiences]{.mark} during abduction [had an adverse impact on
education]{.mark}, less years of schooling, greater **[reading
problems]{.mark}**, lower occupational functioning, and **[lower work
quality]{.mark}** later in life.]{.underline} What research has shown is
that exposure to [[trauma]{.mark} in formative years may [affect]{.mark}
the [maturation of the]{.mark} central [nervous system]{.mark} and the
regulatory neuro-endocrine systems]{.underline}, as outlined above.
Resulting from exposure to traumatic stress and PTSD, the
[**[inability]{.mark} to concentrate** and learn often [translates
into]{.mark} a **refusal to attend** school and eventual
**[drop-out]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Dodge, 1993). In a study by Duncan
(2000), [college enrollment rates continued to drop]{.underline} at each
subsequent semester until, by their senior year, only 35% of students
who had suffered multiple abuses were in attendance. In addition,
[adolescents with PTSD,]{.underline} compared to adolescents who have
suffered a stressful experience but did not develop PTSD, were [shown to
have significantly lower scores on a standardized achievement test
compared to their controls]{.underline} (Saigh, Mroueh, & Bremner,
1997). A study by McFarlane and colleagues (McFarlane et al., 1987)
showed that 18% of surveyed children after a disaster were
underachieving educationally after 8 months; this figure had a
statistically significant increase to 25% at 26 months. The
[[underachieving children were]{.mark} also [those with]{.mark} the
**[highest trauma]{.mark} symptom scores** and with the most days absent
from school, reporting headaches, stomachaches, and feeling miserable
and worried as their reasons for absenteeism]{.underline}. Perez & Widom
(1994) asserted that child abuse represents a significant risk factor
for poor long-term intellectual and academic outcomes, e.g. lower IQ and
reading ability. [Findings of low IQ in traumatized children were also
described]{.underline} by Mannarino and Cohen (1986). In his book
'Scarred minds,' Somasundaram (1998) presented a list of psychosocial
problems in adolescents, sampled from six different schools and
colleagues across the war-affected North-Eastern educational zones of
Sri Lanka. Within that study, 28--65% of children reported loss of
memory, 33--60% loss of concentration, and 35--60% loss of motivation to
achieve in education. Besides psychometric testing for psychiatric
disorders, our group (Elbert et al., 2009) undertook cognitive and
memory tests in a sub-sample validation group of Tamil school children,
residing at the time in the LTTE-controlled areas of NorthEastern Sri
Lanka. This region had been affected by two decades of civil war at the
time of assessment in 2002. All traumatized children with a diagnosis of
PTSD 338 E. Schauer and T. Elbert in the sample reported lasting
interference of experiences with their daily life. The
neuropsychological testing and the investigation of school grades
validated mentalhealth outcomes further and accentuated some specific
cognitive problems that were associated with PTSD, especially the
deficiency in memory functions. In fact, the affected children's
performance decreased with the number of traumatic events experienced.
[The children's grades in school, when averaged separately for the two
groups and across disciplines, reflected that the problems in
functioning were mental in nature, with a focus on deficits in the
verbal abilities]{.underline}. [Employment possibilities are already
scarce in post-war societies, and researchers observe that [finding a
job is]{.mark} even more [difficult]{.mark} for
ex-combatants]{.underline} (Gear, 2002; Heinemann-Gruder, Pietz, &
Duffy, 2003). Mogapi (2004) reported from the South African DDR program
that [ex-combatants, who suffer from a trauma-spectrum disorder, have
clear-cut difficulties on the job, suffer increased [concentration
problems]{.mark}, and are more likely to act out aggressively in
difficult situations, which eventually [lead]{.mark}s [to job
loss]{.mark}. In turn, the situation of [unemployment]{.mark} causes
feelings of helplessness and thus [aggravates]{.mark} symptoms of
depression in [a **downward-spiral effect.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Child soldiers experience [depersonalization]{.underline}\-\--that eliminates their [value to life]{.underline} and outweighs typical violence

It\'s in the eyes, vacant, chilling. A general sense of the lives of
child soldiers exists for most people in the West through ideas such as
these: young children who have been abducted, children who have killed
their parents, children who have been tortured, girls who have been
raped, eight-year-olds who have been used as mine sweeps, and those who
have gotten out of control because of drugs, gun powder, and alcohol.
This understanding exists in part through photographs depicting these
children, transmitting emotions, and anticipating an affective response
in us, the viewers. With images of child soldiers in the public domain,
the questions of how these images are seen, read, interpreted, and how
they evoke emotional responses are important as they relate to the
impact the images can have on the framing of the issue for the Western
public. As an entree into understanding how people read, respond to
images of child soldiers, interpret the lives of child soldiers through
photographs, and the potential effect that photographs of child soldiers
can have, I conducted interviews during which I showed selected photos
of child soldiers. [Individual [discussions were held]{.mark} with
twelve adults between the ages of thirty and sixty-six. All of these
participants were university educated, all of them lived in a
medium-sized, Canadian city, and each discussion took approximately one
hour. During the interviews, [I asked people to tell me what they saw
when they looked at]{.mark} the images, what they noticed in particular,
what emotions the images evoked, and what they thought about the
condition of the lives of these children]{.underline}. Three days
following each of these initial interviews, I re-contacted participants
to ask them to imagine how they would respond if their own child or a
child close to them were a child soldier. Second, I asked them what
issue and/or questions these images left them with. The photographs
selected for the interviews were in a glossy twelve-by-nine inch picture
book titled Child Soldiers, edited by Leora Kahn who is the founder of
the organization Proof: media for social justice, and published by
powerHouse Books. [Divided by country, this book contains mainly colored
[photos of child soldiers]{.mark} in Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Uganda, Liberia, Sierra
Leone, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma, Afghanistan, Palestine, and
Iraq.]{.underline} The book also contains an introduction by Luis
Moreno-Ocampo, former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court;
drawings made by child soldiers depicting armed conflict; several short
narratives describing the situation of specific child soldiers; brief
explanatory notes relating to affected countries; words of the song
\"Warchild\" by Emmanuel Jal, a former child soldier from Sudan; short
articles by Jo Becker, chairperson of the Coalition to Stop the Use of
Child Soldiers and children\'s rights advocacy director for Human Rights
Watch; Mike Wessells, professor of psychology at Columbia University;
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois; and Jimmie Briggs, author of Innocents
Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War. Thirty-four photojournalists
contributed their images of child soldiers to the creation of this book.
Although Kahn does not state the book\'s purpose, in her preface she
makes clear her position concerning the use of child soldiers in armed
conflict when she states, \"the figure of the child dressed and
outfitted for war is indeed a particularly modern obscenity.\" In
considering participants\' responses, I [divided the photographs in the
book into six separate types: individual pictures, which were generally
close-up shots; group pictures of child soldiers sitting and waiting;
child soldiers walking or marching in formation; child soldiers in the
back of trucks or vans; girl soldiers; and post-conflict images of
ex-child soldiers]{.underline}. Only one photo was of boys and girls
together and only a few were photos of a single girl or small group of
girls. One [photo was of boys who looked to be stoned and while two
photos showed children appearing to be threatening, no photo showed them
as ferocious perpetrators.]{.underline} Together, participants and I
went through and examined the pictures that I had highlighted to ensure
that the same photos were considered by all participants. We also
stopped at certain ones participants themselves selected, allowing them
to study in detail those photos that most intrigued them. [Overall, all
of [the participants responded to]{.mark} the [photos with]{.mark} a
mixture of [anger, sadness, and]{.mark} with comments about how
imagination-defying the lives of child soldiers must be, and with the
following words and [questions]{.mark} hanging in the air: Why? How can
this be? What can be done?]{.underline} What about the rest of the lives
of these kids? While participants noticed that [in most of the photos
the children were carrying weapons, and [all commented]{.mark} that
[**fun was absent** from]{.mark} the lives of [these
children]{.mark}]{.underline}, no one made links to issues such as
poverty, addictions, or physical or mental illness. No one discussed
child soldiers as perpetrators. In addition, none of the participants
expanded the conversation to the political context of child soldiery,
although almost all stated that the practice had to be stopped. I joined
the guerilla when I was ten years old. I wanted to serve in an armed
group; it appealed to me. After five years I withdrew I was
tired---very, very tired. ---Testimony of child soldier from Colombia
Reacting to the images of a single child, [participants generally
responded by saying one word followed after a pause by another
word]{.underline}. [[Words]{.mark} used [to express what participants
read in]{.mark} the [pictures]{.mark} and particularly focusing on the
child\'s expression [were: **misery, abject, lifeless,
deadened**]{.mark} **look, [vacant]{.mark} eyes**, it\'s in the eyes,
and such worry]{.underline}. A comment from one participant was that [if
these children could speak to the camera, they would only
cry]{.underline}. At times, people spent a few minutes on a specific
photo in this way. One image in particular attracted the attention of
participants. It was a close-up of cyanide capsules on a string around a
boy\'s neck. Beside the capsules on the string hung a small cross of
Jesus. I like rifles. Having a rifle gives me a good feeling. I just
love to hold them. When I had a rifle, I was in charge. I had a very
good time with my friends. Sometimes I think of returning. ---Testimony
of child soldier from Colombia [[When commenting on]{.mark} the [photos
of child soldiers]{.mark} sitting and waiting [in groups, participants
noticed]{.mark} the **[stooped postures]{.mark}** of children
[and]{.mark} their **[defeated body language]{.mark}**]{.underline},
their [[limited interaction]{.mark} with each other, a **[lack
of]{.mark} a sense of [determination]{.mark}**, and an **[absence of
passion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They stated that [the [children
appeared]{.mark} [devoid of emotion]{.mark}, expressionless. [They had
**no animation, no spark**]{.mark}. Participants [also]{.mark} noticed
**[deep sadness in]{.mark} the [children\'s eyes]{.mark}** []{.mark}and
their troubled expressions. In one photo of two boys, participants
interpreted the boys\' expressions as being brainwashed, yet
stoical]{.underline}. [More chilling than the weapon he held was what he
wore on this back; a pink teddy-bear backpack, a telling symbol of his
lost youth.]{.underline} ---Jimmie Briggs Reading [[the photos
of]{.mark} groups of [children walking]{.mark} or marching [in
formation]{.mark}, participants commented on [the children\'s frozen
expressions,]{.mark} their [raw sadness, and]{.mark} their
[frowns]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [[children]{.mark} were
intently paying attention while walking or marching and [seemed to be
numb and beaten]{.mark} down]{.underline}. As well, [several
participants said [they]{.mark} appeared to **[look like]{.mark} a group
of [ghosts]{.mark}** and seemed depleted in spirit. These [children
looked]{.mark} to participants [like automatons with dead faces]{.mark},
closed off from the world. They made us overpower a group of government
soldiers and take their weapons. Then we had to cut them up with pangas
\[machetes\]. The rebels told me that if I refused, they would kill me.
Another boy was chopped up as an example. So, I killed the three
government soldiers.]{.underline} [---Child soldier from Uganda as told
to Jimmie Briggs]{.underline} In the photos of children in the back of
trucks, [participants read fearless expressions and at times
bravado]{.underline}. They noted how the children appeared as though
they had no fear of dying or of killing, and how they looked as though
they would not hesitate to kill. They stated that [[the children seemed
as]{.mark} though [they had **lost their identities**]{.mark}**, were
[depersonalized]{.mark}**, and [had no sense of self]{.mark}, like **the
waking dead**. They had flat stares, yet looked anguished. [The children
looked]{.mark} at the camera [with vacant eyes]{.mark}, appearing
resigned to their situation. [It was **not possible to see**]{.mark}
**their [character or]{.mark} their
[personalities]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Rose was 10 years old when she
was abducted by the LRA on her way to visit her grandmother. She was
raped, beaten, and passed from one soldier to another. She gave birth to
her first child at the age of 15. After the baby was born, she felt
there was no way to escape. ---Profile of a girl child soldier from
Uganda [The images of girls tended to be the most problematic for
participants. They often commented on the thicker layers of difficulty,
pain, and complexity girls must face]{.underline}. One participant said,
\"When I see the girls, it throws me off because we\'re so used to
seeing images of boys as soldiers. This confuses me. This girl is in a
male environment. How much more difficult that must be.\" [Participants
noted deep sadness in the girls\' eyes, looks of depletion, and most of
all, their wary expressions.]{.underline} I have nightmares. I feel as
if somebody is scolding me harshly and threatening me, so I get
petrified from time to time. ---Testimony of girl child soldier from
Nepal [A few of the images were of [ex-child soldiers]{.mark} following
armed conflict. Although these images displayed children in such
contexts as playing sports or learning a trade, participants interpreted
the children in the images as [appear]{.mark}ing **[defeated and
exhausted]{.mark}**. In one image of an ex-girl soldier with two of her
three children following war, she appeared to participants to **not have
adequate strength, energy, or life force** to take care of her
children.]{.underline} In another image of several boys in a prison,
participants noted that this photo seemed to be an anomaly as it was the
only one in which boys had a look of defiance and anger on their faces.

#### The US already has a law that bans weapons sales to countries with child soldiers\-\--the Child Soldiers Prevention Act or CSPA\-\--but the act contains a provision that allows the President to waive prohibitions to offending governments so they can receive US weapons\-\--in 2018, Trump waived 97% of assistance that should have been prohibited 

Rachel **Stohl**, 10-24-20**18**, managing director at the Stimson
Center, Shannon Dick, research associate with the Conventional Defense
Program, The Trump Administration is Failing to Stop the Use of Child
Soldiers, National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-administration-failing-stop-use-child-soldiers-34242

In what is becoming a yearly disappointment, [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration again [missed a **key opportunity** to]{.mark} encourage
foreign governments to [stop]{.mark} recruiting and using [child
soldiers]{.mark}. Late last month when President Donald [Trump]{.mark}
released his determinations with respect to the Child Soldiers
Prevention Act (CSPA) of 2008, he [declared]{.mark} that it [is in the
national interest]{.mark} of the United States [to provide]{.mark} U.S.
[military assistance to seven countries known to]{.mark}
recruit/[use]{.mark}---or support the recruitment/use of---[children in
armed conflict]{.mark}. In so doing, the Trump administration chose to
overlook notable human-rights concerns and undermine U.S. efforts to
prevent the use of child soldiers.]{.underline}

Ten years ago, [Congress passed **[the CSPA]{.mark}** with the
**[goal]{.mark}** of **[leveraging U.S. arms transfers]{.mark}** and
military assistance **[to dissuade foreign governments from]{.mark}
recruiting and [using children in]{.mark} their national
[militaries]{.mark}** or government-sponsored armed groups]{.underline}.
The CSPA requires the secretary of state to identify countries that
recruit and use child soldiers. [Once [listed]{.mark}, those
[governments are prohibited from receiving]{.mark} seven specific
categories of U.S. military assistance]{.underline} provided by the
Departments of State and Defense. [These programs]{.underline} are often
the most coveted by foreign governments and [include:
**[d]{.mark}**irect **[c]{.mark}**ommercial **[s]{.mark}**ales, excess
defense articles, foreign military financing, **[f]{.mark}**oreign
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary **[s]{.mark}**ales, international military and
education training assistance (IMET), peacekeeping operations assistance
(PKO) and Section 1206 assistance]{.underline}.

[In June 2018, the State Department identified eleven countries as
violators under the CSPA: Burma (Myanmar), the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), Iran, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan,
Syria and Yemen. While under the law these countries are technically
prohibited from receiving U.S. military assistance in fiscal year (FY)
2019, **[the president can waive]{.mark} the CSPA's
[prohibitions]{.mark} and allow these identified governments to remain
eligible to receive U.S. weapons and military assistance.**]{.underline}

Do You Know What Happened Today In History?

The 2018 list is the second opportunity the Trump administration has had
to demonstrate its commitment to stopping the use of child soldiers. [In
2017, the list omitted notorious violators Afghanistan, Iraq and Myanmar
and was seen as a political statement demonstrating the lack of
importance the Trump administration placed on stopping this horrific
practice. Although the 2018 list was more comprehensive in scope, **the
[Trump]{.mark} administration['s]{.mark} application of the
[waivers]{.mark} has [made a mockery of the CSPA
list.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In its release of the presidential waivers last week, the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [announced]{.mark} that it was
[waiving]{.mark} CSPA [prohibitions for]{.mark} seven of the eleven
governments identified on the State Department's child soldiers list,
thereby allowing all the military assistance requested by the U.S.
government to [**Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and
Yemen** to proceed, despite]{.mark} their records of using or supporting
[the use of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yemen, however, is
currently not slated to receive any CSPA-relevant military assistance in
FY 19.

Only seven of the eleven countries identified on this year's CSPA list
are slated to receive U.S. military assistance in fiscal year 2019: the
DRC, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan. Therefore,
with the Trump administration's recent determination, six of these seven
countries will not be affected by the CSPA's prohibitions. Iraq will
remain eligible to receive \$1 million in IMET, Mali and Niger will both
remain eligible to receive \$700,000 in IMET, Nigeria remains eligible
to receive \$800,000 in IMET, Somalia remains eligible to receive
\$225,000 in IMET and \$95 million in PKO assistance, and South Sudan
remains eligible to receive over \$24 million in PKO assistance. [No
waivers were provided for Burma, the DRC, Iran or Syria. However, no
assistance has thus far been requested under the CSPA programs for
Burma, Iran or Syria, meaning the CSPA will have no real impact on those
countries]{.underline}. All told, [**the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[waived]{.mark} more than [97 percent of]{.mark} otherwise prohibited
[assistance]{.mark}** [to countries with]{.mark} known [child soldier
abuses]{.mark}, allowing \$123 million in U.S. military assistance to
continue to flow to these governments.]{.underline}

[The only government facing any consequences from its continued use and
recruitment of child soldiers is the DRC. The DRC had been slated to
receive funds through IMET and PKO, but it is now ineligible to receive
this assistance because it did not receive a waiver from the Trump
administration]{.underline}. That means that DRC will miss out on
\$375,000 in IMET and more than \$2 million in PKO assistance due to
their continued use of child soldiers.

One government out of eleven. Or, put another way, [an implementation
rate of less than 10 percent [for a law]{.mark} that the U.S. government
has traditionally [held up as a **key instrument** for combating human
trafficking]{.mark} in the form of child soldiers. Governments choosing
to abuse their most vulnerable populations can continue to do so without
being held accountable. The [Trump]{.mark} administration continues to
[send the **wrong message** and fails to emphasize]{.mark} that
[abuse]{.mark} of children [will not be tolerated]{.mark}. Instead, the
Trump administration is actively ignoring the plight of affected
children around the world and [demonstrating that]{.mark} its
**[assurances to protect children ring hollow]{.mark}**. The CSPA's
drafters intended the waivers to be used judiciously to address
national-security needs. However, the Trump administration is instead
using the waivers to continue arming perpetual violators of the
law]{.underline}. Children exploited by parties to armed conflict
deserve better.

#### Fully enforcing the CSPA makes the threat of ending arms sales credible and is key to ending the use of child soldiers\-\--waivers prevent the US from sending a strong, clear signal opposing the practice\-\--US action spurs global momentum and influences governments to promote democratic norms

Impact of Arms Transfers

**[[The global arms trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- in its legitimate
and illegitimate forms -- [**[continues to fuel]{.mark} the [recruitment
of child soldiers]{.mark}** around the world.]{.underline} Indeed, [the
dynamics of this trade have made weapons more accessible to more actors,
and [despite]{.mark} the [efforts of the international community]{.mark}
to limit the flow of weapons to parties complicit in violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law, both legal and illicit
arms transfers continue to be made to human rights abusing governments
and nefarious rebel groups]{.underline}. Many of these actors forcibly
recruit children to undertake menial tasks or to serve as combatants.
[For years, civil society, national governments, and international
organizations have recognized the links between arms transfers and the
unlawful recruitment or use of children in armed conflict, and called
upon states to abolish and criminalize arms transfers to state and
non-state actors that have records of recruiting and using children in
armed conflict. Yet, **[few countries have actually taken steps to
limit]{.mark} transfers of [weapons]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} could
[facilitate]{.mark} the use of [children in]{.mark} armed
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, many countries with a proven
track record of recruiting child soldiers rely on weapons and military
assistance from some of the world's leading arms exporters.

China, for example, has exported millions of dollars in small arms and
light weapons to South Sudan, where child soldier recruitment is rampant
with more than 10,000 children believed to be fighting in government and
rebel armies. Similarly, Germany and France -- both among the top five
weapons exporters in the world -- have exported arms to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the national army and various rebel
groups are known to forcibly recruit child soldiers. And the United
States, the world's largest arms exporter, has consistently provided
weapons and military assistance to Yemen to be used in counterterrorism
operations, despite widespread international condemnation for its use of
child soldiers.

The U.S. Response

[**[The U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[is one of the few
countries to have taken steps]{.mark}** to condition the provision of
military assistance based upon on a country's record of child soldier
use. [Through the]{.mark} Child Soldiers Prevention Act
(**[CSPA]{.mark}**), [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates implemented
national legislation to [prohibit arms transfers]{.mark} and military
training [to countries identified]{.mark} by the State Department as
[having]{.mark} recruited and [used child soldiers]{.mark} in national
militaries or government-supported armed groups]{.underline}. In
addition, [[the Act incentivizes U.S. military assistance by encouraging
governments]{.mark} that use child soldiers [to end the]{.mark}
internationally condemned [practice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Though the CSPA does not provide complete prohibition against all U.S.
military assistance, it does limit foreign military sales, direct
commercial sales, excess defense articles, international military
education and training, foreign military financing, and some
peacekeeping operations assistance -- which represent the largest U.S.
arms sales and military assistance programs. Under the Act, governments
can receive otherwise prohibited assistance to professionalize their
militaries if the U.S. president certifies that the country is taking
reasonable steps to demobilize child soldiers as well as providing
rehabilitation and reintegration assistance. Certification can lead to
the waiving of the CPSA's restrictions and result in the provision of
military education, training, and nonlethal supplies.

[**[Although a potentially powerful tool, the U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates **[has not]{.mark} consistently [leveraged the Act's
utility to send a strong and clear message]{.mark} against the use of
child soldiers. [Instead, Washington has invoked the Act's waiver
authority]{.mark} more often than not to provide full and partial
waivers to countries with known records of child soldier
use**]{.underline}. For example, between 2012 and 2014, the State
Department identified the DRC, South Sudan, and Yemen as having
recruited and used children in armed conflict. However, the
administration has consistently provided waivers to the prohibitions
warranted by the CSPA that would otherwise limit U.S. military
assistance to these countries.

In some cases, these waivers amount to millions of dollars in military
assistance. This year, Somalia might receive upwards of \$115 million in
sanctionable assistance that would otherwise be prohibited by the CSPA.
Yemen could have access to at least \$26 million that would also be
prohibited under the terms of the Act. These provisions of assistance
stand in contrast to conditions on the ground, where child recruitment
by government-supported armed groups in Yemen has increased and 200
children are believed to have been recruited by the Somali national army
and allied militias in 2013 alone.

Grounds for Optimism?

[**[In other parts of the world, explicit action like the CSPA is even
rarer]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Belgium, for example, has legislation that
prohibits the export and transit of arms to countries that use child
soldiers in their national armies. However, [[most states have yet to
develop regulations]{.mark} that respond to the established connection
[between arms transfers and the use of child
soldiers]{.mark}.]{.underline} The new Arms Trade Treaty might be one
vehicle that governments can use to fill that void. Because children are
at risk of being recruited and used by government forces,
paramilitaries, and other armed groups, efforts to condition arms
transfers must be broader in scope.

[**[Globally, measures like the CSPA could be used to]{.mark}** mitigate
and ultimately **[end the use of child soldiers]{.mark}** in national
militaries and government-supported armed groups. It]{.underline}, along
with similar measures, [should be considered within a larger,
coordinated context to support sustainable institutions and security
apparatuses in emerging democracies. The implementation of arms and
assistance prohibitions should complement democracy promotion and
security sector reform. [Prohibitions]{.mark} can and [should be
**linked to**]{.mark} the signing and implementation of
**[national]{.mark}** action [**plans** focused on]{.mark} demobilizing
and [ending recruitment of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
short, [these [measures can be used to **encourage changes in government
behavior** and]{.mark} to **[promote democratic norms within the
military]{.mark}** structure that do not rely on the use of child
soldiers.]{.underline}

#### States are responsible for child soldiers in armed groups\-\--they should be required to acknowledge the issue and take measures to prevent HR violations

Senior Researcher at Child Soldiers International (CSI) et al Published

soldiers" Child Soldiers International,

The [Optional Protocol covers all types of military forces: state armed
forces, non- state armed groups allied to states and non-state armed
opposition groups that are independent of any state]{.underline}
involvement. Articles 1 to 3 refer to national armies and other legally
established or officially constituted state armed forces. Armed groups
"that are distinct from the armed forces of a State" are covered by
Article 4 of the Optional Protocol. As has been noted elsewhere, a
government can declare a group either to be part of the armed forces of
the state or as not being part of them. There is no third option: all
are covered and either way the Protocol confers obligations on states.7

The wording of Article 4 was left intentionally vague to cover a broad
rangebof armed groups. However, the fact that [states have
responsibility to prevent recruitment by armed groups]{.underline}
[covered by this provision is clear. **Specifically, [states are
required to "take all feasible measures to prevent" recruitment and use
of children]{.mark}** [by such groups]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What constitutes "[feasible measures" depends on the type of
relationship between the state and the armed groups.]{.underline}
Although states may have limited capacity to influence the practice of
armed groups against which they are fighting, when the armed groups are
allied to them there will be at least some level of influence over such
groups and their actions[: [the stronger the level of control]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [state over these groups]{.mark}, the [more extensive
the measures the government]{.mark} can, [and is required to, take to
comply with its obligations]{.mark} under Article 4.]{.underline}

Under international law, a state's responsibility may be engaged in
three different ways:

Firstly, [where an armed group is acting]{.underline} on instruction or
under the direction or control of a state, [[even when]{.mark} the
[group does not have a legal basis and is not officially
recognised]{.mark} by the state]{.underline}, its members are de facto
state officials **[and [the state is directly responsible for their
acts]{.mark}]{.underline}**.8

Secondly, [even when a state does not exercise effective or overall
control over armed groups]{.underline} with which it is allied, **[[it
may still be]{.mark} [directly responsible for human rights violations
committed by state officials in support of]{.mark} these [armed
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Such would be the
case]{.mark},]{.underline} for example[[, if]{.mark} the [armed
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} or other state officials assist or [[are
complicit in]{.mark} the [recruitment]{.mark} and use [of children by
state-allied armed groups]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

State officials' support for the commission of crimes by allied armed
groups, such as unlawful recruitment and use of children, may also carry
individual criminal responsibility. In May 2012, for example, the
Special Court for Sierra Leone found Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and
abetting the commission of crimes committed by armed groups active
during the armed conflict in Sierra Leone. The former President of
Liberia was found to have provided arms, ammunition, operational support
and encouragement which contributed substantially to the commission of
crimes by these armed groups, including conscripting or enlisting
children under the age of 15 years or using them to participate actively
in hostilities.9

Thirdly, and [more broadly]{.underline}[, [under human rights and
international humanitarian law, states have an obligation to protect
individuals from abuses]{.underline}]{.mark} committed by non- state
armed groups.10 The triggering of this obligation does not require proof
of any sort of state support to the armed groups: the state has a
stand-alone obligation to act with due diligence to protect individuals
from human rights abuses. [The [state clearly fails]{.mark} to fulfil
this obligation [if,]{.mark} instead of taking measures to protect
children]{.underline} from being recruited and used by armed groups,
**[[it turns a blind eye and supports]{.mark} [these groups with
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** or in other ways.

#### Risk for future child soldier use exists even if present conflict ends\-\--legal ambiguity means factors that allow initial recruitment remains

The [[risk to children of recruitment]{.mark} and use in armed
conflict]{.underline}, while often only apparent once a conflict is in
full swing, [[can continue after]{.mark} [the end of hostilities
unless]{.mark} practical [measures are taken to
address]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[legal and institutional
shortcomings]{.mark} which allowed children to be recruited]{.underline}
by the armed forces [in the first instance.]{.underline}

In the last decade a number of armed conflicts in which children are
known to have been used by state armed forces have drawn to a close. [As
hostilities have ceased, large numbers of children have been released
from fighting]{.underline} forces in the context of broader disarmament,
demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) initiatives[. However, [unless
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}, the **[[problems]{.mark} which
[facilitated underage recruitment and use during the conflict will
remain, making the future re-emergence of]{.mark} the [practice
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[In Chad]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, where [[child soldiers were
extensively used by parties to armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}
including the Chadian National Army (Armée nationale tchadienne, ANT),
[[there was]{.mark} a marked [decrease in incidents]{.mark} of underage
recruitment [after 2009]{.mark}]{.underline}. While encouraging, the
trend is attributable in large part to improvements in the security
situation and normalisation of relations between Chad and Sudan.6 In the
meantime, [factors which contributed to unlawful child
recruitment]{.underline} and hence use -- [namely a residual legal
ambiguity in relation to the minimum age]{.underline} of recruitment;
informal and [often corrupt recruitment practices; absence of both the
means to determine and processes to verify the age of new recruits; and
lack of oversight and accountability -- remain in place]{.underline}.

Improved security in Chad provides the most promising opportunity in
years to address the question of how it is that children come to be
associated with the ANT and to begin to close the routes through which
this can happen. [[Preventing future underage recruitment
i]{.mark}s,]{.underline} however, [[dependent on]{.mark} military and
associated [reform]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is to some extent
reflected in the "Action Plan" for the cessation of child soldier
recruitment and use by the ANT and associated forces agreed by the
government of Chad and the UN in June 2011. In addition to commitments
to release and reintegrate any children in ANT ranks, the plan includes
agreement to put in place effective age verification mechanisms and, in
support of this, to strengthen the national birth registration system.
It also addresses the need for accountability through commitments to
criminalise recruitment and use of children in national law and to
promptly investigate and prosecute individuals for non- compliance.7

[[Achieving this]{.mark}]{.underline} and other elements of the plan,
though[, [is dependent on political will]{.mark} and the commitment of
resources [by the government]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which is not a
given]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[It will also require international
engagement including support for security sector
reform]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a period extending to several years at
least. It is not clear, however, that this support will be forthcoming.
Within months of the action plan being agreed other priorities had taken
over and it was apparent that the UN Country Team did not have
sufficient financial or logistical capacity to support its full
implementation or to reliably assess whether the proposed measures had
been successful in bringing about the release of all children in ANT
ranks and in ending further recruitment. In the meantime, the limited
program of military reform currently under way in [[Chad does not
address the prevention of recruitment]{.mark} and use of child
soldiers]{.underline} (see section 5.3).8 In this context,
[[C]{.mark}hild [S]{.mark}oldiers [I]{.mark}nternational [was]{.mark}
concerned, but [not surprised, to learn]{.mark} that [new cases of
unlawful recruitment]{.mark} of children [occurred in
2012]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}9

The case of [[Côte d'Ivoire demonstrates the dangers of ignoring]{.mark}
the importance of]{.underline} longer-term support for [[structural
reform]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here child recruitment and use was
pervasive during the 2002--3 armed conflict and in the political unrest
that followed. Many [[hundreds of children were released]{.mark} from
fighting forces [following]{.mark} the [end of active
hostilities]{.mark}. [However, little progress was made in addressing
factors]{.mark}]{.underline} which had previously facilitated child
soldier recruitment and use, with the result that children became
involved in renewed hostilities when political violence broke out in
2010.

Although child recruitment and use by Côte d'Ivoire's armed forces was
assessed by the UN to have ended by 2006, and by armed groups affiliated
to the government by 2007,10 [there were indications that the government
was not fully committed to following through]{.underline} [with
measures]{.underline} that were needed [to protect children from future
recruitment]{.underline} or use. Among these was the government's
failure to act on a commitment made in 2006 to the UN Security Council
Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict (SCWG) to ratify the
Optional Protocol "as soon as possible".11 The government also ignored
recommendations of the UN Secretary-General and the SCWG to initiate
rigorous and timely investigations and prosecutions of perpetrators of
crimes against children.12 Finally, and perhaps most significantly, [the
[network of pro-government youth militias which proliferated following
the 2002 crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} and [which were reported to have
child soldiers]{.underline} in their ranks were [[never
dismantled]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Chapter 4).13

[[When]{.mark} political [violence broke out]{.mark}]{.underline}
following the refusal of the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, to
concede defeat following an election run-off in November 2010,
**[[children were once again mobilised]{.mark} by forces [on both
sides]{.mark}]{.underline}**.14 These included the state armed forces
and armed groups that remained loyal to former President Gbagbo, and
forces loyal to the president-elect, Alassane Ouattara.

The end of hostilities and return to relative normalcy, if not full
security, in Côte d'Ivoire provide another chance to tackle underlying
problems which made likely, if not inevitable, children's participation
in the latest armed conflict. The country's accession to the Optional
Protocol in March 2012 is a promising sign, as is the reported release
of children associated with fighting forces.15 However, to minimise the
possibility of children once again becoming involved in any future
hostilities, [[international engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} and support
[[should continue until all provisions]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
Optional Protocol [[are]{.mark} fully
[implemented]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As is the case with Chad[,
this is necessarily a long-term exercise involving profound reform of
the military as well as efforts]{.underline} [towards
strengthening]{.underline} broader [legal and institutional protections
for children against future recruitment]{.underline} and use as
soldiers.

### Framing adv

#### Children should be the first priority in any impact calculus\-\--

Virginia **Gamba 18**, Special Representative of the Secretary-General
for Children and Armed Conflict in Office of the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG/CAAC),
Nov 18, 2018, Building Peace: Protecting Children in Conflict,
https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/building-peace-protecting-children-in-conflict/

"[The protection of children is a topic of universal resonance for all
of us]{.underline}," highlighted the Director-General of UN Office in
Geneva, Michael Møller, as he kick started Geneva Peace Week 2018 with
the event Building Peace: Protecting Children in Conflict on 4 November
2018. "This type of event is exactly why we started Geneva Peace Week,
here in the City of Peace, where we bring together the richness of
different actors for frank discussions on challenging, but pressing
realities," he said.

The event, organized by the Office of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General (SRSG) for Children and Armed Conflict (CAAC) and
co-sponsored by the Permanent Representations of Belgium and Uruguay to
the UN, highlighted that [[ending and preventing violations against
children in armed conflict is]{.mark} not only [a **moral
imperative**]{.mark} but can [also contribute]{.mark}d [to building
**sustainable peace**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The event also contributed
to building support for the Special Representative's strategic focus on
prevention and presented ways in which Member States, civil society and
others contribute to building peace through the implementation of the
CAAC agenda and related prevention initiatives.

"What binds New York and Geneva together is the agenda of prevention,
which is the very topic of our side-event. We'll indeed discuss today
how [we can build sustainable peace in ending and preventing violations
and violence against children in armed conflict. Children, who represent
roughly half of the world's population affected by conflict, largely
remain invisible victims]{.underline}," emphasized the Permanent
Representative of Belgium to the United Nations in Geneva, H.E. Amb.
Geert Muylle, in his opening remarks.

"[[Ending violations against children in times of war]{.mark} is the
primary focus]{.underline} of my work. [But we do not stop there.
**Preventing** **violations** -- and therefore contributing to building
peace -- [is our **ultimate goal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," emphasized the
SRSG for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba. The mandate of the
Special Representative has been given stronger tools to prevent
violations against children affected by conflict through the adoption in
July 2018 of Security Council Resolution 2427. Reaffirming the important
role the Special Representative can play in contributing to conflict
prevention, the resolution calls upon States and the United Nations to
mainstream child protection into conflict prevention activities and
conflict and post-conflict situations with the aim of sustaining peace
and preventing conflict.

"The war took everything: my family, my friends, my childhood." Messeh
Leone, advocate for children affected by war

Messeh Leone experienced war at a very young age in his country, Sierra
Leone. "But I've been among the lucky ones," said the young man who now
lives in the United Kingdom and advocates for children affected by war.
"[[Society]{.mark} generally [doesn't]{.mark} really want to [listen to
children, their voices]{.mark} are easily **[discarded]{.mark}**. That's
why education is important. [Children need to be guided and
protected]{.mark} to be able to bring their voice to the
table]{.underline}," he said, emphasizing the global responsibility to
protect children from war.

World Vision Representative Erica Hall highlighted the importance of a
collaborative approach to better protect children and building peace.
"[[If we want sustainable peace, it won't happen without
children]{.underline}]{.mark}," she raised. "We know that protecting and
empowering children requires coordination and collaboration at all
levels -- from the community up to global level. We can't do it alone --
no one can. We must all play our part," she added.

"In the Central African Republic (CAR), about 70% of the country is
controlled by armed groups," highlighted Nathalie Ben Zakour Man, Senior
Child Protection Advisor for the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in
CAR (MINUSCA). "It is crucial to constantly talking to the armed groups,
maintaining the dialogue and keeping the communication lines open."
Thanks to this ongoing dialogue and strong advocacy on the ground and at
different levels, 11,429 children (30% girls) have been separated from
the armed groups in the Central African Republic since 2014.

UNICEF Representative Jean-François Basse underlined the importance of
changing the way we talk about protecting children in armed conflict by
focusing not only on the recruitment and use of children, but on all six
grave violations and on reintegration. "Releasing children is important
but the reintegration of children is equally important," he plead.

Ezequiel Heffes from Geneva Call, an organization working closely with
armed non-State actors to promote respect for international humanitarian
norms in armed conflict, reminded that the engagement on child
protection issues should be ongoing and not only during active conflict.
"Engagement should continue beyond the conflict, in negotiating peace
agreements, for example," he said.

A point echoed by the Permanent Representative of Uruguay to the UN in
Geneva, H.E. Amb. Ricardo González Arenas, in his closing remarks.
"Child protection must be part of any comprehensive strategy aimed at
preventing and resolving conflicts with a view to sustainable peace.
That is why child protection issues should be included in peace
processes from its very early stages, duly taking into account the best
interest of the child," he said.

#### Protecting children should be an imperative of international peace

Tonderai W. **Chikuhwa 12**, in New York as senior program officer in
the United Nations Office for Children and Armed Conflict. He advocates
Security Council for stronger protection measures for children, and is
working to implement a global mechanism to monitor and report on grave
child rights violations in these and other conflict zones - From UN,
5/31/12 Protecting Children in Armed Conflicts as a New Imperative of
International Peace and Security,
<https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1520&context=macintl>
page 52-53 Gabe

Chikuhwa affirms that, "[[**protecting children** in armed conflicts
is]{.mark} a new [**imperative** of international **peace and
security**]{.mark}."]{.underline} He suggests that [[protecting the
child exceeds the duty towards the vulnerable populations in a
society]{.mark}, but is an imperative for global peace and
security.]{.underline} If the [[**protection** of **children** is an
**end in itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}, without reducing it to a means,
[[this end in itself generates another end]{.underline}]{.mark} that [is
[world peace and global security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Tonderai Chikuhwa's presentation, first of all, inscribes the
[[**protection** of the **child** within the **deontological ethics**
that emerge through the **notion** of the
**"imperative**]{.mark}.]{.underline}" But at the same time, [if the
protection of the child is not realized as a goal, we will not have
international security.]{.underline} Thus, a child rights that is linked
to the context of the family and the nation finds itself in an
international world. We should recall that the implication of the United
Nations in the protection of the child has moved the notion of human
rights from a pious wish, from a simple declaration of Human Rights, to
the domain of international law. It is worth appreciating as well the
creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC), according to the
Rome statute. Military operations of the United Nations are no longer on
the wishful level of overseeing a ceasefire and putting themselves
between two belligerent parties. [United Nations soldiers no longer
hesitate to engage in combat in order to protect civilian lives. If a
"strategic peacekeeping operation" is justified by its goal of
protecting human rights, then peace and national security become the
stakes of military intervention.]{.underline} As Chikuhwa points out so
well, "[the Security Council and the United Nations system as a whole
recognize that the grave violations being perpetrated against children
in the context of war constitute a legitimate threat to the maintenance
of international peace and security."]{.underline} It appears, then,
[that the [protection of the child in armed conflicts]{.mark} has become
[one of the basic rights,]{.mark} which means [it is an essential path
to enjoying international peace and security]{.mark}.]{.underline} 1
This shift in the United Nations mandate therefore involves moral and
legal considerations.

Tonderai Chikuhwa emphasizes the United Nations' engagement along four
axes: • The changing character of modern warfare and critical child
protection themes; • Locating children on the United Nations peace and
security agenda; • Children and armed conflict as an operational
priority of the Secretary-General and the United Nations Secretariat; •
and, finally, progress in the protection of children.

[War increasingly occurs inside of states.]{.underline} Such a war leads
to a gray zone between spaces of living, or safe zones, and spaces of
combat. Chikuhwa reminds us that, "new tactics of war, the absence of
clear composition, motivations and character, are complicated matters."
It follows that [such a context does nothing to protect a civilian or a
child in a "safe" area]{.underline}. This form of total war shakes the
core of international humanitarian law, which is based on the
distinction between combatants and civilians, as well as the principle
of proportionality in the use of force. [We observe that [**terrorism**,
and paradoxically the **war on terrorism**, does **not spare
children**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I will return shortly to the question
of children in detention.

The response of the United Nations on the protection of the child has
taken several faces and has engaged the United Nations through nearly
all of its structures[. [The protection of the child constitutes an
essential element of world peace]{.mark}]{.underline} insofar as it
engages the capacities and structures of the Security Council. One of
the consequences has been eight Security Council resolutions, as well as
other measures, such as the entrance of the child within the mandate of
peacekeeping operations. We should note as well that the work of
monitoring, reporting, and regime compliance can lead to legal sanctions
through the International Criminal Court for any act relating to, as
outlined by Chikuhwa, the "Killing or maiming of children, recruiting or
using child soldiers, attacks on schools or hospitals, rape or other
grave sexual violence against children, abduction of children, and
denial of humanitarian access for children."

Finally, in what he calls "progress in the protection of children,"
Chikuhwa emphasizes the importance of the ICC institution after the Rome
agreement and other international legal systems. The arrest of people
accused of using child soldiers is an act that can put an end to the
cycle of impunity. The cases presented here are those of Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo, Charles Taylor, the Côte d\'Ivoire, and the Sudan. Please note
that Charles Taylor is being prosecuted by the Special Court for Sierra
Leone (and Milosovic was prosecuted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia)

#### Recurrence of conflicts are more likely due to child soldiering -- [economic instabilities]{.underline} make recruitment easier, [PTSD]{.underline} and [aggression]{.underline} increase post-conflict instability

Roos **Haer 15**, assistant professor of International Relations at
Leiden university, et al. 5/11/15, "Child soldiers as time bombs?
Adolescents' participation in rebel groups and the recurrence of armed
conflict," https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066115581910

First, compared to children who have not been recruited by rebel groups,
[former [child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} are more likely to
[[experience economic disadvantages due to]{.mark} a [lack of
education]{.mark} after a conflict has ceased.]{.underline} The
[[resulting]{.mark} economic [weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} in
post-conflict states [[may then motivate the recurrence of
fighting.]{.underline}]{.mark} This argument belongs to the willingness
cluster of the theoretical framework on conflict recurrence, but also
includes elements of opportunity as former child soldiers already have
the skills for and are 'acquainted with' violent conflict. Brett and
McCallin (1998: 134), for instance, suggest that [former child
soldiers]{.underline} often [find themselves alienated from the
traditional means of livelihood as they never had the opportunity to
obtain the skills that underpin the economic bases of their communities
once they lay down weapons.]{.underline} Consequently, economic issues
due to a lack of education weigh especially heavily on former child
soldiers (Wessells, 2006: 202).3 Similarly, Blattman and Annan (2010)
show that rebels' [child soldier recruitment in Uganda had a negative
impact on former child soldiers]{.underline}' (post-conflict) education
and earnings [due to the lack of civilian schooling.]{.underline}4
According to these scholars, this education deficit impedes
labour-market success: while former child soldiers are just as likely to
be employed, they are half as likely to be engaged in skilled work, and
they earn wages that are lower by a third. The fact that former child
soldiers in particular suffer economically is also confirmed by research
on the challenges that former child soldiers faced in Mozambique and El
Salvador (e.g. Boothby et al., 2006; Santacruz and Arana, 2002).

In other words, [[former child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[have
no skills]{.mark} other than killing and being able to fieldstrip
weapons]{.underline} (Singer, 2006: 111), [and future life prospects are
dimmed for them in the wider region.]{.underline}
[[This]{.mark}]{.underline} may significantly [[raise the
willingness]{.mark} of former child soldiers [to start fighting again
since]{.mark} recruitment costs are reduced]{.underline} (from the
perspective of the rebel group) [and [rejoining]{.mark}]{.underline} a
rebel group might [[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} at least [[access to
basic necessities and supplies]{.mark},]{.underline} such as food,
shelter and so on, [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps even [a higher
[income]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Barnitz, 1997; Honwana, 2006;
Wessells, 2010). A Liberian child soldier, for example, told Human
Rights Watch (2004, quoted in Wessells, 2006: 168):

\[f\]or a while, I did some small jobs around Monrovia, but there was
not much to do and I could not afford to go back to school. So two years
ago, I decided to join the Liberians United for Reconciliation and
Democracy (LURD). I figured I was better to fight and try to get
something, than hang around town doing nothing.

As such, rejoining rebel groups might be the only viable outside option
that former child soldiers have in post-conflict societies.

Second, and reinforced, in fact, by the preceding argumentation on
economic and educational disadvantages, [child]{.underline} soldiering
might cause [psychological harm]{.underline} in a way that [can have
severely negative consequences for post-conflict stability]{.underline}
(Freud and Burlingham, 1943; Masten and Nyaran, 2012). Typically, former
[child combatants have undergone and]{.underline}/or [carried out
shocking and disturbing violent actions]{.underline} (Barnitz, 1997;
Machel, 1996). Due to the fact that they are young, [the
effect]{.underline} of these events [on children's psyches is magnified
as they occur]{.underline} during a period [when personalities are being
formed and]{.underline} in which [the brain and its functions are still
in development. Traumatic experiences in these]{.underline} sensitive
[periods]{.underline} might [have an especially negative impact on
development]{.underline}, either [because the child is particularly
responsive at that time]{.underline} or because the brain is becoming
'programmed', that is, it adapts to the new information and will
subsequently filter all new information on the basis of these changes
(Masten and Narayan, 2012; Perry, 1997). Perry et al. (1995: 290)
formulate it even more strongly: 'experiences can change the nature of
the brain, but experiences during critical periods of early childhood
organize brain systems'.

[[Due to]{.underline}]{.mark} children's
[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or lack of coping mechanisms,
these [[traumatic events]{.mark}]{.underline} might
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[in]{.mark} affective
blindness or]{.underline} in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
([[PTSD]{.underline}]{.mark}) (Perry, 1997).5 PTSD is a psychiatric
disorder that was first associated with battle fatigue among soldiers
during the First and Second World Wars. [It may lead to both
[physical]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. severe headaches, stomach pain,
sleep disorders) [[and mental symptoms]{.underline}]{.mark} (depression,
anxiety, high levels of aggression, extreme pessimism or a limited
capacity to accept frustration), [[which]{.mark}]{.underline}
particularly [[impair]{.mark} former child soldiers' [ability to
function]{.mark}]{.underline} in [day-to-day]{.underline} living, as
compared with adults and children who have not been recruited by armed
groups (see also Singer, 2006: 194).6 In other words, traumatic
experiences during childhood increase the risk of developing a variety
of neuropsychiatric symptoms in adolescence and adulthood (see Perry et
al., 1995). Perry (1997) and Masten and Narayan (2012) provide good
overviews of how traumatic events influence neurological development and
how these experiences influence the subsequent emotional, behavioural,
cognitive and social functioning of children.

[One]{.underline} of the most worrying [symptom]{.underline}s [connected
to [children's war participation]{.mark} is]{.underline} a supposed
[[increase]{.mark} in]{.underline} their level of
[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, as compared with adults and children
who have not fought for an armed group, once a conflict has ceased (see
Cohn and Goodwin-Gill, 1994). Within armed groups, [[child
soldiers]{.mark} are especially susceptible to [learn]{.mark}ing
[aggressive behaviour by observing and imitating
others]{.mark}]{.underline} (Berkowitz, 1993; Schauer and Elbert, 2010;
Singer, 2006: 193f). As Dickson-Gómez (2002: 350) states: '[these
children are constantly surrounded by extreme levels of violence, that
violence therefore becomes normalized']{.underline}. As a result of this
normalization of violence, [former [child soldiers often resolve
conflicts violently in a post-conflict environment]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Schauer and Elbert, 2010: 335). Magambo and Lett (2004), for instance,
report that [former child soldiers in Northern Uganda applied physical
violence to resolve conflicts and that they were not able to think of
any non-violent alternatives, reflecting an absence of adequate social
skills.]{.underline} These necessary skills are also not always acquired
after a conflict ends since these children often encounter broken family
networks that could have provided a better regulation of the use of
violence and would have helped them to settle in a more peaceful,
institutionalized civil life (Steenkamp, 2005).

#### The existence of child soldiers undermines global security, state building, and foreign aid 

Mary-Jane **Fox 04**, PhD from the Department of Peace and Conflict
Research at Upsaala University in Sweden and professor at Georgetown
University in the Department of Government, December 2004, "Girl
Soldiers: Human Security and Gendered Insecurity," pages 465-467,
doi:[10.1177/0967010604049523](https://doi.org/10.1177/0967010604049523)

THE TOPIC OF CHILD SOLDIERS has received wide exposure in recent years,
[though until recently this appeared to rest on the [assump- tion that
all child soldiers were boys]{.mark}]{.underline}. The girl soldiers who
existed among their ranks were little acknowledged or noticed, even
though they are currently estimated to comprise approximately between
one-tenth and one- third of all child soldiers (Mazurana & McKay, 2004:
115)1 and have been found to exist in almost all non-state political
armed groups. [Nevertheless, the [study of girl soldiers still falls
within the larger issue of child soldiers,]{.mark} primarily because
both boy and girl soldiers legally belong to the special category of
[minors or children,]{.mark} and as such [are entitled to **specific
rights and protections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, girls are
empirically found along with boy soldiers and share many of the same
experiences. [However, it is clear there is an [additional and
**disturbing gendered component** to the girls' experiences, and this
has increasingly demanded more attention.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In addition to being an affront to and a departure from established
norms, [the [very existence of armed minors]{.mark} also [raises
security concerns]{.mark} -- ranging from their being considered a
military threat to their **[representing a breach in the security that
states are expected to provide]{.mark}** for individuals and
society.]{.underline} Although attempts have been made to argue the
former interpretation, this article is more concerned with the latter.2
But whether there is a security perspective that offers a more
theoretically informed understanding of the special circumstances of
girl soldiers has not been previously discussed. In fact, although legal
and empirical reporting on the topic abounds, [there have been few
attempts to conceptualize or attach theory of any kind to the subject of
either child soldiers or girl soldiers, and so both topics have remained
in a state of empirical simplicity.]{.underline} Yet, even though it is
still early days in the empirical study of girl soldiers, theoretically
guided research would not only provide direction to what would otherwise
amount to a panoply of data, but would also contextualize those data and
suggest how they have meaning, particularly in regard to related issues.
At present, how- ever, the theoretical shortcomings in studies of child
soldiers are particularly apparent in literature specializing in
politics and conflict, and the articles that have appeared have tended
to be rhetorical or iterative, or have offered limited analysis.3 [Part
of the reasoning behind this might stem from a desire to keep the topic
apolitical, since it essentially deals with minors and child rights.
However, given that [this is an issue that should be]{.mark} of [great
concern to international and regional]{.mark} peacekeeping [forces,
post-conflict statebuilding]{.mark}, development [aid policy]{.mark},
[and]{.mark}, of course, [security]{.mark}, keeping it swept under an
apolitical carpet does not appear to be sound.]{.underline} This is not
to say that research does not exist: working papers and other
unpublished reports are diffuse, but they exist within a specialized
circle and are not subject to the same scrutiny that published works
endure. Since this is a growing global phe- nomenon that has an impact
on and has been affected by international legal instruments, has earned
its own Special Representative to the Secretary General of the UN, and
has been the focus of myriad reports on human rights and military
matters, the need for systematic analysis and theoretical devel- opment
is clear.

As a step towards bridging the empirical--theoretical gap, [this article
investigates the existence of [girl soldiers]{.mark} in terms of its
[represent]{.mark}ing **[a signifi- cant gap in the security that states
are expected to provide]{.mark}** for their people. Since the [issues
encompassing]{.mark} both [child soldiers]{.mark} in general and girl
soldiers in particular are the **[selfsame issues that underpin a human
security]{.mark}** per- spective, the article attempts to establish a
preliminary **[link between the insecurity of girl soldiers and human
security thinking]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although the con- cept of
human security has its share of detractors, it is not without merit and
may well lead towards a more focused and informed analysis of empirical
reality.

Children and armed conflict --- complex issues and gendered perceptions
The [use of the expression 'child soldier' raises a number of issues,
not least because it captures the essence of some narratives, in
particular that of western humanitarian organisations of 'child
soldiers' as inextricably linked to postcolonial wars in which [child
soldiers, are]{.mark} perceived as solely **[vulnerable and
exploited]{.mark}**]{.underline} (War child; Child soldiers; Invisible
children). Such [a narrative has influenced the manner in which
international criminal law understands and defines child soldiers to the
detriment of the more specific gendered experiences, in particular of
girl child soldiers]{.underline}. Defining child soldiers It is
difficult to give a current and up-to-date figure of child soldiers
engaged in armed conflict. [UNICEF estimates that 300,000 soldiers under
the age of 18 are fighting in conflicts around the world. Governmental
armed groups and rebel forces have recruited children in conflicts
occurring in parts of Latin America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East,
in countries such as Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, Colombia,
India, Iraq, Occupied Palestinian Territories, Philippines, Sri Lanka,
Sudan and Thailand]{.underline} (Annual Report of the Secretary General
(2012)). Historical accounts of wars inform us that children have played
a variety of roles to assist the war effort, but not necessarily in the
manner in which children were used in armed conflicts of Sierra Leone
and DRC. In the past, children did not necessarily actively participate
in hostilities. [In some cases, [children were trained]{.mark} to
prepare them [as adult soldiers.]{.mark} In Africa, Shaka, the warrior
king and founder of the Zulu nation introduced a military organisation
that included **six-year old boys** as apprentice soldiers]{.underline}
(Knight, 2006). In other cases, children were used in supporting roles.
During the Crusades, children from the age of twelve were used as
military aids at the service of the crusaders (Wise, 1978, p. 5).
However, at times children did participate in hostilities. During the
American Civil War, children were actively involved in the conflict
(Gates & Reich, 2009, p. 93). Johnny Clem was ten-years old when he ran
away from home to become a drummer boy in the second Michigan regiment.
He became famous for exchanging his drum for a gun to shoot a
confederate colonel during the battle of Shiloh (Arlington National
Cemetery Website). Particularly [towards the end of the Second World
War, Japan, Russia and Nazi Germany used child soldiers in their fight
against each other when their manpower was dwindling]{.underline}. For
instance, as the war went on, [boys drafted into the Hitler Youth
Brigades participated actively in combat]{.underline} (Fass, 2013, p.
151). History therefore suggests that children, more specifically boys,
take part in war. They have fulfilled multiple roles in aid of the war
effort, a fact which was accepted in most societies until relatively
recently. It is therefore not the case that children\'s participation
only occurs in the more recent conflicts (Rosen, 2005, pp. 9--11).
However, a [distinguishing factor is that [children\'s participation
in]{.mark} modern [conflict is]{.mark} extremely **[violent and
destructive]{.mark}** and [that children are used to fragment
communities]{.mark} [and **carry out atrocities**]{.mark}, as
[illustrated by]{.mark} the examples of **[Sierra Leone and
DRC]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [From the beginning of Sierra Leone\'s
**civil war** in 1991 children were **forced to contribute to the war**
effort by both sides to the conflict: the rebel force Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) and the pro-government militia,
Kamajors.]{.underline} The SCSL has charged all nine of its original
defendants with the war crime of recruiting and using child soldiers and
so far five accused have been convicted of this crime (AFRC cases, 2007;
ICC, Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC-01/04-01/06-2901, decision
on sentence pursuant to Article 76 of the Statute, & 10 July, 2012;
SCSL, 2007a; SCSL, 2009 March 2). The Court found, in particular, that
the former Liberian president Charles Taylor, who 92 S. Mouthaan /
Women\'s Studies International Forum 51 (2015) 91--100 was never on the
battlefield of Sierra Leone, had used Liberian military capabilities to
strengthen the RUF operating in Sierra Leone and encourage rebels in
their campaign of terror, including the use of children younger than 15
as soldiers (ICC, Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo,
ICC-01/04-01/06-2901, decision on sentence pursuant to Article 76 of the
Statute, & 10 July, 2012, § 150). The Charles Taylor judgement
highlights that the recruitment of children in Sierra Leone served a
dual purpose. It was a way of pursuing a policy of criminal campaign
against Sierra Leonean civilians, victimising children and their entire
families. In turn, the children, once associated with the armed groups,
were used as instruments to commit atrocities and further this policy.
[Similarly, [in the]{.mark} Democratic Republic of [Congo]{.mark} (DRC),
all armed parties to the conflict count children in their ranks. Thomas
[Lubanga]{.mark} was the leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots, a
rebel group. He [encouraged children]{.mark}, including children under
the age of 15 years, [to join the army]{.mark}]{.underline}. To advance
the cause of the Hema ethnic group to gain control over land and
resources in the gold-rich Ituri region situated in northeast DRC,
[[girls and boys were forced to **carry**]{.mark} **[arms, kill and
maim, burn]{.mark} down [villages]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} to [submit to
**sexual slavery**]{.mark} or other forms of abuse.]{.underline} In the
Lubanga judgement, the ICC took into account the position of authority
held by Thomas Lubanga within the Union of Congolese Patriots (UCP) and
the Forces Patriotiques de Libération du Congo (FPLC) and his essential
contribution to the common plan that resulted in these crimes against
children (ICC, Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC01/04-01/06-2901,
Decision on Sentence pursuant to Article 76 of the Statute, & 10 July,
2012, Section 97). The ICC found Thomas Lubanga guilty of recruiting
children under the age of 15 as child soldiers and using them to
participate actively in hostilities between 2002--2003 (ICC, Prosecutor
v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC-01/04-01/06-2901, Decision on Sentence
pursuant to Article 76 of the Statute, & 10 July, 2012, Section 97). The
symbolic value of the SCSL and ICC judgements expresses a firm
international commitment that wherever possible those most responsible
for committing this war crime will be prosecuted. The SCSL\'s prosecutor
Brenda Hollis stated when she commented on the conviction for recruiting
and using child soldiers: "[[Children were taken from their
families]{.mark}, and not only used to fight, but also to commit crimes
against their fellow Sierra Leoneans. [This **robbed**]{.mark} **these
[children of]{.mark} their [childhood]{.mark}**, and the judges have
sent a clear message that this will never be tolerated".]{.underline}
\[SCSL Press Release SCSL (2012)\] 'Child soldiers' is the term commonly
used to describe children involved in recent modern armed conflicts.
[The term 'child soldier' however is problematic. In the first instance,
it assumes that a child soldier can be loosely defined as any child
involved in a regular army, a rebel armed force or group regardless of
whether their involvement is through conscription, is forced or
voluntary, and regardless of motivations, geography, cultures and
ideologies. But [the realities of child soldiers are]{.mark} more
[complex]{.mark}.]{.underline} What being a child soldier entails will
vary from conflict to conflict, from armed force to armed force and from
child to child, as illustrated by the armed conflicts in Sierra Leone
and the DRC. [In addition, the term 'child soldier' generates a paradox
by combining the vulnerable and innocent child with the extreme violence
associated with armed conflict and armed forces]{.underline}. As
questioned by Honwana (2007), p. 33 & p. 69, how can one be at the same
time a child and a soldier? Childhood tends to suggest innocence and
defenselessness. The term "soldiers", on the other hand, broadly refers
to members of an organised armed group taking active part in hostilities
and is suggestive of violence. [The two terms together leave us with a
narrative in which children\'s vulnerability and the need for protection
is linked to extreme violence.]{.underline} The UNICEF (2007) suggests
using the alternative terminology to 'child soldiers'. Instead it refers
to 'children associated with armed forces and armed groups' (UNICEF,
2007). Although quite a mouthful, this expression denotes a better
understanding of the variety of experiences of children involved in
armed groups. Even though the Paris Principles are a non-binding
instrument, it has considerable influence, is cited by international
criminal tribunals and may in time become international law and thus
strengthen the protection of children from armed conflict. Western
humanitarian organisations in particular, whilst raising awareness about
children affected by armed conflict, specifically emphasise the
innocence and victimhood of children participating in armed conflict and
the extreme violence to which they are exposed. Of course, western
notions of the nature of childhood, not least concerning spoilt
innocence, can be critiqued. This simplifies our understandings of child
soldiers in that children are only seen through the lens of victimhood
and never as active agents or even successful resisters. Similar
narratives can be found in court proceedings. In the opening statement
of the Prosecutor in the Lubanga trial children were presented as
defenceless: ["[They **cannot forget the beatings**]{.mark} they
suffered, they cannot forget [the terror]{.mark} they felt and the
terror they inflicted; they cannot forget [the sounds of]{.mark} their
[machine guns; they **cannot forget**]{.mark} **that [they
killed]{.mark}**; they cannot forget [that **they raped and**]{.mark}
**that they [were raped]{.mark}**]{.underline}". \[Moreno-Ocampo
(2009)\] To emphasise [the vulnerability of children in this manner can
be explained by the need to secure a conviction]{.underline} and an
account of the dire conditions that these child soldiers find themselves
in, particularly since demobilisation, will assist. However, such a
portrayal can also work to the detriment of child soldiers called as
witnesses. [[Their youth, vulnerability and trauma]{.mark} can [lead to
questioning]{.mark} the veracity of [their testimony]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} **hamper [agency]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Furthermore, each
child exists within a set of individual varied realities, such as age,
gender, geography and culture.]{.underline} This makes it difficult to
determine the age at which an individual ceases to be a child and
becomes an adult. As seen in the judgements of the SCSL and the ICC, the
Statutes provide that it is a war crime for military commanders and
political leaders to recruit and use persons below the age of 15 (ICC
Statute, 2002, Article 8(2)(b)(xxvi), (e)(vii) and SCSL Statute, 2002,
Article 4). In contrast human rights instruments, such as the United
Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child (adopted 20 November
(1989)), define a child as "any human being below the age of 18 years"
(Article 1). Likewise the United Nations optional protocol to the S.
Mouthaan / Women\'s Studies International Forum 51 (2015) 91--100 93
convention on the rights of the child on the involvement of children in
armed conflict (adopted 25 May (2000)) makes it unlawful to recruit
individuals under the age of 18. However, for the purpose of children\'s
participation in armed conflict it is important to make a distinction
between prohibition as contained in human rights instruments and
international criminal sanction as implemented by international criminal
courts. The decision to set the age limit to 15 is controversial and
pressure is exercised, in particular by humanitarian organisations, to
extend the war crime to include persons below the age of 18. Some
countries resisted such a move. For instance, the US, the Netherlands
and France still permit the voluntary recruitment of minors into
national armed forces, albeit under strict legal conditions. The UK only
recently raised the military age of recruitment from sixteen to eighteen
and had sent soldiers under the age of 18 to the first Gulf War (Armed
Forces Act, 2006). It is therefore no surprise that it has proven so
difficult to stop the practice or simply to agree a universal age limit
for conscription. However, as Coomaraswamy indicated, recruitment into
armed forces or groups is against the best interests of a child (ICC,
Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC-01/04-01/06-2901, decision on
sentence pursuant to Article 76 of the Statute, & 10 July, 2012). For
the purpose of consistency and effective enforcement, both the
unlawfulness and criminal sanction must apply to the recruitment and use
of children under the age of 18. In addition, and as will now be
discussed, the definition and understanding of child soldiers adopted by
the ICC do not recognise girls\' experiences of armed conflict as
features of child soldiering. **[Between a rock and a hard place ---
girls amongst child soldiers]{.underline}** [There is very little data
available to accurately assess the historical and current roles that
girls fulfil in armed conflicts. Nevertheless, girls are also recruited
and used by commanders of armed groups and account for 40% of child
recruits]{.underline} (Save the Children Report, 2005). [The lack of
available data may be partly due to a gendered perception that girls do
not or cannot fight and thus girls\' participation in armed conflict has
not been monitored until recently. However, it is important to
understand [the roles girls fulfil within]{.mark} armed [groups]{.mark}
in order to provide girl child soldiers with appropriate legal
responses. Indeed many of the harms suffered by girl child soldiers are
[include]{.mark}d in the ICC Statute, 2002.]{.underline} [**[Rape,
sexual slavery,]{.mark} enforced [prostitution, forced
pregnancy]{.mark}**[, or any]{.mark} other [forms of sexual
violence]{.mark} are separate war crimes]{.underline} (Articles
8(2)(b)(xxii) & 8(2)(e)(vi)) and separate crimes against humanity
(Article 7(1)(g)). However, this category of gender-based crimes is
still under-investigated and under-prosecuted (Mouthaan, 2011). The ICC
still lacks a consistent approach towards the prosecution of
gender-based crimes. For instance, as will be examined, [in the Lubanga
trial, the prosecutor, in exercising his prosecutorial discretion,
decided not to include charges of crimes of sexual violence. As a
consequence, the harms suffered by girl child soldiers, including sexual
slavery, rape and other sexual crimes, were overlooked. An alternative
approach is to understand sexual violence as part and parcel of the
child soldering experience to be addressed within the war crime of
recruitment and use of child soldiers, rather than be prosecuted as a
separate war crime of sexual slavery or other form of sexual
violence]{.underline}. As argued by Askin (2005, p. 143), Bus (2002, p.
6 )and Oosterveld (2013, p. 70) more generally, the dual basis of
targeting within the crime needs to be recognised. Girls [are targets of
the war crime to recruit and use child soldiers]{.underline}. [In
addition [girls are]{.mark} also [targeted for]{.mark} sexual [abuse on
the basis of]{.mark} their [gender.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Prosecutor
in the Lubanga case could have resorted to a dual basis for the
prosecution of the crime and the underlying gendered nature of the
crime. The Court would then have been able to address whether there were
different ways in which girls and boys were used, thus addressing
underlying gendered aspects of the crime. For, [although there are
similarities between the experiences of boy and girl child soldiers,
girl child soldiers also present distinctive gendered
characteristics]{.underline}. Similarly to the recruitment of boys,
[there are a variety of reasons for girls to join, voluntarily or not,
an armed force or group. Socio-economic circumstances, political
ideology, poverty or breakdown of family and community structures,
social, economic and political emancipation may encourage girls to join
an armed force or group in order to acquire protection, healthcare, food
and shelter. Child soldier recruitment of both boys and girls also
presents a set of gender-specific features. Girls may join an armed
force or group to seek personal protection from domestic mistreatment or
sexual violence]{.underline} (Denov, 2007). [[Girls are]{.mark} also
more [**likely to be abducted** for domestic and sexual
purposes]{.mark}.]{.underline} More importantly, similarly to boy child
soldiers, girls may perform a variety of roles within armed groups.
[Girls may be used as active [combatants]{.mark} or for other military
purposes (Thomas, 2008). Boys and girls alike [may be used]{.mark}
indirectly in support roles [as **human shields**]{.mark}, messengers,
spies, cooks, porters [and **mine clearers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition, pre-existing gender inequality may be replicated, even
exacerbated, within the organisation of the armed group with girls being
used to perform socially constructed gendered roles such as carrying out
domestic tasks, including cooking and washing clothes, providing medical
care and run camps. In addition, [the [older girls are]{.mark} more
[vulnerable]{.mark} than the boys [to]{.mark} grave [**violations of
their human rights** through]{.mark} sexual violence, [sexual
exploitation]{.mark}, forced marriage, [and increased exposure
to]{.mark} sexually transmitted diseases such as
**[HIV/AIDS]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Human Rights Watch Report, 2003). As
Coomaraswamy stated, for girls, **[[recruitment is a]{.mark}
"particularly [horrendous experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (ICC,
Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC-01/04--01/06--2842T-223-ENG,
judgement pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, & 14 March, 2012, pp.
30--31). [Girl child soldiers are much more likely than boys to
experience sexual abuse]{.underline} (Sivakumaran, 2013, p. 19). In
Sierra Leone, recruited [[young girls were used]{.mark} to **fulfil the
role of "wife"** to rebel commanders; [and]{.mark} as a consequence of
related sexual activity [many became pregnant]{.mark} and faced higher
risks of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases]{.underline} (Denov,
2007, p. 20). Moreover, the boys\' experiences of recruitment and use
also contain gendered aspects. [They may suffer sexual violence or may
learn to be sexually violent towards civilians or colleagues. The
aftermath of participation in armed conflict is also not without its own
specific challenging gendered issues]{.underline}. In Sierra Leone,
girls were expected to re-adhere to traditional genderspecific roles
(Denov, 2007, p. 21). [Many [girl child soldiers,]{.mark} often with
their own children, [faced **rejection and social stigma**]{.mark} due
to cultural practices and beliefs for the roles they were expected to
perform as child soldiers]{.underline} (Denov, 2007, p. 163). 94 S.
Mouthaan / Women\'s Studies International Forum 51 (2015) 91--100
Therefore, child soldiering denotes a huge variety of experiences,
including the manner of recruitment, the violence before, during and
after joining an armed force or group, as well as the reasons for
joining. Drumbl (2012) warns against an all too simplistic
understanding, because this affects international responses to the issue
of child soldiers, in particular the definition of child soldiers. [Thus
far, international criminal law has given little thought to the role and
perspectives of girl child soldiers]{.underline} (Quénivet, 2008). [It
assumes that some of the roles of a sexual and domestic nature that
girls fulfil within armed forces and groups fall outside the scope of
military support and thus are excluded from the crime to recruit and use
children in armed conflict]{.underline}. This is not surprising as in
most societies women are seen to play a gendered role as a care giver
and not as a fighter, whereas norms of masculinity motivate men to
fight. The army is seen as a male-centred entity to which women have
restricted access. Although there are examples of women taking part in
combat ranging from Russia, the UK and Eritrea, in general frontline
face-to-face combat is precluded from women\'s remit, because they are
perceived to be too feminine, lacking the necessary physical and
psychological abilities. As such, military roles are an extension of
everyday gender roles in which women\'s roles are similarly undervalued.
However, the prohibition of recruitment and use of child soldiers are
one thing, but for this prohibition to be meaningful, international
criminal law must capture the essence of what it means to be a child
soldier. Child soldiers do not necessarily engage in direct combat. They
perform a variety of roles. It is therefore essential to understand
girl\'s experiences of armed conflict as part and parcel of child
soldiering[. The presence of girls and the multiple roles within
fighting forces is not insignificant. Thus **girls\' experiences and
perspectives should be considered as central** to the prohibition to
recruit and use child soldiers and not regarded as peripheral or
unwittingly or wittingly rendered invisible.]{.underline} In contrast to
international criminal law, international human rights law provisions
already aim at protecting children from the recruitment and use of child
soldiers, but also from discrimination and sexual violence, whilst
acknowledging the variety of uses of child soldiers, in particular the
gendered aspects. This would also be in accordance with the definition
of a child soldier in the UNICEF, 2007 that more accurately reflect the
reality lived by children recruited into and used in armed conflict.
According to the UNICEF, 2007 this includes: "Any person below 18 years
of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or
armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys
and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies or for
sexual purposes. It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has
taken a direct part in hostilities".

#### Child soldiering leads to a [vicious cycle of aggression]{.underline} and negative [youth development]{.underline}\-\--the plan's key to stop that

Second, and reinforced, in fact, by the preceding argumentation on
economic and educational disadvantages[, child [soldiering]{.mark} might
[cause **psychological harm**]{.mark} in a way that can have severely
negative consequences for post-conflict stability]{.underline} (Freud
and Burlingham, 1943; Masten and Nyaran, 2012). Typically, [former child
[combatants have]{.mark} undergone and/or [carried out **shocking and
disturbing**]{.mark} **violent [actions]{.mark}** (Barnitz, 1997;
Machel, 1996). Due to the fact that they are young, the [effect
of]{.mark} these [events on **children's psyches** is magnified]{.mark}
as they occur during a period when personalities are being formed and in
which the brain and its functions are still in development. **[Traumatic
experiences]{.mark}** in these sensitive periods might [have a]{.mark}n
especially **[negative impact on development]{.mark}**, either because
the child is particularly responsive at that time or because the brain
is becoming 'programmed', that is, it adapts to the new information and
will subsequently filter all new information on the basis of these
changes]{.underline} (Masten and Narayan, 2012; Perry, 1997). Perry et
al. (1995: 290) formulate it even more strongly: 'experiences can change
the nature of the brain, but experiences during critical periods of
early childhood organize brain systems'. [Due to children's
vulnerabilities or lack of coping mechanisms, these [traumatic
events]{.mark} might [result]{.mark}, for instance, [in **affective
blindness** or]{.mark} in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(**[PTSD]{.mark}**) (Perry, 1997).5 PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that
was first associated with battle fatigue among soldiers during the First
and Second World Wars. It may lead to both physical (i.e. severe
headaches, stomach pain, sleep disorders) and mental symptoms
(depression, anxiety, high levels of aggression, extreme pessimism or a
limited capacity to accept frustration), which particularly impair
former child soldiers' ability to function in day-to-day living, as
compared with adults and children who have not been recruited by armed
groups]{.underline} (see also Singer, 2006: 194).6 [In other words,
traumatic experiences during childhood increase the risk of developing a
variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms in adolescence and
adulthoo]{.underline}d (see Perry et al., 1995). Perry (1997) and Masten
and Narayan (2012) provide good overviews of how traumatic events
influence neurological development and how these experiences influence
the subsequent emotional, behavioural, cognitive and social functioning
of children. [[One of the]{.mark} most [worrying symptoms]{.mark}
connected to children's war participation [is]{.mark} a supposed
**[increase in]{.mark} their level of [aggression]{.mark}**, as compared
with adults and children who have not fought for an armed group,
[once]{.mark} a [conflict has ceased]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Cohn and
Goodwin-Gill, 1994). [Within armed groups, child [soldiers are]{.mark}
especially [susceptible to]{.mark} learning [aggressive
behaviour]{.mark} by observing and imitating others]{.underline}
(Berkowitz, 1993; Schauer and Elbert, 2010; Singer, 2006: 193f). As
Dickson-Gómez (2002: 350) states: '[these children are constantly
surrounded by extreme levels of violence, that **[violence]{.mark}
therefore [becomes normalized]{.mark}**']{.underline}. As a result of
this normalization of violence, [[former]{.mark} child [soldiers]{.mark}
often resolve conflicts violently in a post-conflict
environment]{.underline} (Schauer and Elbert, 2010: 335). Magambo and
Lett (2004), for instance, report that [former child soldiers [in
Northern Uganda applied]{.mark} physical [violence to resolve conflicts
and]{.mark} that they [were **not able to think of**]{.mark} **any
[non-violent alternatives]{.mark}**[, reflecting]{.mark} an [absence
of]{.mark} adequate **[social skills]{.mark}**. These necessary skills
are also not always acquired after a conflict ends since these children
often encounter broken family networks that could have provided a better
regulation of the use of violence and would have helped them to settle
in a more peaceful, institutionalized civil life]{.underline}
(Steenkamp, 2005). In sum, based on the youth-bulge literature, it is
especially [the youth that is more inclined to re-engage in
conflict]{.underline}. However, [given the fact that former child
soldiers are more aggrieved economically and psychologically, we expect
that this cohort is especially more willing and has more opportunities
to take up weapons again]{.underline}. Hence, '[[the **phenomenon of
child soldiers feeds upon itself'**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Singer, 2006:
109): conflict creates a new cohort of potentially traumatized former
child soldiers that lack any economic or education skills, which 'then
becomes a potential pool and catalyst for the next spate of violence'
(Singer, 2006: 109; see also Wessells, 1997). Put differently, [[due to
**economic**]{.mark} **and [educational disadvantages]{.mark}** [and
psychological harm]{.mark}, if children were involved in a previous
conflict, [we expect]{.mark} to observe a [higher willingness]{.mark}
and opportunity [to **resort again to violence**]{.mark}, perhaps even
if only when eventually grown up, which, in turn, is likely to increase
the risk of conflict recurrence]{.underline}.

### Violence

#### Child soldiers have long lasting psychological problems\-\--Suffer from sexual violence and manipulation

We Alleviate This Problem?,

Child soldiers are individuals, under the age of 18, who serve in
government forces and armed opposition groups. [A child can serve a
variety of roles in these groups, such as fighting in combat zones,
working in hospitality, and maintaining the upkeep of the bases through
activities like cooking and cleaning. Girls, more so than boys, are
often exposed to sexual violence.]{.underline}

The [immorality]{.underline} of these situations [lies in the fact that
[children are easily manipulated and coerced into participating in
military conflicts]{.mark}. Due to their vulnerability, trusting nature,
and lack of power, many children feel compelled to help those around
them.]{.underline} The [[exploitation of]{.mark} innocent [children to
become child soldiers is]{.mark} widely [recognized as]{.mark} one of
[the most morally deplorable practices across the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} Compounding the issue is the
[**[long-lasting psychosocial impacts]{.mark}** that the children
experience [from]{.mark} their [trauma]{.mark} in the
battlefield.]{.underline} Studies by psychologists suggest that
[after]{.underline} the [children serve in the military, the [large
majority]{.mark} of them are [diagnosed with anxiety,
**p**]{.mark}ost-**[t]{.mark}**raumatic **[s]{.mark}**tress
**[d]{.mark}**isorder, [and **depressive
disorders**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This report will focus on the unlawful
and deeply unethical recruitment methods that armed groups use to create
child soldiers. I will then focus on some of the main reasons that
children join regional armed combat groups and the long-lasting
psychosocial impacts of being a child soldier. Thereafter, I will focus
on the core strategies that international organisations are implementing
to reduce the number of child soldiers across the world.

Currently, [there are approximately 300,000 child soldiers across at
least fourteen countries globally. Children are combatants in almost
three-quarters of all conflicts globally]{.underline}, and girls make up
approximately 30% of them. However, boys and girls have different roles
within an armed military group. For instance, [boys are more likely to
be involved in armed conflict and in traditionally male roles, such as
cooking]{.underline}. On the other hand, [girls are often recruited as
child soldiers for sexual purposes, forced marriages, and for typical
female roles, such as cleaning. One former child soldier from Liberia
retold how she was raped multiple times.]{.underline} When she became
pregnant, she stated that boys repeatedly pushed on her stomach "to get
rid of the baby." After the war, [the [trauma]{.mark} the [girls
developed]{.mark} led them to be at an [**increased risk of further
sexual violence, stigmatization, and STIs** once they
left]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was seen in the Congo, where [[girls who
were raped during their time as child soldiers were isolated and shamed
by their families upon their return]{.mark}. As a result, many girls
chose to return back to militias in order to avoid such humiliating
stigma.]{.underline}

Gaining membership into a military group can be voluntary or
involuntary. [[Children can become soldiers involuntarily through
abduction, conscription, and being born into the armed group.]{.mark}
Abduction is the most common method of involuntary
recruitment.]{.underline} There are [many unlawful and unethical methods
that are continuously used to encourage child soldiers to participate in
military combat groups.]{.underline} Some of these include "threats,
intimidation and exhausting endurance training to physically and
emotionally break children down" in order to ensure that they will
comply with all orders from the terrorist group. While other child
soldiers want membership into military groups to evade poverty, to
protect their local community, or for other visceral psychological
reasons such as revenge, Accord (2016) has stated that those recruited
from voluntary means do it for push-and-pull reasons. Push factors
include poverty, lack of education and employment, and/or family
violence, whereas pull factors include seeking security, a sense of
belonging to an identity or ideology, and/or economic advantage.

There are myriads of different armed groups that recruit child soldiers
globally. According to CNN, ISIS currently has approximately 1,500 child
soldiers that have been recruited and trained to fight for the terrorist
group. For example, in Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) led by
Joseph Kony, carried out forced recruitment of children. Kony's
undertaking led to the abduction of approximately sixty to eighty
thousand of mainly male adolescents into the army. Another example of
involuntary conscription was shown in the bloody civil war in Sierra
Leone (1991-2002), where thousands of children were recruited to join
the Revolutionary United Front, the main rebel group in the war. Some of
the children joined on a voluntary basis, yet, many were recruited
through coercive and intimidating tactics. [Approximately 50% of the
children targeted and abducted were aged 15 or younger and as such, are
likely to have developed longer-term psychosocial problems.]{.underline}

A large majority of child soldiers who are involved in military
conflicts become affected with psychological disorders. This is seen in
Peru, where a group by the name of "Shining Path" recruited child
soldiers. [[Once a child gained membership, they were instructed to eat
**hearts, liver, and kidneys, and drink the blood of their victims** in
order to instill a hate for human life]{.mark}. These
experiences]{.underline} are vile and traumatic and often [lead to
long-lasting psychological symptoms that often present to clinicians as
PTSD.]{.underline} The strongest indicator of PTSD from former child
soldiers is physical violence, which can either involve witnessing forms
of it or participating in it. In a study by Klasen and associates (2011)
of former Ugandan soldiers with 330 participants, 33% had PTSD, 37% had
depression and 78% had Developmental trauma disorder (DTD). This study
found that symptoms of PTSD resulted from the trauma they were exposed
to during wartime. Whereas the symptoms exhibited by those who had a DTD
diagnosis came from a combination of experiences of family violence,
lack of social support, and depression.

According to the Child Soldiers International group, there are three
ways in which we can reduce the amounts and levels of harm to child
soldiers globally. One is to campaign to prevent child recruitment. The
others are to support better reintegration strategies of children into
their families and/or communities and also, to hold those who use
children for military purposes to account. The reintegration and
rehabilitation of those affected -- especially women -- often fails.
Women who are sexually violated during their time as a child soldier
often experience shame when they return home. One 16-year-old-girl
reported that it is "better to die there than come home and be
rejected." According to Child Soldiers International, if women are not
supported when they return to their home, they will return to the
militia and hence, reintegration will fail. This is one such example of
the importance of ensuring that former girl soldiers and their families
be given the appropriate education, vocational training, and medical
care to ensure they can live with security, welfare, and safety in the
long term.

Despite the best efforts of international organizations, [the use of
child soldiers is an omnipresent issue for many regions globally. Armed
military groups, such as ISIS are recruiting child soldiers at an
increasing rate. ISIS, alongside many other armed groups, acknowledge
that children are more easily exploited and manipulated.]{.underline}

In the meantime, the UN continues to appeal to the international
community to take more action to reduce the number of child soldiers
worldwide. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Children and Armed Conflict, Leila Zerrougui, also encourages all to
advocate for children to not belong to national security forces or
military combat groups. The trauma that children experience during
wartime or when they are involved in military conflict zones are
neverending. The large majority of child soldiers, who survive the
conflict struggle to assimilate back into their homes, experience
long-lasting, and trauma-induced psychological symptoms. As well, then
the child is able to return home, greater education is needed around the
stigmitization surrounding sexual and physical violence to protect the
child from returning to militias.

### Psychological Harm

#### Child soldiers suffer from PTSD, Personality changes, and social isolation

Konstanz, 3/18/10, The Psychological Impact of Child Soldiering,
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-5722-1_14

[[Motivations for child recruitment include]{.mark} children's [limited
ability to assess risks, feelings of invulnerability, and
shortsightedness.]{.mark} [Child soldiers]{.mark} are more often killed
or injured than adult soldiers on the front line.]{.underline} They
[[are less costly]{.underline}]{.mark} for the respective group or
organization than adult recruits, [because they receive fewer
resources]{.underline}, including less and smaller weapons and
equipment. From a different perspective, becoming a fighter may seem an
attractive possibility for children and adolescents who are facing
poverty, starvation, unemployment, and ethnic or political persecution.
In our interviews, former child soldiers and commanders alike reported
that [[children are more **malleable and adaptable**]{.mark}. Thus, they
are [easier to indoctrinate]{.mark}, as their moral development is not
yet completed and they tend to listen to authorities without questioning
them]{.underline}.

[[Child soldiers are]{.mark} raised [in an environment of **severe
violence**]{.mark}, experience it, and subsequently often commit
cruelties and atrocities of the worst kind. [This]{.mark}]{.underline}
repeated [[exposure to chronic and traumatic stress]{.mark} during
development [leaves the children with mental and related physical
ill-health,]{.mark} notably [**PTSD** and **severe personality
changes**.]{.mark} Such exposure also [deprives the child from]{.mark} a
[normal and healthy development and impairs their integration into
society]{.mark} as a fully functioning member]{.underline}. This chapter
presents in detail the cascade of changes that prove to be non-adaptive
in a peaceful society. Further, [ex-combatants [experience social
isolation]{.mark} arising [from]{.mark} a number of factors, which
include host [communities' negative attitudes towards]{.mark}
ex-combatants and [their psychological problems]{.mark} causing
difficulties in social interaction. The risk of re-recruitment is high
when ex-combatants fail to reintegrate economically and socially into
their civil host communities]{.underline}, which may cause substantial
economic development issues, and a new turn in the cycle of violence
becomes inevitable. We therefore conclude that the provision of
extensive mental health services needs to be an essential part of
demobilization and rehabilitation programs. This will improve the
individual's functioning, it will build capacity within the affected
community, and it may be designed to break the cycle of violence.

### Trans-Generational

#### Child soldiering has transgenerational effects that create a cycle of never-ending psychological problems\-\-- increased fear, child abuse, depression, hypersensitivity, and psychological mortality

Elisabeth **Schauer 10**, Professor of psychology at University of
Konstanz, 3/18/10, The Psychological Impact of Child Soldiering,
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-5722-1_14

[[Psychological]{.mark} exposure and [suffering]{.mark} from trauma [can
cripple]{.mark} individuals and [families]{.mark}, even [into the **next
generations**]{.mark}. After having experienced organized violence,
affected parents can leave an imprint in their grandchildren's
generation]{.underline} (Yehuda, Halligan, & Bierer, 2001). Concern
about consequences for offspring, whose mothers were stressed during
pregnancy, derives from evidence gained in experimental biology, as
intrauterine stress shows to affect neurodevelopment in animals, which
are thought to be relevant to cognition, aggression, anxiety, and
depression in humans (Seckl & Holmes, 2007). [Chronic [maternal stress
during pregnancy]{.mark}, for example, interrupts healthy regulation of
hormonal activity including cortisol, which easily crosses the placenta
during the first two trimesters]{.underline} (Phillips, 2007; Sandman,
Wadhwa, Chicz-DeMet, Porto, & Garite, 1999; Sandman et al., 1999;
Weinstock, 1997, 2005). Changed hormonal regulation then can promote a
range of emotional and cognitive impairments (Sapolsky, Krey, & McEwen,
1985; Sapolsky, Uno, Rebert, & Finch, 1990). While the genome, the DNA
sequence, remains unaffected by acute stress responses, its readability
(i.e. epigenetic alterations) may be manipulated by a variety of
conditions, notably stress hormones (Meaney, Szyf, & Seckl, 2007). [If a
pregnant mother is affected by severe and chronic stress, epigenetic
modifications in the child may [act as a molecular or cellular memory
that tune]{.mark} the offspring [for]{.mark} one or [several generations
for survival in a hostile environment, making generations more
vulnerable for mental illnesses]{.mark}, including suicide]{.underline}
(Szyf, McGowan, & Meaney, 2008). [The quality of how a mother is able to
attach to and care for her child alters the expression of genes in the
child that regulate behavioral and endocrine responses to stress, as
well as hippocampal plasticity and development.]{.underline} These
effects may contribute to the development of differences in stress
reactivity and certain forms of pathologic cognition.

[Literature shows that [boys]{.mark} and men [with war and combat
experiences are more likely to exhibit violent
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} (Begic & Jokic-Begic, 2001; Bryne & Riggs,
1996; Catani et al., 2008; Glenn et al., 2002). The [same can be
expected]{.underline} for men who have a history of [child soldiering.
In families where men show violent behavior against women, [children are
maltreated as well]{.mark}]{.underline} (Edleson, 1999; Levendosky &
Graham-Bermann, 2001). In fact, [[**domestic violence** against the
child's mother]{.mark} during the first 6 months of life [elevates the
risk of physical child abuse three times]{.mark}, while [doubling the
risk of emotional abuse]{.mark} and neglect [of the
child]{.mark}]{.underline} (McGuigan & Pratt, 2001). Additionally,
[babies born to traumatized and socially stressed mothers, which
certainly can include formerly abducted child-mothers]{.underline} (i.e.
women who gave birth to babies in captivity), [are born with a deformed
stress regulating system]{.underline} (HPA-a), which translates into
babies' higher and faster arousal peaks, [longer intervals of crying and
irritability, and impaired affect regulation]{.underline} (Sondergaard
et al., 2003). Such behavior by infants is a challenge for any new
parent, but is a major challenge for a parent who her/himself suffers
from a disorder of the trauma spectrum, has little or no social support
and lives in poverty. Parents of 'highly stressed' babies report less
confidence and joy in their role as caregivers and the phenomenon of
'negative reciprocity' starts to develop (Papousek & von Hofacker,
1998). In fact, research shows that [**[behaviourally inhibited
children]{.mark}**, who are fearful and have a tendency to withdraw,
were regarded by their mothers as hard to soothe and [received less care
and less maternal sensitivity as a result.]{.mark} This, in turn,
heightened the children's sensitivity to stress and changed their
internal stress-diathesis system towards a biased attention to
threat]{.underline} (Fox, Hane, & Pine, 2007)

A child with reduced abilities for affect regulation, in combination
with one or two traumatized primary caregivers, is a very great
potential risk constellation. [Internalized affects of violent and
neglectful caretaker models deform the psyche and can also imprint on
the next generation. As a result, the family suffers from heightened
levels of stress, and psychiatric symptoms can be evoked in people who
live with an individual who suffers from PTSD.]{.underline} Violence and
trauma at the time of parents' childhood may result in problematic
attachment relationships that have long-term consequences for mental
health and interpersonal relationships for their children. [[An
**intergenerational cycle of dysfunction** is set in
motion]{.underline}]{.mark} (Bowlby, 2004; Grossmann, Grossmann, &
Waters, 2005; Lewis, 1992; Qouta, Punamaki, & Sarraj, 2003; Smith,
Perrin, Yule, & Rabe-Hesketh, 2001; Solomon, 1988; Zuravin, McMillen,
DePanfilis, & Risley-Curtiss, 1996)

[The amount of stress encountered in early life sensitizes an organism
to a certain level of adversity; [high levels of early-life
stress]{.mark} may [result in hypersensitivity]{.mark} to stress later,
[as well as to adult depression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beyond epigenetic
factors, [[fearfulness and nurturance are transmitted from generation to
generation through maternal behaviour]{.underline}]{.mark} (Parent et
al., 2005). Traumatized parents are challenged in providing secure
attachment, because post-traumatic symptoms of emotional numbing might
be hindering emotional closeness. Symptoms of hyperarousal, such as
irritability, might make it even more challenging to regulate babies and
their own affect adequately. Parental sensitivity in pre-empting a
child's need might be impaired, and 'high expressed emotions' without
sufficient verbalization of the context can render a small child
helpless in understanding parental motivation and intention. It has been
shown that if children live in such unpredictable reward--punishment
environments, their psycho-physiological arousal is significantly
heightened and will over time lead to a changed
hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis. [Beyond coincidence, researchers
clearly note [higher rates of **psychiatric morbidity** in children of
survivors]{.mark}, compared with non-traumatized comparison
groups]{.underline} (Ben Arzi, Solomon, & Dekel, 2000; Bramsen, van der
Ploeg, & Twisk, 2002; Dekel & Solomon, 2006; Dirkzwager, Bramsen, Ader,
& van der Ploeg, 2005; Franciskovic et al., 2007; Solomon et al., 1992;
Weinstock, 1997).

A partner, father, or grandmother suffering from traumatization can
behave like a distant, fearful stranger, who cannot tolerate closeness
or emotional expression, even within the family unit. Survivor's intense
and bizarre way of self-expression in form of irritability, jumpiness,
or hypervigilance may be so extreme as to appear like paranoia and can
engender fear, confusion, and a sense of powerlessness in family members
(Al-Turkait & Ohaeri, 2008; MacDonald, Chamberlain, Long, & Flett,
1999). On the other hand, [children of survivors can be equally affected
by their parents' symptoms of numbing and avoidance, which are
associated with substantial decrements in parent--child relationship
quality and which prevent normal emotional expression and
closeness]{.underline} (Lauterbach et al., 2007). Consequently, children
are forced to operate within a domestic context in which intimacy, as
well as affect regulation, is severely impaired (Almqvist & Broberg,
2003). Avoidance symptoms seem to have an additional deleterious effect
on the parent--child relationship satisfaction. [Studies on fathers, who
have experienced numerous war events, show that [feelings of detachment
and numbing]{.mark} can [carry]{.mark} over [to their children, leading
to behavioural problems in the child]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ruscio,
Weathers, King, & King, 2002; Samper, Taft, King, & King, 2004). Based
on the vulnerability of surviving a war or growing up in a post-conflict
setting, children, in turn, might also become more vulnerable to forces
that incite violence (Somasundaram, 2002; Uppard, 2003).

### Cards that help with pathos 

#### Child soldiers are exposed to disabilities, mortality, abuse, etc.

Ayesha **Kadir 19,** pediatrician at Malmö Institute for Studies of
Migration, Diversity and Welfare, Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden,
Médecins Sans Frontières, Geneva, Switzerland et al., 2/11/19, "Effects
of armed conflict on child health and development: A systematic review"
<https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210071>

[[Children exposed to armed conflict suffer a]{.mark} broad [range of
injuries and illness]{.mark} that can be directly attributed to
conflict]{.underline} (Fig 3). One third (N = 52) of included studies
describe a range of physical injuries affecting all organ systems,
broadly classified as penetrating injuries, blunt trauma, crush injuries
and burns. Injuries were attributed to shelling, explosions, collapsing
buildings, gunshots, and motor vehicle crashes.

Among injured children who reach health facilities, penetrating injuries
are most common.\[25--39\] [[Penetrating head injury is the most
frequent form of head injury among children]{.mark} treated in military
combat facilities, accounting for 60--75% of all head injuries and
[carrying the highest mortality risk]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}28, 30, 32\]
This pattern of head trauma differs markedly from that observed in
peaceful settings, where blunt head trauma predominates. It is important
to note that the admission criteria for combat support hospitals, access
to military facility care, and care seeking behaviours of people living
in combat zones are likely to influence the findings in military
studies; Spinella et al documented that a child with a severe head
injury had sought care at five other hospitals before presenting to a
military facility.\[40\]

Reported mortality from trauma ranges from 2.6--18%,\[33--44\] and as
high as 24% in neurosurgical patients.\[30--32, 45\] Younger trauma
patients bear a significantly higher burden of mortality when compared
with older children and adults.\[40, 41\] No studies provided data on
mortality after transfer or discharge from health facilities.

While numerous case studies report children with traumatic amputations,
only one study examined the prevalence of disability among war-injured
children. This single facility retrospective chart [[review of 94
children with war-related injuries]{.underline}]{.mark} sustained during
the wars in Croatia and Bosnian and Herzegovina found that nearly
**[[40% of the children suffered permanent
disability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\[43\] No studies describe the
incidence or prevalence of childhood disability associated with armed
conflict or its long term effects on health, development, or life
opportunities.

Two studies document the effects of chemical or biological weapons on
children. Momeni and colleagues describe the clinical manifestations of
mustard gas exposure in a group of children during the Iran-Iraq
war.\[46\] The paper highlights the difference in presentation when
compared with adults, including earlier onset of symptoms, more frequent
pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms, and predominant face and neck
symptoms. Guha-Sapir and colleagues found that [children in the ongoing
conflict in Syria are twice as likely to die from chemical weapon
attacks as adults]{.underline} (OR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.69--2.63).\[47\]

Studies documenting the torture of children report a variety of torture
methods that children experienced and/or witnessed. [[These children
suffer physical injuries,]{.mark} a variety of somatic complaints,
enuresis, constipation[, **sleep disorders, and psychological
disorders**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}\[47--56\] A follow-up study
on children who were tortured or whose parents were tortured in Chile
found that both [[the prevalence and frequency of somatic **symptoms
increased over time** after resettlement]{.mark} in
Denmark]{.underline}.\[55\]

[Exposure to armed conflict is associated with a higher burden of
infectious, communicable, and noncommunicable diseases in
children]{.underline}. A global study of disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) associated with civil war found significantly reduced DALYs in
children under 14 years for all disease categories, with the most severe
reductions in the under 5 (U5) age group.\[57\] Diseases such as
malaria,\[58\] diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, and fever\[59\]
are more common and carry higher mortality.\[60\] A nationwide
cross-sectional study in Iraq after the first Persian Gulf War found
that age-adjusted mortality due to diarrhoea rose from 2.1 pre-war to
11.9 per 1000 person-years after onset of war.\[60\] [Pregnancy and
birth in conflict zones are also higher risk]{.underline}. A study in
Tuzla Canton, Bosnia, found significantly fewer live births, increased
preterm delivery, and low birth weight during wartime, which normalised
again after the war.\[61\] [[Displacement due to conflict is associated
with crowding]{.mark}, limited access to water and sanitation, and
increased risk of infectious [and communicable
diseases.]{.mark}]{.underline}[\[]{.mark}62--65\]

Studies on the effects of combat-related environmental exposures have
identified [an increased prevalence of birth defects and cancer, as well
as ongoing risk of injury due to unexploded ordnance]{.underline} (UXO).
The incidence of structural heart defects in Kuwaiti infants rose
significantly after the first Persian Gulf War to levels exceeding the
international incidence.\[66\] While the mechanism for this jump in
prevalence cannot be identified by the study design, the authors suggest
that war-related environmental pollution may play a role. This
hypothesis is supported by a large study of birth defects in children of
US Gulf War Veterans using active case ascertainment.\[67\] Conversely,
an earlier review of military health records suggests no increased
incidence of birth defects among the infants of US Gulf War
Veterans.\[68\]

[A study in Iraq found a significantly increased rate of leukaemia,
particularly amongst younger children]{.underline}.\[69\] Similarly, Wen
and colleagues found significantly increased risk of AML in children
whose fathers reported having served in Vietnam or Cambodia.\[70\] AML
risk was further elevated if fathers reported two or more tours.

Landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) remain a significant risk for
children during conflict and long after combat has ended.\[71--80\] The
burden of injury due to UXO varies by conflict, however children account
for approximately half (42--55%) of injuries from UXO in Afghanistan,
Nepal, Eritrea, and Iran.\[71, 73, 74, 77, 80\] The pattern of injuries
in children is similar across settings; children more often suffer upper
body injuries sustained while playing, going to school, or tending
animals.\[71--74, 78, 79\]

[[Whilst the burden of disease increases due to conflict, access to
health care becomes more difficult]{.mark}. Children in areas affected
by conflict are less likely to receive vaccinations]{.underline} \[81,
82\] [and conflicts may contribute to outbreaks of vaccine preventable
diseases such as the polio outbreaks during the conflicts]{.underline}
in Nigeria and Angola \[83, 84\] and a rubella outbreak in Bosnia and
Herzegovina after hostilities had ended.\[85\] Combat may also hamper
vaccination campaigns during disease outbreaks.\[84\] Several studies
have reported that pregnant women displaced due to war were less likely
to receive prenatal care or deliver with the assistance of a skilled
birth attendant.\[61, 82, 86, 87\] Studies from the former Yugoslavia
describe drastic reductions in the number of health personnel \[88\] and
conditions where children with chronic conditions had less frequent
access to medical care and experienced worsening of their
condition.\[89\]

[[Conflict also prevents children from going to school and lowers their
overall educational attainment]{.underline}]{.mark}. A large time-series
cross-sectional study examining the impact of war in sub-Saharan Africa
(1950--2010) found that [armed conflict significantly reduced school
attendance for both boys and girls, and with an inverse correlation
between military expenditure and school attendance]{.underline}.\[90\]
Similar findings have also been described in Palestine,\[91\]
Tajikistan\[92\] and Colombia.\[93\] The Colombian study findings
suggested this may have a long-term effect---adults in areas affected by
conflict had lower educational outcomes.

[Children whose [caregivers have been exposed to armed conflict are at
increased risk for child abuse and
neglect]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Studies from Timor-l'Este,
Uganda, and in Syrian refugees in Lebanon found that [caregivers who
suffer from stress or have a mental health disorder related to their
exposure to armed conflict have higher rates of child-reported and
caregiver-reported child abuse]{.underline}.\[87, 94, 95\] The Ugandan
study findings suggest that war exposure and subsequent trauma are
mediating factors for violence against children. Studies among U.S.
military personnel have documented increased rates of physical abuse and
neglect in the children of veterans, both during the period of
deployment and after return.\[96, 97\] A large study of Californian
children in civilian public schools found that the children of US
military personnel have higher rates of experiencing violence in school
and are more likely to carry a weapon.\[98\]

Important changes in societal structure, norms, and roles take place in
populations affected by conflict. Children may assume adult
responsibilities, including providing for their families and caring for
ill or disabled parents.\[99--101\] [Several studies described changes
in sexual behaviour, with earlier sexual debut and child
marriage]{.underline}.\[102--105\] [Displacement and separation from
family may place children at increased risk for exploitation, high risk
sexual behaviour, sexually-transmitted illness, and teen
pregnancy]{.underline}.\[104\] Two studies from Uganda describe
particular barriers in access to information and health care for
adolescents that further compound their health risks.\[104, 105\]

While numerous studies document the multiple kinds of war-related
violence that children witness, no studies examine the effect of these
exposures on child motor and psychosocial development. Two studies
examined the influence of war-related trauma on children's stress
physiology. Feldman et al. found that war-exposed children had altered
cortisol and salivary amylase response to stress.\[106\] The same study
also found that children's baseline cortisol levels were independently
related to maternal baseline cortisol, mother-child relationship, and
maternal mental health. Similarly, the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study
described altered stress physiology in children who were separated from
their parents for a period during WWII.\[107\] Two other studies on the
same birth cohort found that separated girls had significantly earlier
onset of menarche than non-separated girls, and that children separated
from their parents in early childhood had lower scores on intelligence
testing, respectively.\[108, 109\]

Studies from Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
and El Salvador document the extreme kinds of violence that [children
experience]{.underline} during association with armed forces or groups,
including [being forced to watch and take part in killing, cannibalism,
rape, child marriage, and sexual slavery.]{.underline}\[52, 99,
110--114\] Three studies also describe the process of indoctrinating
children and methods used to control and isolate them. The children in
these studies describe regular physical and psychological abuse,
torture, and the normalisation of violence.\[52, 113, 115\] In the words
of one child: "After some time, \[the violence\] became part of
me".\[113\]

S[everal papers describe unwanted teenage pregnancies, gynaecological
problems, and sexually transmitted illnesses among child
soldiers.]{.underline}\[99, 111, 112\] A case report on three former
child soldiers in the DRC describes a combined total of 403 medical
complaints and 275 physical findings in multiple organ systems.\[52\]
[[The sheer number]{.mark} and diversity [of complaints]{.mark} and
somatic findings in these three youth [provides insight into the
**extensive harm** wrought by association with armed
groups.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The witnessing, experience, and perpetration of sexual violence and
sexual exploitation are documented by numerous papers in this review,
nine of which dealt exclusively with these issues.\[56, 100, 104, 105,
115--119\] All included studies of children associated with armed groups
document sexual violence of and by these children. However, the studies
that focus exclusively on sexual violence and exploitation, suggest the
problem is far more widespread. These studies describe children being:
a) threatened with rape, b) raped, including gang rape, c) forced to
watch rapes, including rapes of family members, and d) forced to rape
others and engage in sexual slavery. They also document "survival-", or
transactional sex to obtain basic needs, and early marriage. Documented
physical findings include traumatic genital injuries, vesicovaginal
fistulae, and pregnancy. Two studies describe the experiences of
children conceived through sexual violence, including social isolation
and exposure to violence and threats from within their
communities.\[100, 118\] A survey of women raising children conceived
through conflict-associated rape reported that 66.1% often saw their
assailant and/or remembered the sexual assault when they looked at their
child.\[118\]

[More than one-third]{.underline} (n = 64) [of studies included
mortality as a main outcome]{.underline}. The heterogeneity of design
and lack of denominators in much of the reported data preclude the
pooling of data. However, numerous studies report significant increases
in infant and child mortality during periods of armed conflict, in
comparison to peacetime or when compared with peaceful parts of the same
country.\[21, 60, 82, 120--127\] Most of these studies report on under 5
years (U5) mortality.

#### Plan also solves by preventing the armed recruitment of children\-\-\-- many children join related to the safety or threat of armed violence

P.W. **Singer 05,** former director of the Center for 21st Century
Security and Intelligence and a senior fellow in Foreign Policy at
Brookings, 1/1/05, "The New Faces of War"
<https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/singer20051215.pdf>

Transforming a child into a fairly effective combatant is disturbingly
simple. It begins with recruitment, [either through abduction or
"voluntary" means]{.underline}. Recruitment is rapidly followed by cruel
but straightforward methods of training and conversion. Brutality and
abuses of the worst kind underscore each stage, but these lie in part
behind the overall program's usual effectiveness. The ultimate aim of
the process is to foster a child's dependency on an armed organization
and inhibit escape. Case studies indicate that in the majority of
conflicts, [[a widely used method of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[recruitment
of children is **some form of abduction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Typically, recruiting parties are given conscription targets that change
according to the group's needs and objectives. For example, the Union of
Congolese Patriots for Reconciliation and Peace (UPC/RP),
[a]{.underline} [militia led by Thomas Lubanga in eastern Congo, has a
policy that each family within its]{.underline} [area of control must
provide a cow, money, or child to the group.]{.underline}42 Often, the
groups are more efficient. For example, the LRA in Uganda sets numeric
goals for child recruits and sends raiding parties into villages to meet
them.43

The decision of where groups carry out their operations to find their
recruits is also based on planned efforts to maximize the efficiency of
their efforts. [The most frequent targets]{.underline} [are secondary
schools or orphanages, where children of suitable size are collected in
one]{.underline} [place, but out of contact with their parents, who
would try to spirit them away]{.underline}. Indeed, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) even took to setting up a unit formed
exclusively of orphans, the elite Sirasu Puli (Leopard Brigade).44 The
Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) and Rwandan Patriotic Army
(RPA) are two other groups that also target schools almost exclusively,
using kidnapping or coercion to pull in kids. [Another common target
area is the marketplace. For instance, during the Ethiopian]{.underline}
[fighting in the 1990s, [a common practice was]{.mark} **[that armed
militias would simply surround]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[the public
bazaar]{.mark}**. They would order every male to sit down [and then
force into a truck]{.mark}]{.underline} [[anyone deemed
"eligible."]{.mark} This often included minors.]{.underline}

Homeless or street children are at particular risk, as they are most
vulnerable to sweeps aimed at them, which prompt less public outcry. In
Sudan, for instance, the government set up camps for street children,
and then rounded up children to fill them in a purported attempt to
"clean up" Khartoum. These camps, however, served as reservoirs for army
conscription.45

Other groups that are in frequent danger are refugee and IDP (internally
displaced persons) populations. In many instances, families on the run
become disconnected. Armed groups then target unaccompanied, and thus
more vulnerable, minors.

[Not all children are forced into soldiering, though. Many may "choose"
to join an armed group]{.underline} and thus the groups that use them
often claim they broke no moral codes. The rough trend line seems to be
that nearly two out of every three child soldiers have some sort of
initiative in their own recruitment. For example, estimates are that 40
percent of the FARC's child soldiers are forced into service, and 60
percent joined of their own volition.46 Another survey in East Asia
found that 57 percent of the children had volunteered.47 Finally, a
survey of child soldiers in four African countries found that 64 percent
joined under no threat of violence.48

[To describe this choice as voluntary, however, is greatly
misleading]{.underline}.49 The most basic reason that children join
armed groups is that they are driven to do so by forces beyond their
control. [[A particularly strong factor is economic.]{.mark} Hunger and
poverty are endemic in conflict zones. [Children,]{.mark} particularly
those orphaned or [disconnected from civil society, may]{.mark}
volunteer to [join]{.mark} any group [if they believe that this is the
only way to guarantee regular meals, clothing, or medical
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one young boy in the DRC explained,
"I joined \[President Laurent\] Kabila's army when I was 13 because my
home had been looted and my parents were gone. As I was then on my own,
I decided to become a soldier."50 Indeed, surveys of demobilized child
soldiers in the DRC found that almost 60 percent originally joined armed
groups because of simple poverty.51 The same ratio was found in a
separate survey of child soldiers half the globe away in East Asia,
indicating a broader international trend.52

[[Children may also join]{.mark} armed organizations [for
protection.]{.mark} Surrounded by violence and chaos, [children may
decide they are safer]{.mark} in a conflict group[, **with guns in their
own hands, than going about by themselves
unarmed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, a good portion of girl
soldiers who join as "volunteers" cite domestic abuse or exploitation as
the underlying reason for joining.53

[Innocent children have been tricked into joining with extraordinary or
impossible promises to which only gullible children would give
credence]{.underline}. In Sierra Leone, for example, the RUF promised
poor rural children that fighting would help them escape the poverty and
misery many of them had known all their lives[. As one child fighter
describes, "They told us we'd all have our own vehicle. They told us
they'd build houses for us. They told us many things."54 In Liberia,
Charles Taylor promised that every child fighting for his group would
get a computer if he won the war]{.underline}.55

Many children may have personally experienced or been witness to the
furthest extremes of violence, including massacres, summary executions,
ethnic cleansing, death squad killings, bombings, torture, sexual abuse,
and destruction of home or property. Thus, vengeance can also be a
particularly powerful impetus to join the conflict.56

[Lastly, some groups may take deliberate advantage of the fact that
adolescents are at a stage in life where they are still defining their
identity]{.underline}. Conflict groups offer what are perceived as
glamorous or honorable roles (soldier, hero, leader, protector), as well
as membership and acceptance in a group. These messages are particularly
seductive in areas where children feel the most powerless or victimized.
[One survey of child soldiers in Africa found that [15 percent
volunteered because they were simply fascinated by]{.mark} the prestige
and thrill of serving in a unit and **[having a
gun]{.mark}.**]{.underline}57

### Genocide

#### South Sudan civil war escalates to genocide -- presidential denial of crisis, ethnic killings spreading, reporters beaten and killed -- US engagement has failed, arms embargo key

Nick **Turse 16**, award-winning journalist and historian, 12/21/16,
"America's Theater AN INTERVIEW WITH NICK TURSE,"
<https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/12/obama-foreign-policy-south-sudan-war-drones-trump>

EM: The [United Nations recently alleged that [ethnic cleansing]{.mark}
was [unfolding in South Sudan.]{.mark} The president, Salva
[Kiir]{.mark}, [denied]{.mark} these [allegations]{.mark}. Tens, maybe
hundreds of [thousands of people have died]{.mark} --- nobody knows the
exact number.]{.underline} Can you describe the country's history for
readers who know little about the conflict, and talk about the current
situation?

NT: South Sudan is the youngest nation on earth. Its independence day
was in July 2011. The [South Sudanese won their independence
through]{.underline} very [long, bloody struggles]{.underline} with the
north of the country, today Sudan, that went back into the 1950s. But
[the United States played a significant part.]{.underline} There was a
real [bipartisan push in Washington.]{.underline}

EM: We "midwifed" it.

NT: Yeah. "Midwife" is the word that John Kerry used when he was in the
Senate. Clinton used the term as well when she was secretary of state.
It's indelicate to some degree, but there's a lot of truth to it. The
[United States put a lot of time, effort, and money into creating South
Sudan.]{.underline} But by [December of [2013]{.mark}, it had slid into
a [civil war]{.mark}, an exceptionally brutal war.]{.underline}

I travelled there in 2014, just after the war began, in 2015 again, and
then earlier this year. [It's [gotten progressively worse.]{.mark} The
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations Special Envoy [mentioned the
possibility of **genocide, a Rwanda-type
situation.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is what people were telling me even in 2015, when I did the
reporting for my book. A lot of times people would whisper the word
"Rwanda" to me, saying that that was their great fear. Looking at it
from afar, this is what I really fear today. We're right at the
precipice now.

I spent several weeks earlier this year in [[a town called
Leer]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[could be a model for the bloodletting
to come.]{.mark} This was a wasteland. [The]{.mark} entire [town was
razed to the ground.]{.mark}]{.underline} I walked through [[a
field]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[was strewn with human remains, skulls,
rib cages, femurs, spinal columns.]{.mark} It was a horrorscape. People
there were too afraid to even bury their dead.]{.underline}

[**[This is starting to happen in other areas]{.mark} of the country as
well**; areas that for the last couple of years have been untouched by
war. But [it's spreading.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We're seeing [[ethnic killings, machete killings, village
burnings.]{.mark} It's looking exceedingly grim.]{.underline} I'm
actually right now looking for an outlet to send me back, because there
are stories that need to be told there.

And [it's exceedingly difficult for reporters]{.underline}. South
Sudanese reporters who do this type of work --- it's a very dangerous
environment for them. [[Reporters are threatened. They're kidnapped and
beaten. Some are killed. **No one has been held accountable** for these
beatings, abductions, killings.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's open season on
reporters there.

It's a sad situation, and it's been one. I have a tough time
understanding what the [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration's
modus operandi was with South Sudan. It [[resisted]{.mark}, for years,
[imposing an arms embargo on the country]{.mark} --- something that
seemed to be a no-brainer.]{.underline}

EM: And there is a child soldier piece as well, right?

NT: [[Under]{.mark} the [C]{.mark}hild [S]{.mark}oldier
[P]{.mark}rotection [A]{.mark}ct, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[isn't allowed to give aid to countries that have children under
arms.]{.mark} [But, year after year, we gave South Sudan a pass.]{.mark}
[This was]{.mark} all [done with]{.mark} the [thinking]{.mark} that
[somehow]{.mark} then [we'd have more leverage]{.mark} over them[. But
instead they kept their child soldiers, kept importing arms, and kept
killing their own people.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the last couple of weeks [the United States pushed for an actual arms
embargo, but no one in the international community wanted to sign on to
it. So it crashed and burned at the United Nations. When the threat of
an arms embargo disappeared, so did any kind of leverage. The Kiir
government now has a free hand.]{.underline}

EM: [Why]{.underline} has the [United States been so involved in South
Sudan?]{.underline} What does the Obama administration view as American
interests in South Sudan?

NT: I wish I had an answer for you. I tried asking State Department
representatives, went to the National Security Council at the White
House and tried asking these same questions, and it was [always an
incoherent answer.]{.underline} I could never quite make heads or tails
of it.

[They were always talking about leverage]{.underline}, that they didn't
want to foreclose the possibility. [[They thought engagement was better
than cutting South Sudan off.]{.mark} [But]{.mark} you have
[people]{.mark} that [are dying at the hands of a government.]{.mark}
The United States knew this full well.]{.underline}

[At some point you have to say]{.underline}, "This idea of [[leverage
hasn't worked.]{.mark} Maybe **[it's time to cut off the flow of
arms.]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [It seems like a no-brainer, but they were
playing some sort of long game that seems to have gotten away from
them.]{.underline}

### Sexual Violence

#### Sexual violence faced by girl soldiers [scars]{.underline}, exacerbates [gender inequality]{.underline}, and leads to a life of [social rejection]{.underline}

Solange **Mouthaan 14**, Associate Professor at the University of
Warwick, School of Law. 12/2/14, "Barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen:
Am I a child soldier too?" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2014.11.004

There is very little data available to accurately assess the historical
and current roles that girls fulfil in armed conflicts. Nevertheless,
[[girls]{.underline}]{.mark} are also recruited and used by commanders
of armed groups and [[account for 40% of]{.underline}]{.mark} child
[[recruits]{.underline}]{.mark} (Save the Children Report, 2005). The
lack of available data may be partly due to a gendered perception that
girls do not or cannot fight and thus girls\' participation in armed
conflict has not been monitored until recently. However, it is important
to understand the roles girls fulfil within armed groups in order to
provide girl child soldiers with appropriate legal responses. Indeed
many of the [[harms]{.mark} suffered by girl child soldiers]{.underline}
are [[include]{.underline}]{.mark}d in the ICC Statute, 2002. **[[Rape,
sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced
pregnancy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or any other forms of sexual violence
are separate war crimes (Articles 8(2)(b)(xxii) & 8(2)(e)(vi)) and
separate crimes against humanity (Article 7(1)(g)). However, this
category of gender-based crimes is still under-investigated and
under-prosecuted (Mouthaan, 2011). The ICC still lacks a consistent
approach towards the prosecution of gender-based crimes. For instance,
as will be examined, in the Lubanga trial, the prosecutor, in exercising
his prosecutorial discretion, decided not to include charges of crimes
of sexual violence. As a consequence, the harms suffered by girl child
soldiers, including sexual slavery, rape and other sexual crimes, were
overlooked.

An alternative approach is to understand sexual violence as part and
parcel of the child soldering experience to be addressed within the war
crime of recruitment and use of child soldiers, rather than be
prosecuted as a separate war crime of sexual slavery or other form of
sexual violence. As argued by Askin (2005, p. 143), Bus (2002, p. 6 )and
Oosterveld (2013, p. 70) more generally, the dual basis of targeting
within the crime needs to be recognised. [Girls are targets of the war
crime to recruit and use child soldiers.]{.underline} In addition [girls
are also targeted for sexual abuse on the basis of their
gender.]{.underline} The Prosecutor in the Lubanga case could have
resorted to a dual basis for the prosecution of the crime and the
underlying gendered nature of the crime. The Court would then have been
able to address whether there were different ways in which girls and
boys were used, thus addressing underlying gendered aspects of the
crime.

For, although there are similarities between the experiences of boy and
girl child soldiers, girl child soldiers also present distinctive
gendered characteristics. Similarly to the recruitment of boys, there
are a variety of reasons for girls to join, voluntarily or not, an armed
force or group. [Socio-economic circumstances, political ideology,
poverty or breakdown of family and community structures, social,
economic and political emancipation may encourage girls to join an armed
force or group in order to acquire protection, healthcare, food and
shelter.]{.underline} Child soldier recruitment of both boys and girls
also presents a set of gender-specific features. [Girls may join an
armed force or group to seek personal protection from domestic
mistreatment or sexual violence]{.underline} (Denov, 2007). [Girls
are]{.underline} also [more likely to be abducted for domestic and
sexual purposes.]{.underline}

More importantly, similarly to boy child soldiers, girls may perform a
variety of roles within armed groups. Girls may be used as active
combatants or for other military purposes (Thomas, 2008). Boys and girls
alike may be used indirectly in support roles as human shields,
messengers, spies, cooks, porters and mine clearers. In addition,
[pre-existing **[gender inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline} may be
replicated, even [**[exacerbated]{.mark}**, [within]{.mark} the
organisation of [the armed group with girls]{.mark} being [used to
perform socially constructed gendered roles such as]{.mark} carrying out
[domestic tasks]{.mark}]{.underline}, including cooking and washing
clothes, providing medical care and run camps. In addition, the [[older
girls]{.mark} are [more vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline} than the boys
[[to]{.mark}]{.underline} grave violations of their human rights through
[[sexual violence]{.mark}, sexual [exploitation, forced marriage,
and]{.mark} increased exposure to [sexually transmitted diseases]{.mark}
such as HIV/AIDS]{.underline} (Human Rights Watch Report, 2003). As
Coomaraswamy stated, for girls, recruitment is a "particularly
horrendous experience" (ICC, Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo,
ICC-01/04--01/06--2842T-223-ENG, judgement pursuant to Article 74 of the
Statute, & 14 March, 2012, pp. 30--31). Girl child soldiers are much
more likely than boys to experience sexual abuse (Sivakumaran, 2013, p.
19). [In Sierra Leone, recruited]{.underline} young [girls]{.underline}
were [used to fulfil the role of "wife" to rebel commanders;
and]{.underline} as a consequence of related sexual activity [many
became pregnant and faced higher risks of exposure to sexually
transmitted diseases]{.underline} (Denov, 2007, p. 20). Moreover, the
[[boys\']{.mark} experiences]{.underline} of recruitment and use also
[contain gendered aspects. They]{.underline} may suffer sexual violence
or may [[learn to be sexually violent]{.mark} towards civilians or
colleagues.]{.underline}

The [[aftermath]{.underline}]{.mark} of participation in armed conflict
is also not [with]{.underline}out [its own specific challenging gendered
issues. In Sierra Leone, girls were expected to re-adhere to traditional
gender-specific roles]{.underline} (Denov, 2007, p. 21). Many girl child
[[soldiers]{.mark},]{.underline} often [[with]{.mark} their own
[children, faced rejection and social stigma due to]{.mark} cultural
practices and [beliefs for the **roles they**]{.mark} were expected to
**[perform as child soldiers]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Denov, 2007, p.
163).

#### Child soldiering starts an unending cycle of sexual violence -- ingrains a culture of violence and lawlessness in society, allowing armies to keep recruiting young girls

Waltraud Queiser **Morales 11**, Professor of Political Science at
University of Central Florida, Spring 2011, "Girl soldiers: the other
face of sexual exploitation and gender violence," PDF

Conditions of civil war and armed conflict undermine the ability of
families and communities to protect young members of both sexes\--but
especially very young girls, who are socially, culturally, and often
religiously restricted, even in peacetime. Moreover, a large number of
these female victims of social chaos and violence become orphans and
refugees, desperately struggling to survive the hunger, pain, and
disease that terrorism, revolution, and war bring. These girls are easy
prey in a cycle of abuse. Global conflicts rob them of their childhood,
humanity, and very lives. Sources estimate that over 300,000 children
younger than 18 have been caught up in over 30 global conflicts. (5) Of
these, some 40 percent or 120,000 child soldiers are girls, whose plight
is often unrecognized since international attention has largely focused
on boy soldiers. (6) Generally, when people speak of child soldiers, the
popular image is that of boys rather than the thousands of girls who
comprise the less visible \"shadow armies\" in conflicts around the
world. [Girls]{.underline} not only [serve as active
fighters]{.underline} but also [perform other military functions, from
intelligence and medical support to cleaning and cooking.]{.underline}
Worse, [a number of [young]{.mark}\--even prepubescent\--[girls become
sex slaves]{.mark} to service the forces [and]{.mark}/or [are coerced
into pseudomarriages]{.mark} with commanders of armed
groups.]{.underline} (7)

According to the United Nations and Save the Children, key conflict
areas where the tragic problem of boy and girl soldiers has been and
remains acute include Colombia, East Timor, Pakistan, Uganda, the
Philippines, Sri Lanka, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
western and northern Africa. (8) However, conflict-induced atrocities
against boys and girls are not entirely new. In wars historically and in
modern conflicts such those in as Afghanistan, Chechnya, the former
Yugoslavia, Haiti, Liberia, Peru, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone, recruitment
and abuse of child soldiers have occurred. [Like]{.underline} the
[boys,]{.underline} [typically the **[majority of girl soldiers are
abducted]{.mark}** or forcibly recruited into regular and irregular
armed groups]{.underline}, ranging from government-backed
paramilitaries, militias, and self-defense forces to antigovernment
opposition and factional groups often based on ideological, partisan,
and ethnic or religious affinity. [A minority of girls, especially, may
seem to join irregular armies \"voluntarily,\" but most have no choice
and are desperate to escape the violence and abuse around them,
enlisting simply to survive.]{.underline}

Once militarized and hardened by brutality, young children of both sexes
are often compelled to carry guns and kill\--sometimes other children
and even family members and relatives. In horrifying interviews, former
child soldiers have revealed that they had no choice other than kill or
be killed. Often [commanders]{.underline} of armed groups
[prefer]{.underline} child soldiers because young children, especially
[[girls, are more obedient]{.mark}, [vulnerable, and]{.mark} malleable,
and their moral codes are unformed and [readily manipulated.]{.mark}
Children can be indoctrinated early to become the next generation of
terrorists and rebels as well as a sympathetic support base in civil
society. And [because]{.mark} most [child soldiers are unpaid and
require less food, they provide quick, cheap fighter power on
demand.]{.mark}]{.underline} With the proliferation of light but deadly
arms, even very young girls can serve as combat soldiers. In one report,
a humanitarian worker in Liberia in 2003, near the end of the 10-year
civil war, reported seeing a \"child soldier so small that the barrel of
her gun was dragging on the ground.\" (9) Both very young girls and boys
can perform essential support functions and free up more seasoned, adult
male warriors. Consequently, [[girl soldiers]{.mark}, no less than boy
soldiers, [have become disposable cannon fodder in the front
lines]{.mark} of third world armies, terrorist groups, and guerrilla
insurgencies.]{.underline}

Conditions of political and social instability and violence are often
caused by or accompanied by overpopulation, scarcity, and environmental
devastation such as drought, flood, famine, and other natural and
manmade disasters. (10) Some of the worst ecological devastation and
human-rights abuses have occurred in the \"failed states\" of Africa;
however, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin
America have had their share of intrastate violence. Hans Magnus
[Enzensberger coined the term molecular [civil war]{.mark}s to describe
the breakdown of the state and the out-of-control civil wars wherein
young and desperate children prey on the helpless and each
other.]{.underline} (11) In his view, these irregular wars not only are
rife in the economically disadvantaged developing world but also are
expressed in the brutal gang violence and urban warfare that beset major
industrialized and postmodern societies around the globe. Experts also
have noted that these \"low-intensity armed conflicts shade directly
into terrorism and the illegal traffic in weapons and drugs,\" blood
diamonds, rich minerals, and human and sexual slavery. (12) [These
[conditions victimize the young and foster a culture of violence and
lawlessness]{.mark} that may become an attractive\--as well as the only
viable\--alternative for young boys and girls, who will become
traumatized and more readily \"socialized\" into the next generation of
insurgents, support forces, and warriors. Globally, [**entire
generations of children** have already been **decimated** by this
crisis, especially young girls]{.mark}\-- once the [future mothers,
caregivers, and familial anchors within these
societies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Gender-based violence against child soldiers spills over to the public -- spreading of HIV pandemic, high birth mortality, child abandonment

Waltraud Queiser **Morales 11**, Professor of Political Science at
University of Central Florida, Spring 2011, "Girl soldiers: the other
face of sexual exploitation and gender violence," PDF

These cases demonstrate that [during]{.underline} both internal and
external [warfare,]{.underline} irregular (and even regular)
[[armies]{.mark} systematically and intentionally [employ gender-based
violence]{.mark}\--]{.underline}or violence that targets women and
female children disproportionately\--[[as an]{.mark} effective
[instrument of terror, psychological warfare]{.mark} against
communities, [and]{.mark} outright **[ethnic
cleansing.]{.mark}**]{.underline} (37) Gender-based [violence can be
directed against]{.underline} young girls and [females from all cultures
and socioeconomic classes]{.underline} although the poor and
dispossessed are more readily targeted. [Armies target women and young
female children because they are the most vulnerable and
powerless]{.underline} generally\--especially [in underdeveloped and
conflict-ridden third world countries.]{.underline} Particularly in
Africa, for example, human-rights workers have witnessed systematic and
unspeakable violence against women and very small children; moreover,
they have encountered rape victims as young as 14 months. [In desperate
situations of survival, girl soldiers may be forced to
barter]{.underline} their [sexual services to avoid greater abuse and
mutilation or simply to remain alive for another day or
week.]{.underline} Indeed the International Rescue Committee and
[U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations human-rights organizations
[report the use of rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and
\"marriage,\"]{.underline} and general violence and mutilation [as
typical weapons employed against girl soldiers]{.underline} worldwide.
Clearly [[these tactics rise to major human-rights abuses]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} war crimes]{.underline} in some situations, [but they also
[threaten the public health and safety]{.mark} of the populations where
they occur.]{.underline} (38) In Africa, as elsewhere, [the
**[HIV]{.mark}/AIDS [pandemic]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well as other
sexually transmitted illnesses has been [[**fueled** by]{.mark}
indiscriminate, [gender-based violence. Other]{.mark}]{.underline}
negative [[consequences include **high maternal and infant
mortality**]{.mark} rates]{.underline} (as well as subsequent
**[[suicides by mothers]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[and the **abandonment
of unwanted children.**]{.underline}]{.mark} (39)

### Post-Conflict Impacts

#### Recurrence of conflicts are more likely due to child soldiering -- [economic instabilities]{.underline} make recruitment easier, [PTSD]{.underline} and [aggression]{.underline} increase post-conflict instability

Roos **Haer 15**, assistant professor of International Relations at
Leiden university, et al. 5/11/15, "Child soldiers as time bombs?
Adolescents' participation in rebel groups and the recurrence of armed
conflict," https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066115581910

First, compared to children who have not been recruited by rebel groups,
[former [child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} are more likely to
[[experience economic disadvantages due to]{.mark} a [lack of
education]{.mark} after a conflict has ceased.]{.underline} The
[[resulting]{.mark} economic [weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} in
post-conflict states [[may then motivate the recurrence of
fighting.]{.underline}]{.mark} This argument belongs to the willingness
cluster of the theoretical framework on conflict recurrence, but also
includes elements of opportunity as former child soldiers already have
the skills for and are 'acquainted with' violent conflict. Brett and
McCallin (1998: 134), for instance, suggest that [former child
soldiers]{.underline} often [find themselves alienated from the
traditional means of livelihood as they never had the opportunity to
obtain the skills that underpin the economic bases of their communities
once they lay down weapons.]{.underline} Consequently, economic issues
due to a lack of education weigh especially heavily on former child
soldiers (Wessells, 2006: 202).3 Similarly, Blattman and Annan (2010)
show that rebels' [child soldier recruitment in Uganda had a negative
impact on former child soldiers]{.underline}' (post-conflict) education
and earnings [due to the lack of civilian schooling.]{.underline}4
According to these scholars, this education deficit impedes
labour-market success: while former child soldiers are just as likely to
be employed, they are half as likely to be engaged in skilled work, and
they earn wages that are lower by a third. The fact that former child
soldiers in particular suffer economically is also confirmed by research
on the challenges that former child soldiers faced in Mozambique and El
Salvador (e.g. Boothby et al., 2006; Santacruz and Arana, 2002).

In other words, [[former child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[have
no skills]{.mark} other than killing and being able to fieldstrip
weapons]{.underline} (Singer, 2006: 111), [and future life prospects are
dimmed for them in the wider region.]{.underline}
[[This]{.mark}]{.underline} may significantly [[raise the
willingness]{.mark} of former child soldiers [to start fighting again
since]{.mark} recruitment costs are reduced]{.underline} (from the
perspective of the rebel group) [and [rejoining]{.mark}]{.underline} a
rebel group might [[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} at least [[access to
basic necessities and supplies]{.mark},]{.underline} such as food,
shelter and so on, [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps even [a higher
[income]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Barnitz, 1997; Honwana, 2006;
Wessells, 2010). A Liberian child soldier, for example, told Human
Rights Watch (2004, quoted in Wessells, 2006: 168):

\[f\]or a while, I did some small jobs around Monrovia, but there was
not much to do and I could not afford to go back to school. So two years
ago, I decided to join the Liberians United for Reconciliation and
Democracy (LURD). I figured I was better to fight and try to get
something, than hang around town doing nothing.

As such, rejoining rebel groups might be the only viable outside option
that former child soldiers have in post-conflict societies.

Second, and reinforced, in fact, by the preceding argumentation on
economic and educational disadvantages, [child]{.underline} soldiering
might cause [psychological harm]{.underline} in a way that [can have
severely negative consequences for post-conflict stability]{.underline}
(Freud and Burlingham, 1943; Masten and Nyaran, 2012). Typically, former
[child combatants have undergone and]{.underline}/or [carried out
shocking and disturbing violent actions]{.underline} (Barnitz, 1997;
Machel, 1996). Due to the fact that they are young, [the
effect]{.underline} of these events [on children's psyches is magnified
as they occur]{.underline} during a period [when personalities are being
formed and]{.underline} in which [the brain and its functions are still
in development. Traumatic experiences in these]{.underline} sensitive
[periods]{.underline} might [have an especially negative impact on
development]{.underline}, either [because the child is particularly
responsive at that time]{.underline} or because the brain is becoming
'programmed', that is, it adapts to the new information and will
subsequently filter all new information on the basis of these changes
(Masten and Narayan, 2012; Perry, 1997). Perry et al. (1995: 290)
formulate it even more strongly: 'experiences can change the nature of
the brain, but experiences during critical periods of early childhood
organize brain systems'.

[[Due to]{.underline}]{.mark} children's
[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or lack of coping mechanisms,
these [[traumatic events]{.mark}]{.underline} might
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[in]{.mark} affective
blindness or]{.underline} in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
([[PTSD]{.underline}]{.mark}) (Perry, 1997).5 PTSD is a psychiatric
disorder that was first associated with battle fatigue among soldiers
during the First and Second World Wars. [It may lead to both
[physical]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. severe headaches, stomach pain,
sleep disorders) [[and mental symptoms]{.underline}]{.mark} (depression,
anxiety, high levels of aggression, extreme pessimism or a limited
capacity to accept frustration), [[which]{.mark}]{.underline}
particularly [[impair]{.mark} former child soldiers' [ability to
function]{.mark}]{.underline} in [day-to-day]{.underline} living, as
compared with adults and children who have not been recruited by armed
groups (see also Singer, 2006: 194).6 In other words, traumatic
experiences during childhood increase the risk of developing a variety
of neuropsychiatric symptoms in adolescence and adulthood (see Perry et
al., 1995). Perry (1997) and Masten and Narayan (2012) provide good
overviews of how traumatic events influence neurological development and
how these experiences influence the subsequent emotional, behavioural,
cognitive and social functioning of children.

[One]{.underline} of the most worrying [symptom]{.underline}s [connected
to [children's war participation]{.mark} is]{.underline} a supposed
[[increase]{.mark} in]{.underline} their level of
[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, as compared with adults and children
who have not fought for an armed group, once a conflict has ceased (see
Cohn and Goodwin-Gill, 1994). Within armed groups, [[child
soldiers]{.mark} are especially susceptible to [learn]{.mark}ing
[aggressive behaviour by observing and imitating
others]{.mark}]{.underline} (Berkowitz, 1993; Schauer and Elbert, 2010;
Singer, 2006: 193f). As Dickson-Gómez (2002: 350) states: '[these
children are constantly surrounded by extreme levels of violence, that
violence therefore becomes normalized']{.underline}. As a result of this
normalization of violence, [former [child soldiers often resolve
conflicts violently in a post-conflict environment]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Schauer and Elbert, 2010: 335). Magambo and Lett (2004), for instance,
report that [former child soldiers in Northern Uganda applied physical
violence to resolve conflicts and that they were not able to think of
any non-violent alternatives, reflecting an absence of adequate social
skills.]{.underline} These necessary skills are also not always acquired
after a conflict ends since these children often encounter broken family
networks that could have provided a better regulation of the use of
violence and would have helped them to settle in a more peaceful,
institutionalized civil life (Steenkamp, 2005).

### Gender Violence 

#### Girl child soldiers experience unique harm in fighting forces -- require new paradigm of analysis to fully understand -- International community has a duty to help and prevent girl child soldiers

public health: towards an intersectional human rights framework for
considering the prevention and treatment of harms to girl child
soldiers" https://doi.org/10.1080/1323238X.2008.11910835

[[Armed forces]{.underline}]{.mark}, both regular and irregular[, are
[known to recruit or abduct forcibly girls]{.mark} and female youth [as
soldiers, domestics and sex slaves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A variety of
serious [public health consequences arise from]{.mark} the targeted
[violence, particularly sexual]{.mark}, [that occur]{.mark}s
[through]{.mark} the [captivity,]{.mark} enslavement and forced
\'marriage\' of girls [in fighting forces]{.mark}.]{.underline} Sierra
Leone is a dramatic example of this abuse and exploitation, wherein
civil war led to the creation of an estimated 12,000 of these girl child
soldiers.l [To realise the human rights of these girls, it is necessary
to consider the public health implications of their harms holistically,
because effective prevention of violence and treatment of its effects
must address the underlying structural determinants of health implicated
in multiple violations of the different intersecting rights of girls and
female youth.]{.underline}

As a grave public health concern, [[girl children and female youth in
internal armed conflict are most vulnerable]{.mark} as women and as
children, yet [they experience a unique **complex** of **overlapping**
**gender**]{.mark}- [and **age**-**related** **harms** **unaccounted**
**for** by independent women\'s or children\'s human rights
**frameworks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addressing the synoptic public
health harms arising from abduction, sexual slavery and forced labour,
this human rights analysis of public health research data reveals that
[[girl child soldiers experience a cumulative vulnerability]{.mark} that
is more than the sum of its parts and [therefore requires a new rights
paradigm that acknowledges this complex reality]{.mark}:]{.underline}
namely, [[a paradigm wherein multiple axes of **discrimination**,
**oppression**, **exploitation** and **violence** are seen as
interacting, reinforcing and mutually constitutive]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This article seeks to develop a \'vector of rights\' framework
commensurate to addressing the overlapping rights violations suffered by
girl child soldiers. In making this argument for intersectional
obligations under a vector of rights approach, the authors describe the
abduction, forced domestic labour, sexual slavery and captive marriage
of girl child soldiers in internal armed conflict, looking specifically
to Sierra Leone\'s civil war as a case study. The authors then outline
[the myriad individual human rights norms violated by the lived
experiences of girl child soldiers, illustrating how human rights
treaties for children and for women have been brought to bear
individually for the protection and treatment of separate gender- and
age-specific harms to girls in fighting forces]{.underline}. Through
this outline, the authors highlight insufficiencies of an atomised
rights framework for female children/youth in armed conflict, arguing
that a new, [[comprehensive framework is necessary]{.mark}. This new
framework, a \'vector\' approach to human rights[,]{.mark}]{.underline}
is then justified by the authors as part of [[an intersectional approach
to the complex public health harms to girl child
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Amplified by state abuse against girl
children and female youth, girl soldiers experience profound health
consequences when internal conflict often causes a state\'s governance,
infrastructure and enforcement mechanisms to collapse to such a point
that there is arguably no state to bear its international obligations.
Acknowledging Sierra Leone\'s perpetration of such harms, this analysis
concludes that [legally proscribed duties inhere in [the international
community as a whole]{.mark}, [creat]{.mark}ing [a heightened duty of
international cooperation]{.mark} on all states as well as on
international nongovernmental organisations (NGOs[) to both prohibit and
remedy the gender- and age-specific harms to girls and female youth in
fighting forces pursuant to their \'vector\' of
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, in examining the collective legal
obligations of the international community in realising the proposed
vector of rights, the authors offer a number of institutional remedies
that could provide some of the necessary special attention to the
specific health needs and vulnerabilities of girls and female youth
forced to be soldiers, domestics and sex slaves.

#### Female Youth child soldiers suffer a disproportionate amount 

Annalijn **Conklin et al 17**, CIHR postdoctoral fellow at UCLA\'s world
Policy Analysis Center, 10/30/17 "A 'vector of rights' approach for
public health: towards an intersectional human rights framework for
considering the prevention and treatment of harms to girl child

[Despite the increasing numbers of girls and female youth in fighting
forces]{.underline}, growing evidence documents how, unlike boys,
[f[emale child and youth soldiers **remain** **virtually** **invisible**
as a **highly** **marginalised** **group**]{.mark}, receiving little
attention at community, national and international levels either during
or after conflict]{.underline} (McKay and Mazurana 2004; McKay 2005;
Denov and Maclure 2004; 1999; Verhey 2004; Stark 2006; Burman and McKay
2007; Stavrou 2005). Indeed, formerly abducted girls and female youth
face huge reintegration challenges regarding limited availability of
work, marriage opportunities and access to or control over resources
(Burman and McKay 2007; Stavrou 2005). The continuing absence of direct
attention to their plight - in international law, among international
development agencies, in conflict research and in youth intervention
programming (Leibig 2005; Stavrou 2005; Sommers 2006)- undermines any
adequate attempt to prevent and treat their gender- and age-specific
harms pursuant to current human rights frameworks. [[Violations of the
rights of girls and female youth, through multiple]{.mark} and
interacting [forms of harm]{.mark}, including [physical and sexual
violence]{.mark}, [reveal **underlying** **structural** **determinants**
of harm]{.mark}]{.underline} (WHO 2002) [and constitute structural
violence to female youth in fighting forces]{.underline} (Farmer 2003).
The [punishing prejudice of neglect for their complex suffering and
vulnerabilities has profound implications for public health, with
corresponding implications on wider social determinants of health,
including poverty, child development, housing and education]{.underline}
(Marmot and Wilkinson 2005; Link and Phelan 2005; Lynch et a! 2000).

Examining these health harms, [[girls]{.mark} are physiologically
different from boys and developmentally distinct from women]{.underline}
(Stavrou 2005; Verhey 2004; Kostelny 2004[), [experienc]{.mark}ing both
[age-based harms with a gender dimension and gender-based harms with an
age dimension.]{.mark}]{.underline}

First, girl ex-soldiers have age-based physical and psychosocial health
needs (Stavrou 2005; Annan et a! 2006) related to their unique
vulnerabilities at neurobiological (UNICEF 2002) and developmental
levels (Wessells 2006; Boothby 1992). The dominance of adults in
peace-building and reconstruction activities and processes, with limited
child-sensitive interventions, means that girls are vulnerable as
children to psychosocial distress and to abysmal economic options
post-conflict (Sommers 2002; Annan et a! 2006). Evidence shows that
former girl soldiers experience chronic and severe mental health traumas
(Machel 2005), including posttraumatic stress from witnessing or
committing acts of violence and other psychosocial harms from prolonged
shame, confusion and guilt (Denov and Maclure 2004; Troyer 2005). But
such age-based vulnerabilities impact girls differently, as girls run a
higher risk than boys of being excluded from formal disarmament,
demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) processes, and yet may also have
greater difficulty or willingness to resume what are considered to be
normal, ageappropriate gender roles (Stark et a! 2007).

Second, [[girls experience]{.mark} several [gender-based harms]{.mark}
that are, in fact, [categorically different from what occurs with
men/boys in armed conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}- [women and [girls are
**more** **likely** to experience violations of both **civil** and
**political** rights and **economic** and **social** rights]{.mark}-
[experiencing suffering **more** **indirectly** **from** **internal**
**violence** and **oppression**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Phelps 2007). Like
most women\'s general experiences of conflict, the plight of girl
soldiers captures the \'myriad of vulnerabilities created by repressive
and conflicted societies for women\' (Ni Aolain and Turner 2007). [As
female combatants, girl and [female]{.mark} [youth soldiers
**disproportionately** **suffer**]{.mark} a range [of abuses]{.mark}
from [violent acts of commission]{.mark} as well as acts of [omission or
neglect]{.mark}, including family separation, displacement, abductions,
forced recruitment, sexualised torture, forced labour, rape, forced
prostitution, **forced** termination of pregnancy and
mutilation]{.underline} (UNICEF 1997; Happold 2005). Although boys and
young men in fighting forces suffer the harms of sexual violence
(Betancourt et a! 2005), rape of females in captivity has consequences
that cannot befall men/boys - women/ girls can have miscarriages, they
can become incapable of having children, they are physically more
vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STis) and they can be
forced to bear children conceived in rape (Phelps 2007[). Outside of
these **debilitating** **physical** and **psychological** **sequelae**
of sexual violence, formerly abducted [girl soldiers confront additional
gender-based harms from social isolation and condemnation as
\'spiritually contaminated]{.mark}\']{.underline} (Stark 2006; Kostelny
2004). Unlike that of boys, sexual [abuse of girl soldiers [specifically
forces girls]{.mark} and female youth [to more fully transgress gender
norms,]{.mark} resulting in community rejection, physical and verbal
abuse, extreme stigmatisation, inability to marry and abandonment to
poverty]{.underline} (Amnesty International1997; McKay 2005; Kostleny
2004; Stark 2006).4

### Impact

#### Child soldiers are forced to commit violent crimes and face psychological damage 

Carrie E. **Kimmel and** Jini L. **Roby 7-** Professors at School of
Social Work, Brigham Young University, 11/01/2007 **"**Institutionalized
child abuse: The use of child soldiers" International Social Work, vol.

Under the UN CRC, the most widely accepted child rights instrument in
history (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, n.d.),
children, by definition, belong to a class of individuals who need
special care and assistance (UN General Assembly, 1990). [Under the CRC,
children have the right to be protected from abuse]{.underline} (UN
General Assembly, 1990, Art. 19). Specifically, they have the right not
to be recruited into armed forces until age 15 and not to be used in
direct combat under the age of 15 (UN General Assembly, 1990, Art. 38).
Under the Optional Protocol, children are not to be compulsorily
recruited until age 18 and voluntary recruitment is to be at age 15 or
older (Art. 3). [[Despite]{.mark} these [stated]{.mark}
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, many [[children have been]{.mark}
[involved in direct combat]{.mark} and in other tasks related to
fighting, such as porting supplies and weapons; serving as spies,
messengers, sentries, servants, and -- in the case of girls -- as
'wives']{.underline}. Children are also used to lay and clear landmines
or do other highly hazardous tasks (Wessells, 2000). **[[They are
often]{.mark} [deprived of]{.mark} the most [basic needs]{.mark},
[including food and rest]{.mark}. [Children are beaten for making
mistakes, creating trouble, or trying to run
away]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Often]{.mark} the [children are forced to
kill or rape]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} are [exposed to drugs, violence and
sexual offences]{.mark}]{.underline} (Whitman and Fleishman, 1994).

Another basic right of children under the CRC, [[education, is]{.mark}
also]{.underline} severely [[compromised]{.mark} while the children are
off to war]{.underline}[. [After prolonged absence]{.underline}]{.mark}
[from school, [it is difficult for]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[former
child soldiers to attend school]{.mark} because [they are more familiar
with violence than]{.mark} with [academic study]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Dukuly, 2004). Soldier 'Roland B.' from Monserrado County in Liberia
explained, 'Most of our brothers . . . have been fighting . . . so all
they think about is war. But if you are educated, you can think of other
things' (Human Rights Watch, 2004: 4). In addition, the schools in
conflict zones face many obstacles including poor funding, few teachers
and lack of textbooks and pupils (Dukuly, 2004).

[In addition to having their human rights violated, [children also
suffer psychological and social damage]{.mark}]{.underline} from a
developmental perspective (Jareg, 2005), as has been well documented
(Barenbaum et al., 2004; Machel, 1996; MacMullin and Loughry, 2004).
[[When]{.mark} children are [separated from]{.mark} their [families,
**they are denied**]{.mark} **the [appropriate cultural norms, social
structures and support to develop]{.mark} strong
[values]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Faulkner, 2001). [They are deprived
of]{.underline} the [opportunity to experience childhood]{.underline}
and adolescence in the context of their own families and communities.
[**[Sustained exposure to]{.mark} the [armed group's values]{.mark} can
[confuse children about what is right and wrong]{.mark}** regarding
violence, human life and conflict resolution]{.underline} (Peam, 2003;
World Bank, 2002). When separation trauma is combined with experiences
in combat, [[child soldiers]{.mark} [become]{.mark} very [susceptible
to]{.mark}]{.underline} post-traumatic stress disorder
([[PTSD]{.mark})]{.underline} (Berman, 2001), with symptoms that include
recurring nightmares, illusions, flashbacks, panic attacks and a sense
of numbing detachment (Comer, 2004). They [[frequently resort to alcohol
and drugs, and struggle with identity crises]{.mark} compounded by their
disillusioning experiences]{.underline} (Utas, 2003). [These problems
can have a lasting effect,]{.underline} including interactions with
current and future families, if not corrected with therapeutic
intervention (Comer, 2004).

### AT: Colonialism Turn

#### Personal narratives show vulnerability of child soldiers and hold western readers accountable

Georgetown university, 2013 "Troubling Humanitarian Consumption:
Reframing Relationality in African Child Soldier Narratives." Research

Amid the generalized anxiety surrounding [the [predicament of youth in
the twenty-first century]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} [[deemed to
be in \"trouble\"]{.underline}]{.mark} in one sense or another all
[[across the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[one would be hard-pressed to
find a figure **more troubling** than that of the **child
soldier**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Understanding the idea of troubled youth
in Judith Butler\'s sense, as troubling figures that spark a productive
unsettlement of dominant narratives, in this paper I [argue for **[the
importance of paying attention to]{.mark}** the unsettling work that is
being performed in **[stories]{.mark}** that are [**told**
**by**]{.mark} and about African [**child**
**soldiers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although child soldiering is not a
new phenomenon, [the proliferation of representations of them in
contemporary socio-political, legal, and cultural discourse suggests
that the child soldier has, to a certain extent, become a twenty-first
century \"American pop icon]{.underline},\" according to Chris Blattman
(qtd. in Ochieng). In this paper, I look at a selection of
autobiographical and fictional child soldier narratives to explore how
this figure is being mobilized and challenged and what imaginative
cultural and political work is being performed in such narratives. In
particular, I consider how the relational strategies in these texts
trouble the already troubled relationship between the spaces where child
soldiers are being used and those where narratives about them are being
consumed.

How do we hear [[the voice of the child soldier]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
[[a quintessential figure of the **voiceless**]{.underline}]{.mark},
when it asserts itself within an imagined community of writers and
readers of literature? Especially considering the global politics of
publishing and marketing texts such as these, what is the nature of the
relationality between producers and consumers of these narratives? The
selection of stories that I look at here raises important questions
about \"Africa\" and \"Africanness\" as constructs that are produced and
consumed in the non-African
world.[1](https://muse-jhu-edu.turing.library.northwestern.edu/article/524805#f1) These
narratives respond to---as well as perpetuate---the contemporary demand
for stories of violence, displacement, and lost childhood. In the
context of what Schaffer and Smith characterize with due circumspection
as the \"decade of life narratives\" (1), it is important to recognize
the way that this demand is both ethically and market-based. The mass
consumption of such texts plays into and perpetuates global inequities
and dangerous stereotypes, whereas Barnard suggests nations \"come to
signify in a new way, as mediascapes, occasions for certain kinds of
stories\" (\"Oprah\'s Paton\" 15). If, as McClennen suggests, \"endless
difference negates the possibility of politically ethical comparison\"
(10), is it even possible to summon an ethical relationality in readerly
engagements with these tragic coming-of-age narratives, when the reality
of the African children depicted is always already so exotic, so
radically unlike (or so we imagine) the situation of \"our\" own
children?

I suggest that, even as they inevitably participate in what Illouz has
called \"therapeutic biography\" mode (qtd. in Barnard, \"Oprah\'s
Paton\" 9), these stories about child soldiers side-step generic
expectations by employing relational and indirect narrative strategies
that register a highly critical sensibility, thus potentially
challenging complacent readings. They point toward the need to move
beyond \"universalizing modes of sympathetic identification\" in order
to \"create instead an urgent sense for differently located viewers \[or
readers\] of their own ethical economic and political implication\"
(Brophy 44). My analysis here suggests that [[these narratives make
**ethical** **demands** **on** **Western** **readers**]{.mark} in order
[to try to complicate their easy or uncritical consumption]{.mark}. The
narratives [summon]{.mark} readers [as potential witnesses, holding them
accountable]{.mark}]{.underline} (however imperfectly) for their own
responses. While there are no guarantees, these indirect yet
insistent \[End Page 100\] narrative strategies succeed---at least
potentially---in coaxing the reader into recognizing vast webs of power
and complicity of which we all form a part. More than recuperative
rehabilitation narratives that end with the child subject being neatly
incorporated into the social realm, in these stories the unresolved
destruction of the protagonists\' families and communities and the
transnational displacements they are forced to undergo have the
potential to lead the reader to ponder larger questions about planetary
relations.

Relational Implications in Autobiographical Child Soldier Narratives

The following life narratives were written and published in contexts of
global displacement: Ishmael Beah wrote A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a
Boy
Soldier ([2007](https://muse-jhu-edu.turing.library.northwestern.edu/article/524805#b4))
after settling in New York, Senait Mehari wrote Heart of Fire: One
Girl\'s Extraordinary Journey from Child Soldier to Soul
Singer ([2006](https://muse-jhu-edu.turing.library.northwestern.edu/article/524805#b29))
from her new home in Germany, and Emmanuel Jal cowrote his memoir (with
Megan Lloyd Davies) Warchild: A Boy Soldier\'s
Story ([2009](https://muse-jhu-edu.turing.library.northwestern.edu/article/524805#b22))
after having immigrated to England. Beah recounts his experiences as a
child soldier in the government army in Sierra Leone, Jal gives an
account of his life in the Sudan People\'s Liberation Army (SPLA), and
Mehari tells us about her experiences at an Eritrean Liberation Front
(ELF) training camp. [In [each]{.mark} case, the narrator\'s personal
[storie]{.mark}s [of suffering]{.mark} [are called on to do specific
political work within human rights networks]{.mark}, which include UN
aid agencies, refugee camps, and rehabilitation centers]{.underline}.
However, the complexities of self-representation do not always line up
easily with the cultural work that these narratives are expected to do
in terms of human rights discourse. [While [this kind of storytelling is
**linked to human rights claims**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it is also
important to consider the consequences and complexities of this pressure
to \"represent oneself\" (Gilmore 19) on the world stage within contexts
of extreme duress and unequal power relationships]{.underline}. There
are specific generic expectations when it comes to memoir, or \"life
writing,\" which Gilmore argues \"has become the genre in the skittish
period around the turn of the millennium\" (1). Judith Butler\'s
observation that it is important to remain attentive to \"who is able to
tell the truth, about what, with what consequences, and with what
relation to power\" (131) is especially pertinent when [examining life
narratives written by former [child soldiers, who are]{.mark} among [the
world\'s **most vulnerable** populations]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Participating in what Spivak defines as the \"culture of testimony . . .
the genre of the subaltern giving witness to oppression, to a less
oppressed other\" (qtd. in Gilmore 2), these texts beg questions about
the politics of humanitarian consumption. Again, there are no guarantees
about how these narratives will be circulated and received by readers
who are \"interested in particular kinds of suffering\" (Schaffer and
Smith 23). Chosen as a selection for the Starbucks book club program,
Beah\'s memoir sold 62,000 copies in its first three weeks, testifying
to the need to think about how stories of vulnerability, pain, and \[End
Page 101\] dispossession are continually at risk of being consumed
through an indulgently sentimental (and apolitical) lens by curious
readers, who often turn them into consumable spectacles of savagery
and/or cleansing sentimentality.

To be sure, human rights claims operate within an already existing
economy of humanitarian consumption. In her examination of the Oprah
Winfrey Book Club phenomenon, Rita Barnard describes how certain life
narratives participate in the \"glamour of misery,\" which \"generates a
highly sentimental and commercialized form of global thinking and
feeling\" (\"Introduction\" 5). As devices for \"processing and
presenting suffering\" (Barnard, \"Oprah\'s\" 13), life narratives of
suffering and redemption are examples of what Illouz has called
\"therapeutic biography\" (qtd. in Barnard, \"Oprah\'s\" 9). I would
like to consider the way that, despite their collusion with humanitarian
rights regimes and patterns of literary consumption, these texts also
exhibit narrative strategies that can challenge complacent readings in
indirect ways. In their critical explorations of memory and community,
these narratives support, as well as test the limits of, the generic
conventions of autobiography. I suggest that they challenge literary
consumption as \"empathetic globalization\" by emphasizing local as well
as global forms of relationality. In particular, these texts employ
relational structures of address in order to place the reader as
situated, and thus implicated, within unequal global cultural, social,
and economic networks.

Alternative visions of community, citizenship, and belonging emerge in
and from these stories. Interestingly, each of these narratives traces a
movement away from the power of the gun---as both a material object and
a semiotic representation of power---and toward the healing and
pedagogical power of the pen and/or microphone, marking a clear shift in
technologies of self and community. For all three former child soldier
protagonists, it is through storytelling (written word or musical) that
some measure of healing can occur. Beah\'s account begins temporally and
spatially from his new home in North America, opening with a preface
titled \"New York City, 1998\": \"My high school friends have begun to
suspect I haven\'t told them the full story of my life. . . . \'You
should tell us about it sometime.\' Yes, sometime\" (Beah 4). This
injunction to represent himself acts as both a framing device and a
catalyst for the tale that follows, which is structured in response to
the imperative to give an account of his life as a child soldier,
specifically for Western readers.

The popular success of A Long Way Gone has been haunted, however, by
suggestions that Beah\'s memoir is in fact \"factually flawed\"
(McMahon). Mehari\'s narrative, which has recently been adapted into a
feature film, has similarly been discredited by members of the Eritrean
community in Germany. These scandals of veracity illustrate the role of
testimony in advancing human rights claims through personal narratives
and signal the more general problem of autobiography: the slippery
divide between truth and fiction and the autobiographical pact
undertaken by writer and reader alike. That is, the injunction to
present the reader with authentic experience because identity and
experience somehow confer (or undermine) credibility. In War Child, Jal
states in the preface that his account is not meant to be read as
literal history: \"The exact dates this book contains are those of
events written down in history books, but most of the everyday violence
of war never makes it into books, and this one is not meant to be a
history of a country to be read by scholars. It is the story of one boy,
his memories, and what he witnessed\" \[End Page 102\] (n. pag.). Jal\'s
\"story of one boy\" contests the official voice of dominant history.
Beah, on the other hand, specifically claims to have \"an excellent
photographic memory that enables me to remember details of the
day-to-day moments of my life, indelibly\" (51). What is more, the
paratextual inclusion of a map of Sierra Leone at the beginning of the
book and a chronology of its history at the end invite the reader to
read what is contained within the pages of A Long Way Gone as an
accurate historical account. Heart of Fire similarly features a map of
Ethiopia and Mehari and even goes one step further by including
photographs of herself and her family within the pages of the text. Why
do Beah and Mehari go to these lengths in order to insist on historical
accuracy, even though (or especially since) there is no such thing as
history that is unmediated or unselective in its arrangement of
\"fact\"?

The vehemence with which both Beah and Mehari have been attacked by
their detractors brings to mind Smith and Watson\'s observation that the
\"socio-political context of production and reception\" might lend the
narrative an \"aura of suspicion,\" especially given the \"vulnerable
social location of the narrator\" (\"The Trouble\" 360) and the
impossibility of verifying facts in certain circumstances. The privilege
of experience needs to be interrogated, as Scott suggests, since
\"experience is . . . at once always already an interpretation and is in
need of interpretation\" because identities are always \"contextual,
contested, and contingent\" (37, 36). What the scandal of truth
surrounding these narratives makes clear is both the violence in the
demand for, and the impossibility of delivering on the expectation of,
\"truth\" when it comes to relating individual traumatic experiences to
others. These narratives operate uneasily within the logic of fact and
experience, exposing the burden of memoir, where the imperative is to
\"work through\" individual trauma by making sense of it, by creatively
shaping it and making it intelligible to (and easily consumable by)
others.

[[The storie]{.underline}s]{.mark} that Jal, Beah, and Mehari recount
about their lives as child soldiers [[draw attention to]{.mark} the
difficult [relationship between **trauma** and]{.mark} representability
and the difficulty of delivering on the promise of truthful accounts in
the wake of trauma]{.underline}. Indeed, the Greek meaning of the word
trauma, understood as \"wound,\" attests to the
[\"[self-altering]{.underline}]{.mark}[, even [self-shattering
experience of **violence**, **injury**, and **harm**]{.mark},\" and as
such, \"[trauma mocks language and confronts it with its
insufficiency]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (Gilmore 6). These narrators
struggle to find ways of telling about a suffering that defies
representation. For these former child soldiers, writing in response to
the injunction to represent themselves [involves an experience of both
psychic and physical pain: Beah suffers from debilitating migraines and
\"painful memories\" that stain him like \"blood]{.underline}\" (19,
150); in an interview, [Jal admits that he experienced nosebleeds every
day during the process of writing his memoir; and Mehari lives with
\"haunting memories\" that leave her \"paralyzed with pain,\" especially
when it comes to her memories of sexual abuse]{.underline} (211,
215).[2](https://muse-jhu-edu.turing.library.northwestern.edu/article/524805#f2)

[Without effective safeguards]{.underline} in situations of armed
conflict, [the risk of children being used by fighting forces is always
present]{.underline}. The [[risk is]{.mark} at its [greatest
where]{.mark} the [state is wilfully blind to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[fact that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[recruit is a child and]{.mark}
therefore [fails to protect them]{.mark} against use in
hostilities]{.underline}. In the DRC, Myanmar, Sudan and Yemen, for
example, despite 18 having been established in national law as the
minimum age for recruitment, in practice the issue of age is
systematically ignored. Indeed [[children in these countries are
frequently targeted by]{.mark} military [recruiters and]{.mark} in some
cases [coerced into joining]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because [[the presence
of children in military ranks is]{.mark} generally [not]{.mark}
officially [acknowledged]{.mark} -- [in fact]{.mark} is [often]{.mark}
[denied]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [**[no measures are taken to prevent
their deployment]{.mark}. [As a result, children are used extensively in
hostilities]{.mark}** both in combat and non-combat roles]{.underline}
by national armies in such states.

The [[linkages between child soldiers and transfers of
arms]{.underline}]{.mark} and other military assistance [[have long been
made]{.underline}]{.mark}. More than [[15 years ago]{.underline}]{.mark}
Graça Machel, the [[UN Secretary-General']{.mark}s expert on children
and armed conflict, [found]{.mark} that the [prolif]{.mark}eration
[of]{.mark} inexpensive and [lightweight weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}
made so widely available by the international arms trade was
[[contributing to the unlawful recruitment of children]{.mark} and their
use in hostilities]{.underline}.4 The UN Secretary-General has since
[consistently point]{.underline}ed [to the correlation
between]{.underline} the easy [availability of small arms and human
rights abuses against children,]{.underline} including their recruitment
and use as soldiers, and has repeatedly called for bans on the export or
supply of small arms and military assistance to parties concerned.5 The
Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Children and Armed
Conflict [([SRSG]{.mark}) has]{.underline} likewise
[[recommended]{.mark} that]{.underline} **[[there be a ban on the
export]{.mark} or supply of arms [to groups that unlawfully
recruit]{.mark} or use [children]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}6

The UN Security Council has called for measures to curb illicit arms
transfers, including establishing effective control of transfers of
small arms which prolong armed conflict and intensify its impact on
children.7 It has expressed its intention to impose targeted sanctions,
including bans on the export or supply of small arms and other military
assistance to parties listed in the annual reports on children and armed
conflict of the UN Secretary-General that refuse to cooperate with the
UN in developing action plans to end child soldier recruitment and use
or fail to fulfil their commitments under such plans.8

Following from this, unlawful recruitment and use of children has begun
to feature among the criteria for UN sanctions, first in the DRC in 2006
and subsequently in Somalia in 2011.9 In the DRC, FARDC members are
among individuals subjected to sanctions (asset freezes and travel bans)
under this regime.10 Arms embargoes have also been imposed in both
countries to address broader security and humanitarian concerns,
although not specifically to address unlawful child soldier recruitment
and use.

[[Despite]{.mark}]{.underline} frequently repeated statements of
[[concern about the relationship between the proliferation of small arms
and child soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}, when it comes to bilateral arms
transfers, with few exceptions exporting states do not consider the
record on child soldier recruitment and use by recipient
[[states]{.mark}]{.underline} in their decision-making processes.
Indeed, for the most part they [[have neither the laws nor policies in
place]{.underline}]{.mark} on which to base such decisions. [In the [few
countries that]{.mark} [do]{.mark}, [there is little evidence]{.mark}
that [they are applied.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To Child Soldiers International's knowledge there are only three states
-- Belgium, Switzerland and the USA -- that have enacted laws to
condition arms exports specifically on a recipient country's record on
recruitment and use of children.

To this extent they are leading the way. However, a lack of publicly
available information on the application of these laws in Belgium and
Switzerland means it is not possible to assess where they have been
applied and with what effect. In the [[USA, decisions to waive
application of the legislatio]{.mark}n for two consecutive years [mean
that]{.mark} its [potential impact remains]{.mark} largely
[untested]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nevertheless the legislation of all three states provides informative
examples of what might be possible elsewhere and how [[legal
regimes]{.mark} might be [strengthen]{.mark}ed [to provide protection
against]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[possibility]{.mark} that]{.underline}
[[transfers of arms]{.underline}]{.mark} or other military assistance
could [[contribute to child soldier]{.mark}]{.underline} recruitment and
[[use in recipient states]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales fuel into child soldier recruitment\-\-- weapons arm underaged recruits and are used to force children to fight; stopping all arm transfers solves

Other states may not have legislation that specifically prohibits arms
transfers on the basis of child soldier recruitment and use, but some do
claim to have enacted laws or policies which regulate the trade in arms
based on generic human rights safeguards. In reports to the Committee on
the Rights of the Child on the implementation of the Optional Protocol,
various states have referred to this type of legislation and argued that
it can be used to prohibit the transfer of arms to countries where
children are at risk of unlawful recruitment and use. For example,
Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and the United
Kingdom have included human rights standards and other criteria
contained in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports in their national
legislation or practice.18 Other governments including Chile, Israel,
Italy, Republic of Korea, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden
and Tanzania claim that national laws or policies prohibit the transfer
of arms to governments responsible for human rights violations or more
broadly to situations of armed conflict.

[[Legislation containing]{.mark} generic [human rights criteria is
useful but]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[unless made
explicit]{.mark},]{.underline} [the [issue of child soldiers can be
easily]{.mark} [overlooked]{.mark} or ignored.]{.underline} [In practice
it is also difficult to establish how far states take the issue into
account]{.underline}. By way of a preliminary survey, Child Soldiers
International asked a small number of major arms-exporting states to
respond to a questionnaire in 2011 asking whether, how and on what basis
they took child soldiers into account when making arms transfers. [With
the exception of Sweden, [states]{.mark} asked [were unwilling or unable
to provide details of whether child]{.mark} [soldiers did feature in
decision-making processes]{.mark}]{.underline} and if so how.19

[Many states, however, have not even taken the first step of enacting
legislation on which to base decisions.]{.underline} In countries
including Argentina, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Macedonia, Sierra Leone,
Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Uganda and Ukraine the Committee on the Rights of
the Child has expressed concern at the lack of information or specific
provisions in domestic legislation that could be used to prevent the
transfer of arms when the final destination is a country where children
are known to be -- or may potentially be -- recruited or used in
hostilities.20

[B[y failing to prevent arms transfers to government forces or]{.mark}
[state-allied armed groups]{.mark}]{.underline} (or indeed armed
opposition groups) [[with]{.mark} a [record of]{.mark} unlawful [child
soldier recruitment]{.mark}]{.underline} and use these [[states risk
**contributing directly or indirectly to these
abuses.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} and other
hardware [[may]{.mark},]{.underline} for example, [[be used by underage
recruits]{.underline}]{.mark} to provide logistical support to units
into which they are incorporated, [[or by recruiters to force children
to join]{.mark} up.]{.underline}

Today, there is a significant amount of publicly available information
on where children are unlawfully recruited and used. The [[UN's
mechanism for monitoring]{.mark} and reporting on [children and armed
conflict provides data on many situations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
conclusions of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the progress
of individual states towards implementation of the Optional Protocol are
also informative about levels of risk to children of recruitment and use
by state armed forces and allied armed groups. Data on child soldier use
in a wide range of situations is also to be found in the reports of NGOs
including Child Soldiers International. On the [[basis of this
information alone, states could begin to]{.underline} [make informed
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} [about]{.underline} where and from [which
forces weapons]{.underline} and other forms of military assistance
[should be withheld.]{.underline}

To facilitate these processes, however, **[[legislation which explicitly
prohibits transfers of arms]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other military
assistance to states **[[where children are subject to or at risk of
unlawful recruitment]{.underline}]{.mark}** and use by state armed
forces or allied groups [[is an essential first
step]{.underline}]{.mark}. [To be effective, it will [also]{.mark}
[require consistency of application and]{.mark} a [greater]{.mark}
degree of [transparency by states on]{.mark} whether and [how]{.mark}
criteria relating to [child soldier recruitment]{.mark} and use [are
informing export decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**This card talks about how using the UN list of child soldiers is the
best method for states to decide who gets an embargo so would probably
be useful if we decide to word the plan that way.**

### Arms sales key

#### Arms sales are key

P.W. **Singer 05,** former director of the Center for 21st Century
Security and Intelligence and a senior fellow in Foreign Policy at
Brookings, 1/1/05, "The New Faces of War"
<https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/singer20051215.pdf>

Transforming a child into a fairly effective combatant is disturbingly
simple. It begins with recruitment, [either through abduction or
"voluntary" means]{.underline}. Recruitment is rapidly followed by cruel
but straightforward methods of training and conversion. Brutality and
abuses of the worst kind underscore each stage, but these lie in part
behind the overall program's usual effectiveness. The ultimate aim of
the process is to foster a child's dependency on an armed organization
and inhibit escape. Case studies indicate that in the majority of
conflicts, [[a widely used method of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[recruitment
of children is **some form of abduction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Typically, recruiting parties are given conscription targets that change
according to the group's needs and objectives. For example, the Union of
Congolese Patriots for Reconciliation and Peace (UPC/RP),
[a]{.underline} [militia led by Thomas Lubanga in eastern Congo, has a
policy that each family within its]{.underline} [area of control must
provide a cow, money, or child to the group.]{.underline}42 Often, the
groups are more efficient. For example, the LRA in Uganda sets numeric
goals for child recruits and sends raiding parties into villages to meet
them.43

The decision of where groups carry out their operations to find their
recruits is also based on planned efforts to maximize the efficiency of
their efforts. [The most frequent targets]{.underline} [are secondary
schools or orphanages, where children of suitable size are collected in
one]{.underline} [place, but out of contact with their parents, who
would try to spirit them away]{.underline}. Indeed, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) even took to setting up a unit formed
exclusively of orphans, the elite Sirasu Puli (Leopard Brigade).44 The
Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) and Rwandan Patriotic Army
(RPA) are two other groups that also target schools almost exclusively,
using kidnapping or coercion to pull in kids. [Another common target
area is the marketplace. For instance, during the Ethiopian]{.underline}
[fighting in the 1990s, [a common practice was]{.mark} **[that armed
militias would simply surround]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[the public
bazaar]{.mark}**. They would order every male to sit down [and then
force into a truck]{.mark}]{.underline} [[anyone deemed
"eligible."]{.mark} This often included minors.]{.underline}

Homeless or street children are at particular risk, as they are most
vulnerable to sweeps aimed at them, which prompt less public outcry. In
Sudan, for instance, the government set up camps for street children,
and then rounded up children to fill them in a purported attempt to
"clean up" Khartoum. These camps, however, served as reservoirs for army
conscription.45

Other groups that are in frequent danger are refugee and IDP (internally
displaced persons) populations. In many instances, families on the run
become disconnected. Armed groups then target unaccompanied, and thus
more vulnerable, minors.

[Not all children are forced into soldiering, though. Many may "choose"
to join an armed group]{.underline} and thus the groups that use them
often claim they broke no moral codes. The rough trend line seems to be
that nearly two out of every three child soldiers have some sort of
initiative in their own recruitment. For example, estimates are that 40
percent of the FARC's child soldiers are forced into service, and 60
percent joined of their own volition.46 Another survey in East Asia
found that 57 percent of the children had volunteered.47 Finally, a
survey of child soldiers in four African countries found that 64 percent
joined under no threat of violence.48

[To describe this choice as voluntary, however, is greatly
misleading]{.underline}.49 The most basic reason that children join
armed groups is that they are driven to do so by forces beyond their
control. [[A particularly strong factor is economic.]{.mark} Hunger and
poverty are endemic in conflict zones. [Children,]{.mark} particularly
those orphaned or [disconnected from civil society, may]{.mark}
volunteer to [join]{.mark} any group [if they believe that this is the
only way to guarantee regular meals, clothing, or medical
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one young boy in the DRC explained,
"I joined \[President Laurent\] Kabila's army when I was 13 because my
home had been looted and my parents were gone. As I was then on my own,
I decided to become a soldier."50 Indeed, surveys of demobilized child
soldiers in the DRC found that almost 60 percent originally joined armed
groups because of simple poverty.51 The same ratio was found in a
separate survey of child soldiers half the globe away in East Asia,
indicating a broader international trend.52

[[Children may also join]{.mark} armed organizations [for
protection.]{.mark} Surrounded by violence and chaos, [children may
decide they are safer]{.mark} in a conflict group[, **with guns in their
own hands, than going about by themselves
unarmed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, a good portion of girl
soldiers who join as "volunteers" cite domestic abuse or exploitation as
the underlying reason for joining.53

[Innocent children have been tricked into joining with extraordinary or
impossible promises to which only gullible children would give
credence]{.underline}. In Sierra Leone, for example, the RUF promised
poor rural children that fighting would help them escape the poverty and
misery many of them had known all their lives[. As one child fighter
describes, "They told us we'd all have our own vehicle. They told us
they'd build houses for us. They told us many things."54 In Liberia,
Charles Taylor promised that every child fighting for his group would
get a computer if he won the war]{.underline}.55

Many children may have personally experienced or been witness to the
furthest extremes of violence, including massacres, summary executions,
ethnic cleansing, death squad killings, bombings, torture, sexual abuse,
and destruction of home or property. Thus, vengeance can also be a
particularly powerful impetus to join the conflict.56

[Lastly, some groups may take deliberate advantage of the fact that
adolescents are at a stage in life where they are still defining their
identity]{.underline}. Conflict groups offer what are perceived as
glamorous or honorable roles (soldier, hero, leader, protector), as well
as membership and acceptance in a group. These messages are particularly
seductive in areas where children feel the most powerless or victimized.
[One survey of child soldiers in Africa found that [15 percent
volunteered because they were simply fascinated by]{.mark} the prestige
and thrill of serving in a unit and **[having a
gun]{.mark}.**]{.underline}57

## Framing

### Children First

#### The government has full obligation to prioritize issues of children rights violations -- it's the core of human rights in society

Victims of Armed Conflict to Reintegration and Recovery" SSRN- elibrary
that provides research papers

Following the conclusion of armed conflicts,
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[have duties
to]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[take all]{.mark}]{.underline} appropriate
[[measures to promote physical and psychological
recovery]{.mark}]{.underline} and social reintegration [[of a child
victim of any form of]{.underline}]{.mark} neglect, exploitation or
abuse, torture or any form of cruel, [[inhuman]{.underline}]{.mark} or
degrading [[treatment]{.underline}]{.mark} or punishment, or [[armed
conflicts.]{.underline}]{.mark}"12 Among many of
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} CRC's [[fundamental
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, those most applicable to the circumstances
faced by child soldiers include: (1) "the right of the child to be
protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that
is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or
to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual,
moral or social development";13 as well as the duties of states to (2)
"prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking
of \[narcotic drugs and psychotropic\] substances";14 (3) protect
children against sexual exploitation, sexual abuse,15 and all other
forms of exploitation prejudicial to the child's welfare;16 (4) prevent
the sale and trafficking of children;17 and (5) to ensure treatment of
the child with humanity and respect for inherent dignity of a human
person, "taking into account the needs of persons of his or her age."18
The Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Involvement of Children in Armed
Conflict more extensively implements these protections by requiring
states to: (1) ensure that the members of their armed forces under
eighteen years of age do not take a direct part in hostilities; (2)
raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces
from fifteen to eighteen years of age; (3) ban compulsory recruitment of
persons below the age of eighteen; and (4) prohibit independent armed
groups within their territories from recruiting persons below
eighteen.19 To date, there are 139 states parties to this Optional
Protocol.20 Child soldier enlistment is now subject to international
criminal prosecution. Admittedly, neither the statute of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ("ICTY") nor
that of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ("ICTR")
explicitly mention the crime of child soldier enlistment. However,
subsequent [[international tribunals have]{.underline}]{.mark} since
[[recognized child soldier enlistment as a **war
crime.**]{.underline}]{.mark} The first international judgment on child
recruitment began with the May 2004 decision of the Appeals Chamber of
the Special Court for Sierra Leone in the Hinga Norman case.21 In Hinga
Norman, the Appeals Chamber defined child recruitment as the
conscription, enlistment, and use of children under 15 years of age to
participate in hostilities. According to the Appeals Chamber, these
activities had already been outlawed under customary international law
since at least 1996.22 A year later, the International Criminal Court
("[[ICC]{.underline}]{.mark}") [[included the crime of child
soldier]{.underline}]{.mark} enlistment [in]{.underline} its [[first set
of arrest warrants,]{.mark}]{.underline} issued against members of the
Lord's Resistance Army ("LRA") in Uganda23 and members of armed groups
in the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC").24 On January 26, 2009, the
ICC commenced trial in Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga. As officially
defined, child soldiering encompasses not only direct combat
participation, but all modes of participation in armed groups'
activities in their conduct and prosecution of armed conflicts. The 1997
Cape Town Principles and Best Practices on the Recruitment of Children
into the Armed Forces and on Demobilization and Social Reintegration of
Child Soldiers in Africa ("Cape Town Principles") explicitly defines a
child soldier as "any person under 18 years of age who is part of any
kind of regular or irregular armed force in any capacity, including but
not limited to cooks, porters, messengers, and those accompanying such
groups, other than purely as family members. It includes girls recruited
for sexual purposes and forced marriage. It does not, therefore, only
refer to a child who is carrying or has carried arms."27 This definition
recognizes the wide scope of conflict-related activities for which armed
groups put children to use, as first narrated in the groundbreaking 1996
Report of Gra¸ca Machel to the U.N. As officially defined, child
soldiering encompasses not only direct combat participation, but all
modes of participation in armed groups' activities in their conduct and
prosecution of armed conflicts. The 1997 Cape Town Principles and Best
Practices on the Recruitment of Children into the Armed Forces and on
Demobilization and Social Reintegration of Child Soldiers in Africa
("Cape Town Principles") explicitly defines a child soldier as "any
person under 18 years of age who is part of any kind of regular or
irregular armed force in any capacity, including but not limited to
cooks, porters, messengers, and those accompanying such groups, other
than purely as family members. It includes girls recruited for sexual

child who is carrying or has carried arms."27 This definition recognizes
the wide scope of conflict-related activities for which armed groups put
children to use, as first narrated in the groundbreaking 1996 Report of
Gra¸ca Machel to the U.N. General Assembly on the Impact of Armed
Conflict on Children.28 The International Labour Organization (ILO)
likewise acknowledges the definitional nexus between child soldiering
and child labor. Accordingly, the [[ILO categorizes child soldiering as
among the **"worst forms of child labor"**]{.underline}]{.mark} in ILO
Convention No. 182,29 an international treaty ratified by about 165
states,30 and which obligates states parties to take preventive and
remedial measures against such worst forms of child labor. According to
the 2008 Child Soldiers Global Report ("CSG Report"),
[[despite]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[increased internationalization of
legal protections]{.underline}]{.mark} to prevent child soldiering,
[[tens of thousands]{.mark}]{.underline} (although possibly reduced from
initial estimates of around 300,000 in 2001) of child soldiers
[c[ontinue to be actively involved in]{.mark}]{.underline} armed
[[conflicts in Afghanistan]{.mark},]{.underline} Burundi, Central
African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, the DRC, India,
Indonesia, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Myanmar,
Nepal, the Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, and
Uganda.31 The decrease in child soldiering might be attributed, in some
degree, to the collective efforts of international institutions. From
1999 to 2005, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolutions 1261 (1999),
1314 (2000), 1379 (2001), 1460 (2003), 1539 (2004) and 1612 (2005),
which collectively outline a system of mechanisms and programs for
country-specific and region-specific fact-finding, reportorial, periodic
review, support, and monitoring of States' compliance with international
obligations on child sol

### Conflict reccurence

#### Child Soldiers pose a threat to national security

Rachel **Stohl**, February 12, **2018**

"Child Soldiers Pose a National Security Threat"
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/child-soldiers-pose-national-security-threat-24470>

The recruitment and use of child soldiers are not crimes of desperation
or opportunity, but represent a deliberate strategic process to sustain
conflict. **[[Child soldiers are often seen as expendable and
replenishable, and do not require significant training or
investment.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And although children in conflict are
unlikely to change the tempo of warfare or provide significant strategic
advantage to one side or another, **[[they can sustain conflict and
fulfill much-needed positions such as porters, spies, cooks and
combatants---thus extending the length and lethality of conflicts and
sustaining conditions that perpetuate the conflict's
continuation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is therefore important to frame
policy discussions to attend to the perceived strategic incentives (and
disincentives) of using children in conflict, and identify effective
ways to ultimately end the recruitment and use of child soldiers.

To combat the reliance on children as tools of warfare, governments can
train military leaders on the risks and inefficiencies of relying on
children to fight their wars. The Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative,
run by former Canadian Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, who served as the force
commander for the UN Mission in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, has
taken such an approach to eradicate the use of child soldiers. The
initiative works with governments to implement trainings that educate
military leaders on the dangers and pitfalls of using child soldiers, as
well as inform them of the international legal frameworks that protect
children from exploitation in armed conflict. The initiative also aims
to adapt military doctrine to better help national armed forces prepare
for the possibility of confronting children in combat. In March 2017,
Canada became the first country to adopt such a doctrine.

Governments can also leverage military assistance to dissuade foreign
militaries from recruiting and using children in combat. To date, very
few countries have linked these issues and implemented national
legislation that conditions arms sales and military assistance on a
country's record of using or supporting the use of child soldiers. Such
initiatives have been undertaken by Belgium, Switzerland and the United
States to augment broader efforts to get children off the battlefield.
Although the conversation on child soldiers often falls off
national-security agendas---or to a lower-tier priority---there are
numerous opportunities to enhance efforts to prevent and ultimately end
the recruitment and use of children in combat.

In the United States, one such effort is the Child Soldiers Prevention
Act (CSPA), which seeks to encourage countries to stop recruiting and
using child soldiers by leveraging U.S. security assistance. Under the
CSPA, countries identified by the State Department as using or
supporting the use of child soldiers are prohibited from receiving U.S.
weapons and certain types of military assistance, unless they receive a
waiver from the president. **[[The United States has invoked such
national-interest waivers more often than not, however, and allowed
nearly \$1.7 billion in military assistance to flow to thirteen
countries known to use/support the use of child soldiers since the CSPA
was enacted---thereby effectively giving a pass to governments that
routinely exploit children in their national militaries or
government-supported armed groups.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Adolescents, former child soldiers and post-conflict (in)stability
[[Although]{.mark} there are [several]{.mark} pioneering [studies
deal]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark} questions of how willingness and
opportunity influence **conflict recurrence**, and how former combatants
influence [**post-conflict instability**, none of them take]{.mark}s the
potential role of former [child soldiers]{.mark} explicitly [into
account]{.mark}]{.underline} (Collier, 2000; Fortna, 2003; Kreutz, 2010;
Mason et al., 2011; Quinn et al., 2007; Rustad and Binningsbø, 2012;
Toft, 2010; Walter, 2004, 2014). There is, however, one approach that
specifically links youth to the (re)occurrence of conflict: the
'youth-bulge' literature. The youth-bulge work follows the more general
debate on security implications of population pressure and resource
scarcity (Urdal, 2011). It is founded on the rationale that large
cohorts of young (especially male) people, the so-called 'youth bulges',
make countries more susceptible to civil wars (Leahy et al., 2007;
Mesquida and Wiener, 1996; Schwartz, 2010; Urdal, 2006, 2008; Urdal and
Hoeschler, 2009). Youth bulges potentially increase both the opportunity
and willingness of rebel groups to (re-)engage in political violence.
Considering the opportunity side, Collier (2000: 94) suggests that
relatively large youth cohorts facilitate recruitment through the
abundant supply of 'rebel' labour with low opportunity costs (e.g.
Urdal, 2006; see also Yair and Miodownik, forthcoming). Scholars also
argue that the opportunity for rebellion among adolescents is boosted by
a weak government with limited capability to inflict losses on the
rebels (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004; Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Urdal,
2006: 609). In terms of the willingness perspective, it is frequently
emphasized that institutional crowding on the labour market or the
educational system, lack of political openness, and crowding in urban
centres causally link youth bulges and conflict onset or recurrence
(e.g. Braungart, 1984; Choucri, 1974; Goldstone, 2001; Urdal, 2011). For
example, Moser and Rodgers (2005) argue that [violence is strongly
associated with **unequal access** to employment, education, health and
basic physical infrastructure]{.underline}. [Situations of widespread,
severe inequality, then, heighten the potential for alienated,
frustrated and excluded populations and, particularly, [younger
men]{.mark} to [engage in violence]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also
Goldstone, 2001). This is also confirmed by Brett and Specht (2004), who
found strong micro-level support for the expectation that [poverty, a
**lack of schooling** and low alternative income opportunities are
important reasons for joining a rebel group]{.underline} (see also
Collier, 2000). The (implicit) assumption of the youth-bulge literature
is that young people suffer more from marginalization and relative
deprivation than other groups, and that they are more likely to resort
to violence once they are aggrieved (Hilker and Fraser, 2009: 17). This
assumption is made more explicit in the so-called 'blocked transition to
adulthood' approach. Its underlying argument is that the structural
exclusion and lack of opportunities faced by young people in many
countries effectively blocks or prolongs their transition to adulthood
(i.e. leaving the parental home and setting up new living arrangements,
finishing full-time education, or settling into a stable source of
livelihood) and can lead to frustration, disillusionment and,
ultimately, engagement in violence (Barker and Ricardo, 2005; Curtain,
2001; Hilker and Fraser, 2009: 19). In light of this, some scholars
argue that the social and economic status required for adulthood is
increasingly unattainable for young people (Hilker and Fraser, 2009: 18;
see also Richards, 1996; Utas, 2005, 2008; Uvin, 1998). For example,
Utas (2005: 150) describes that many male Liberian adolescents are
unable to become socially accepted as men because they have been unable
to achieve the cultural mandates of building their own house and getting
married. This corresponding frustration and discontentment among young
people can result in taking up arms and (re-)engaging in political
violence. Against this background, even if youth is considered to be of
special importance for conflict (re-)emergence, existing approaches do
not focus per se on the role that former child soldiers play and how
this particular group differs from those youngsters that were not
recruited by rebel groups. As we argue in the following[, [former child
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} [could be an additional mechanism within
the willingness and opportunity framework, [lead]{.mark}ing to [a
**higher risk of conflict recurrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the best
of our knowledge, we offer the first systematic account of the impact of
former rebel child soldiers on post-conflict stability in a country. In
light of those works that discussed the consequences of child soldiering
before (e.g. Blattman and Annan, 2010), we argue that there are at least
two avenues that especially link (the experiences of) former child
soldiers to the willingness and opportunity for the recurrence of
conflict in post-conflict societies: educational/economic drawbacks; and
psychological harms (see also Singer, 2006: 185). These two factors
ultimately lead to lower recruitment costs for rebel organizations in a
post-conflict environment, which induces the risk of conflict recurrence
(see also Urdal, 2006: 609; Yair and Miodownik, forthcoming). First,
[compared to children who have not been recruited by rebel groups,
[former]{.mark} child [soldiers]{.mark} are more likely to [experience
economic disadvantages due to]{.mark} a **[lack of education]{.mark}**
after a conflict has ceased. [The resulting **economic
weakness**]{.mark} in post-conflict states may then [motivate the
**recurrence of**]{.mark} **fighting**]{.underline}. [This argument
belongs to the willingness cluster of the theoretical framework on
conflict recurrence, but also includes elements of opportunity as former
child soldiers already have the skills for and are 'acquainted with'
**violent [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Brett and McCallin (1998:
134), for instance, suggest that former child soldiers often find
themselves alienated from the traditional means of livelihood as they
never had the opportunity to obtain the skills that underpin the
economic bases of their communities once they lay down weapons.
Consequently, economic issues due to a lack of education weigh
especially heavily on former child soldiers (Wessells, 2006: 202).3
Similarly, Blattman and Annan (2010) show that rebels' child soldier
recruitment in Uganda had a negative impact on former child soldiers'
(post-conflict) education and earnings due to the lack of civilian
schooling.4 [According to these scholars, this [education deficit
**impedes labour-market success**]{.mark}: while former child soldiers
are just as likely to be employed, [they are **half as likely** to
be]{.mark} engaged [in skilled work, and]{.mark} they [earn
**wages**]{.mark} **that are [lower by a third]{.mark}**. The fact that
former child soldiers in particular suffer economically is also
confirmed by research on the challenges that former child soldiers faced
in Mozambique and El Salvador]{.underline} (e.g. Boothby et al., 2006;
Santacruz and Arana, 2002). [In other words, former child soldiers may
have **no skills other than killing and being able to fieldstrip
weapons**]{.underline} (Singer, 2006: 111), [and [future life
**prospects are dimmed**]{.mark} for them in the wider
region]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} may significantly [raise the
willingness]{.mark} of former child soldiers [to start fighting
again]{.mark} since recruitment costs are reduced (from the perspective
of the rebel group) [and rejoining a]{.mark} rebel [group might
ensure]{.mark} at least [access to]{.mark} basic necessities and
supplies, such as [**food, shelter** and]{.mark} so on, and perhaps even
a higher **[income]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see also Barnitz, 1997;
Honwana, 2006; Wessells, 2010). A Liberian child soldier, for example,
told Human Rights Watch (2004, quoted in Wessells, 2006: 168): \[f\]or a
while, I did some small jobs around Monrovia, but there was not much to
do and I could not afford to go back to school. So two years ago, I
decided to join the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy
(LURD). I figured I was better to fight and try to get something, than
hang around town doing nothing. As such, rejoining rebel groups might be
the only viable outside option that former child soldiers have in
post-conflict societies.

### 2AC -- Foreign Aid Fails

#### Foreign Aid fails to solve poverty and end corruption -- money is used to bribe and silence political enemies instead of their intended purposes

James M. **Roberts 18**, Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation and
master's degree in international and development economics from Yale, et
al. 3/12/18, "Should the U.S. Continue Giving Billions in Foreign Aid?"
PDF

NO Since the end of World War II, American taxpayers have watched their
government spend more than \$3 trillion on foreign aid. The time has
come for significant cuts. That\'s because [most [aid projects]{.mark}
have [fail]{.mark}ed [to solve]{.mark}]{.underline} the long-term
problems of [[poverty and bad governance]{.mark}, and they will never be
able to succeed.]{.underline}

The biggest problem with foreign aid is that [[it]{.mark}]{.underline}
often [[goes to countries that have]{.mark} troubled histories and
[deeply entrenched problems.]{.mark} In]{.underline} many of [these
countries, the]{.underline} most [basic functions of government
are]{.underline} totally [unreliable.]{.underline} For example[,
[Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Haiti have received billions]{.mark}
in]{.underline} U.S. [aid]{.underline} in recent years [[but remain
corrupt, unstable, or undemocratic.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Too often, [foreign aid]{.underline} actually reinforces these problems,
[mak]{.underline}ing [it harder]{.underline} for countries [to fight
corruption and establish]{.underline} more-[democratic
institutions.]{.underline} That\'s because [foreign
[aid]{.mark}]{.underline} can [[help]{.mark} corrupt [regimes remain in
power by giving]{.mark}]{.underline} them [[money and]{.mark}
good-paying [jobs for them to hand out as perks.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Sometimes [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} unscrupulous [[regimes
receive]{.mark}]{.underline} American foreign [[aid]{.mark} funding [to
fight]{.mark} against [corruption]{.mark}]{.underline} in their
governments[, [they use it to target]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[political enemies.]{.underline}]{.mark} Sadly, we see this [happening
in South Sudan]{.underline} right [now.]{.underline}

### 1AR -- Foreign Aid Fails

#### Foreign aid fails -- it has become an industry and doesn't seek to evaluate the context of developing nations

Tom **Dichter 2017**, Cultural anthropologist, worked in 60 developing
countries for foreign aid agencies, 4/21/17, "I've worked in foreign aid
for 50 years---Trump is right to end it, even if his reasons are wrong,"
https://qz.com/959416/time-to-end-foreign-aid-but-for-the-right-reasons/

It is striking that the aid establishment has not dug deeper into the
reasons why. It has not listened to four decades of trenchant critiques,
many of them by insiders. Countless articles and at least thirty widely
read books about aid (such as Michael Maren's 1997 The Road to Hell: The
Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity, or William
Easterly's 2006 The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid
the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good, or Dambisa Moyo's
2009 Dead Aid), have pointed out that [outsiders cannot "nation
build,"]{.underline} that [[development must be led by]{.mark} the
[people in]{.mark}]{.underline} the poor [[countries]{.mark}
themselves]{.underline}, that dependency has been one of the few
tangible results of the trillions we have spent, that [the complexity
and [the context-specific nature of each country]{.mark}'s politics,
social structure, and culture [cannot be easily understood by outsiders
and thus]{.mark} the [short term three to five year aid "project" is a
wildly inappropriate vehicle for aid]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so on.
Moreover, a number of highly respected historians and economists like
David S. Landes and J.K. Galbraith have pointed out that [aid simply
cannot produce development.]{.underline} Here is British development
economist Peter Bauer in 1974:

[[What holds back many poor countries is the people who live there,
including their governments.]{.mark} A society which cannot develop
without external gifts is altogether unlikely to do so with
them.]{.underline}

Not only does the [[aid establishment]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to
ignore the critics, it [has [dumbed down]{.mark}]{.underline} much of
its work. [There are now [thousands of ongoing projects]{.mark} that
[amount to band-aid solutions where the results of]{.mark} "our"
[interventions disappear almost immediately after the departure
of]{.mark} our "expert" [teams]{.mark} in their Land
Cruisers]{.underline}: new water wells dug in villages where previous
donor-built wells have failed; countless capacity-building workshops
attended by poor people who are often motivated by the "sitting
allowance"---a cash gift; tools given out to farmers who then sell them;
projects that attempt to convert sex workers into sellers of samosas on
the streets of Addis Ababa without realizing that the money they make in
the sex trade is far greater than anything else they can do;
microfinance projects in South Sudan where the economy is so bad that
there is no money for anyone to buy what a "micro-entrepreneur" might
have to sell. There are more ineffective projects like these than ever,
all presented as world-changing in the aid agencies' marketing campaigns
(see the websites of USAID or of any major international NGO).

The main reason there is so little change is that [[aid has become an
industry]{.mark}, and is rapidly moving towards]{.underline} what a
present day Eisenhower might call [an "aid-industrial complex," an
interlocking set of players]{.underline} ([NGOs, government
agencies]{.underline}, and private contractors, among others) who have
largely closed off outside criticism and internal learning and [become
self-referential and entrenched. The [main goal of this complex is to
keep the money flowing.]{.mark} In 2014, thirty-three of the top 40
USAID vendors were American non- and for-profit firms and their total
business with USAID was \$5.53 billion.]{.underline} And these are only
the top vendors. There are scores of other US organizations that get a
piece of the American aid pie in the form of contracts and agreements.

#### Foreign aid doesn't work

Doug **Bandow 11**, March 7,2011,"U.S. Foreign Aid Hinders More Than It
Helps",
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/us-foreign-aid-hinders-more-it-helps>

[The United States will run up a record \$1.65 trillion deficit in 2011.
Yet Washington keeps subsidizing foreign government]{.underline}s. House
Republicans have targeted foreign aid. This year the State Department
would lose 16 percent of its budget; humanitarian aid would drop by 41
percent.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warns of catastrophe: "Cuts of this
magnitude will be devastating to our national security, will render us
unable to respond to unanticipated disasters and will damage our
leadership around the world." Moreover, the proposed reductions will be
"detrimental to America's security."

Even some conservatives stand with Clinton on this issue. For instance,
Jennifer Rubin, The Washington Post's in-house blogger on the right,
termed Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, a "neo-isolationist" for
proposing to cut what amounts to international welfare[.\[[T\]here is
little ev]{.underline}]{.mark}[idence [that foreign assistance advances
U.S. interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Despite Clinton's extravagant claims, there is little evidence that
foreign assistance advances U.S. interests[. The U.S. provided]{.mark}
some [\$30 billion to Egypt ove]{.mark}r the last [three]{.mark}
[decades]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [country remains poor and
undemocratic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, aid to the corrupt Mubarak
dictatorship helped turn Egypt into popular volcano.

[[Pakistan has been on the U.S. dole and performing disastrously]{.mark}
for decades. [The]{.mark} [waste]{.mark}, [inefficiency]{.mark} and
[corruption surrounding humanitarian projects]{.mark} in Afghanistan and
Iraq [are]{.mark} [legendary]{.mark}.]{.underline} What of the \$27
billion in so-called development assistance requested for next year?
These outlays have had no discernible impact on Third World economic
growth.

No doubt some projects in some countries have provided some benefits.
But there is no correlation between aid and growth. Indeed, generous
financial transfers to corrupt dictators often have impeded necessary
reforms.

Aid advocates now claim to do better. President George W. Bush created
the Millennium Challenge Corporation to reward governments with good
policies. Yet, reported the Washington Times last August, the agency "is
giving billions of dollars to nations upbraided by the State Department
for corruption in government."

[The World Bank also has emphasized better governance. However, reported
Tom Porteous, the London director of Human Rights Watch, "[multibillion
dollar programs funded by the World Bank]{.mark} and others [have been
politicized and manipulated by the Ethiopian government]{.mark} and are
[used as a powerful tool of political control and
repression]{.mark}.]{.underline}" Aid incentives are all wrong.

[[The international dole has created]{.mark} long-term [dependency and
discouraged reform]{.mark}. Even humanitarian aid has a disappointing
record.]{.underline} Six months after the earthquake in Haiti, reported
the Wall Street Journal, "the process of reconstruction appears to have
come to a halt." U.S. "Food for Peace" shipments, used to dump farmers'
domestic surpluses, are notorious for ruining local farmers and thus
undermining local production. This problem continues in Haiti.

On returning from a private aid mission, Don Slesnick, the mayor of
Coral Gables, Florida, complained: "We were saddened to see rice bags
travel no more than 20 (meters) from the gates of the distribution site
before ending up in the back of a pickup truck presumably headed for the
black market. To our further dismay, we returned home to read news
stories that those very same donations were undercutting Haitian rice
farmers who needed income to support their own families."

Worse is Somalia. Reported the New York Times last year: "[As much as
half the food aid sent to Somalia is diverted from needy people to a web
of corrupt contractors, radical Islamist militants and local United
Nations staff members."]{.underline}

Two decades ago Michael Maren worked with private aid organizations in
Somalia and concluded: "Separately we'd arrived at the conclusion that
the relief program was probably killing as many people as it was saving,
and the net result was that Somali soldiers were supplementing their
income by selling food, while the \[insurgent force\] --- often
indistinguishable from the army --- was using the food as rations to
fuel their attacks into Ethiopia."

Washington and other industrialized nations, like Japan, should
reconsider the aid business. Financial transfers rarely are necessary
for the West's defense. The Cold War is over and America's allies,
including regional powers Israel and Turkey, should have graduated from
U.S. assistance years ago.

Most Third World nations are tangential at best to American or allied
security. While it's harder to criticize humanitarian aid, private money
spent by private organizations is the best way to help those in need
around the world.

As for economic development, officials in wealthy industrialized nations
should focus on improving their own economic policies and easing access
of other nations to the international marketplace.

Despite foreign aid's abysmal record, the Obama administration continues
to back the program. Clinton should listen to her own rhetoric: "It's
time to retire old debates and replace dogmatic attitudes with clear
reasoning and common sense."

One of those dogmas is the assumption that foreign "aid" acts as
assistance rather than hindrance. With America drowning in red ink[,
[Washington must cut unnecessary programs]{.underline}]{.mark}[. So must
its friends and allies. [Misnamed foreign aid is a good place to
start.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## AT: Exec CP

### Solvency Deficit -- Signaling/Credibility

#### The executive has no credibility -- officials defend Trump's unpopular decisions, which degrades public image -- the CP can't solve human rights signaling

Paul **Waldman 19**, PhD in Communication from University of
Pennsylvania, writer for the Washington Post, 1/8/19, "No one in the
Trump administration has any credibility left,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/01/08/no-one-trump-administration-has-any-credibility-left/?utm_term=.648d6bcbdfe8

But there's something else going on here, too. [This
[admin]{.mark}istration [is so morally]{.mark} and intellectually
[degraded]{.mark} that **[there is not a single]{.mark} major [figure
within]{.mark} it [who retains credibility]{.mark}** with the press or
the public.]{.underline} In the midst of a political crisis, there is no
administration official whose word we can take on anything.

For context, I want to look back on a relevant episode from the recent
past[. In 2002 and 2003, George W. Bush's administration was waging one
of the great propaganda efforts in U.S. history to convince the public
that if we didn't invade Iraq, Saddam Hussein would soon attack us with
his fearsome arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.]{.underline} As
Vice President Richard B. Cheney put it in a speech, "Simply stated,
there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass
destruction; there is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against
our friends, against our allies, and against us."

This was a lie, and though most of the public seemed to be buying it, as
it approached the time when Bush was ready to launch the invasion, the
administration needed a rhetorical coup de grace to make the momentum
for war unstoppable. So [they turned to Secretary of State Colin
Powell]{.underline}, a former general who was not only known to be
harboring some skepticism about the case for invading, but [who
was]{.underline} also [held in]{.underline} such [high esteem by both
the news media and the public]{.underline} that not only would he be
given the benefit of the doubt, but just about anything he said would be
assumed to be unimpeachable.

[Powell gave a speech to the U.N. Security Council in February 2003,
laying out the administration's case for war]{.underline} --- a speech
we would later learn was as full of falsehoods, distortions and
tendentious claims as everything else coming out of the administration
at the time. But the reception to the speech, just as the administration
hoped, was positively rapturous. Such was Powell's reputation that if he
said it, nearly the entire news media concluded, it had to be true.

The point of this story is that [Powell's credibility was a potent
resource on which the administration could draw.]{.underline} It
happened that they drew on it in service of propagating lies to enable a
catastrophic war, but in theory they could have drawn on it to justify
something worthwhile.

But [try to imagine something like that happening today.]{.underline}
Which of President Trump's senior aides would be able to come before the
public and say, "These are the facts, and this is what we must do about
them," and be taken seriously?

Indeed, these days [[when]{.mark} admin]{.underline}istration
[[officials do interviews, they're forced to]{.mark} spend much of their
time [defend]{.mark}ing the [lies]{.mark} their boss has told on the
issue at hand.]{.underline} That's what happened when [Vice President
[Pence did a round of interviews to make the case that we're facing a
"crisis" on the border that justifies a **government shutdown** and the
**declaration of a national emergency**]{.mark} that would allow Trump
to exercise powers not ordinarily available to the
president.]{.underline} Pence's ability to spin was put to the test,
with sad results, as he was questioned about Trump's lie that previous
presidents told him they wished they had built a wall on the southern
border, and the lie the administration is telling that thousands of
suspected terrorists have been apprehended trying to come in from
Mexico.

The vice president isn't going to convince anyone who isn't already in
Trump's camp of what the administration would like the country to
believe. The president's press secretary may be the most shamelessly
dishonest person ever to occupy that post, which is saying something.
The secretary of homeland security is a joke. The acting attorney
general is a widely viewed as a contemptible sycophant grossly
unqualified for his position. And [[the person with the highest
reputation]{.mark} among Trump officials, [former defense secretary Jim
Mattis, just quit in disgust.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Congressional signaling overrules prior executive actions -- checks on arms sales reigns in Trump and reasserts Congressional control over foreign policy

Nicole **Austin-Hillery 19**, Wasserstein Public Interest Fellow Harvard
Law School and executive Human Rights Watch Director, et al. 1/7/19,
"Congress Should Put Human Rights First at Home and Abroad. Prove Some
Americans Care."
https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/07/congress-should-put-human-rights-first-home-and-abroad-prove-some-americans-care

On foreign policy, although the executive branch has predominant power,
[Congress can be a vital check while also vigorously promoting a foreign
policy that]{.underline} not only defends but also [safeguards basic
rights. [Congress can let both allies and adversaries know]{.mark} that
[even if]{.mark} the [White House isn't invested in human rights
promotion]{.mark} overseas, [the rest of America
is.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Congress can]{.underline} also aggressively [influence U.S. foreign
policy by using [the power of the purse]{.mark} to [ensure]{.mark} that
[U.S. programs and policies]{.mark} overseas [align]{.mark} more
[explicitly with]{.mark} the [promotion of basic
rights.]{.mark}]{.underline} And building on bipartisan support in the
current Senate, Congress should permanently repeal the "Global Gag
rule," which restricts the use of U.S. funds for programs critical for
women's health care abroad.

It should also take up legislation in other areas on which the
administration has failed to engage constructively, including forced
political re-education camps in China's Xinjiang region and the need to
make human rights a key element of US relations with Saudi Arabia.
[[Systematically blocking weapons sales to repressive leaders]{.mark}
would rein in President Trump's commercially centered approach to arms
transfers while also [send]{.mark}ing [a clear message: the US will not
be complicit in]{.mark} other countries' [war
crimes.]{.mark}]{.underline}2

[[Congress needs to course-correct on rights]{.underline}]{.mark}

Regular [oversight hearings should explore the
admin]{.underline}istration['s uncritical support of autocratic and
abusive governments]{.underline}, including in Hungary, Poland and
Thailand. Congress should look at the State Department's move to strike
reproductive rights from its annual global human rights report, and the
troubling likelihood that Sudan will be removed from the state sponsors
of terrorism list. Finally, regular [meetings with and statements to
support independent activists, journalists and lawyers as well as
overseas travel are all ways Congress can revive a more inclusive and
rights-respecting foreign policy.]{.underline}

[As lawmakers lay out their agenda]{.underline} and attempt to repair
the damage done over the last two years, [a crucial part of their
leadership requires asserting basic rights as a core policy
component]{.underline} --- whether domestic or foreign. That\'s not just
the right thing to do, [it is in America's best interests.]{.underline}

#### Trump is unpredictable in foreign policy -- flip flopped on issues like NATO, Syria, and China -- weakens leveraging power of the CP because leaders will expect him to reverse

Jane C. **Timm 17**, political reporter at NBC News, 5/12/17, "Tracking
President Trump\'s Flip-Flops,"
https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/president-trumps-first-100-days/here-are-new-policy-stances-donald-trump-has-taken-election-n684946

When it comes to James Comey, President Donald [Trump has flipped and
flopped and flipped]{.underline} yet again on the former FBI director.

[Overall, [Trump has taken 32 new stances on 13 different issues since
his election]{.mark}.]{.underline} The president's [[shifting
agenda]{.mark} has [established him as]{.mark} one of the most
[unpredictable]{.mark} American leaders in modern history.]{.underline}

Call it the post-platform era: [The
[president-elect]{.mark}]{.underline} ran and [won a campaign in which
he [took 141 policy positions on 23 issues over]{.mark}]{.underline} the
course of [[510 days.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Trump defended]{.underline}
this [as being \"flexible\" and unpredictable]{.underline}, something he
argued would make him a better leader.

Most recently, the abrupt firing of the director of the FBI was bungled
when the president contradicted the White House\'s official explanation
of the surprising decision

In order to better understand the president, we\'ve [tracked Trump\'s
new policy pronouncements and flip flops]{.underline} on big issues from
Election Day forward.

FBI Director James Comey\'s Performance and Firing

Where Trump Stood During the Election

As a candidate, Trump\'s view on Comey\'s performance centered around
whether opponent Hillary Clinton was under investigation at the time.
When Comey wasn\'t recommending charges, Trump lashed out, saying the
system was \"rigged\"; when Comey was investigating Clinton, Trump was
far friendlier and expressed respect and support for the FBI for
targeting his political adversary.

After the Election

1\. \'I respect him\'

Asked after the election if he\'d want to keep Comey along, Trump
demurred but noted that he respected the FBI head. \"I respect him a
lot. I respect the FBI a lot,\" he said on CBS News days after his
victory. Two days after inauguration, he quipped at a reception that
Comey had become \"more famous than me.

2\. FBI can\'t find the leakers

3\. It\'s not too late to fire him, but \'I have confidence in him

Weeks after Comey first confirmed the FBI was investigating the Trump
campaign\'s ties to Russia, Trump again expressed confidence in the FBI
director but teased that it might change.

\"It\'s not too late \[to ask Comey to step down\], but, you know, I
have confidence in him. We\'ll see what happens, you know, it\'s going
to be interesting,\" Trump said.

4\. Comey gave Clinton \'free pass

Trump began lashing out at the former FBI director on May 2nd, alleging
in a two-part tweet exchange that Comey gave Clinton a \"free pass\" and
\"was the best thing that ever happened\" to her.

5\. On May 9, Trump fired Comey

Comey was learning of his own dismissal while working at a Los Angeles
FBI field office. White House Communications Director Sean Spicer said
\"accepted the recommendation of the attorney general and the deputy
attorney general regarding the dismissal.\"

6\. Would have fired him anyway

In an explosive NBC News exclusive, Trump said that he made the decision
himself to fire Comey and would have done so regardless of any
recommendations, while arguing that the FBI director had let Clinton off
too easy and condemning the FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties
to Russia.

Current position: Trump made the decision himself, despite Vice
President Pence and Trump aides initially saying that it was a team
effort and based on advice the president had received from top
officials.

Health Care

Where Trump Stood Before the Election

Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Opposed to cuts to Medicaid
and Medicare. For the most part, he promised to cover everyone though
his proposals did not.

After the Election

1\. Some parts of Obamacare could stay

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal three days after the
election, Trump indicated that he wanted to keep the protections for
patients with pre-existing conditions, and the measure that allows
parents to keep their children insured until age 26.

2\. \"Proud to endorse\" a House bill that doesn\'t fully repeal
Obamacare, cuts Medicaid and would cause millions to lose insurance

In March, Trump supported the health care bill House Republicans put
together, even though it broke his own promises on health care.
Republicans on the right mostly opposed the bill for not fully repealing
Obamacare, while Democrats and moderate Republicans opposed it because
it sharply cut Medicaid funding.

When it became clear it would not pass the Republican-controlled House,
House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the bill before it reached a vote.

Trump: \'Evolving\' Health Care Bill \'Gets Better and Better\'

APRIL 20, 201700:59

Current position: While still maintaining that Obamacare must go, Trump
was last heard supporting a health care bill that cut Medicaid and would
kick millions off their health care, a partial reversal of his
pre-election stance.

Immigration Reform, Enforcement

Where Trump Stood Before the Election

During the campaign, Trump promised to overhaul the immigration system,
but he and his surrogates took a variety of positions on the issue.
Trump at various times said there would or wouldn\'t be a pathway to
citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.
He also vowed to deport the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented
immigrants repeatedly throughout his bid, and while he shifted on the
issue repeatedly, he never disavowed this initial plan.

After the Election

1\. Start with the criminals, decide on the rest later

Making good on his campaign promises to start with criminal immigrants,
Trump told \"60 Minutes\" that they\'d start with immigrants before
deciding on others.

\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have
criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these
people, probably two million, it could be even three million," he said
in the interview, citing debunked math. "We are getting them out of our
country or we are going to incarcerate. But we\'re getting them out of
our country, they\'re here illegally. After the border is secured and
after everything gets normalized, we\'re going to make a determination
on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people."

2\. Open to compromise on reform, as well as a pathway to citizenship

In a White House event with television anchors, he signaled his openness
to compromise and a pathway to citizenship.

"The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is
compromise on both sides," he told them, in remarks that were later
reported by several outlets.

3\. Deport undocumented immigrants, regardless of whether they\'ve
committed a crime

Despite his promise to focus on criminals, more than twice the number of
immigrants without criminal records were arrested this year under Trump
compared to the same time last year, according to data obtained by the
Washington Post. One so-called DREAMer, a protected undocumented
immigrant who was brought to the U.S. as a child, has also been
deported.

Current position: Deport undocumented immigrants with or without
criminal records, but potentially open to compromise on immigration
reform.

Entitlement Programs

Where Trump Stood Before the Election

Trump promised repeatedly not to touch entitlements. \"I\'m not going to
cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I\'m not going to
cut Medicare or Medicaid,\" he told The Daily Signal in May, in an
article the Trump team put on their own website under the headline,
\"Why Donald Trump Won\'t Touch Your Entitlements.\"

After the Election

1\. Reform Medicaid and Medicare

Trump\'s transition website has launched and now promises reforms to the
program, including modernizing Medicare and offering \"flexibility\" to
states administering Medicaid for \"innovative\" solutions. These are
vague references at reform, but hint at the kind of reforms the rest of
his party --- and particularly House Speaker Paul Ryan --- has long
championed.

Families Affected: Talking to People About GOP Health Care Bill\'s
Impact

MARCH 23, 201701:41

2\. Cut Medicaid by 25 percent

The Trump-supported GOP healthcare bill cut Medicaid spending by \$880
billion by 2026, a quarter less than its current spending. The CBO
estimated that 14 million Medicaid patients would lose coverage in that
time. The bill failed to reach a vote in the House, in part because some
felt the cuts to Medicaid were too harsh.

Current position: \"Reform\" entitlements and cut Medicaid.

LGBTQ Rights

Where Trump Stood Before the Election

During the Republican primary, Trump said he supported "traditional"
marriage and said he opposed the Supreme Court ruling that effectively
legalized gay marriage and would consider appointing justices to the
Supreme Court who would favor reversing the decision.

During the campaign, he also said he\'d be comfortable with Caitlyn
Jenner using whichever bathroom she preferred in Trump Tower, speaking
out against the North Carolina bill that barred people from using public
bathrooms that didn\'t correspond with the sex listed on their birth
certificate.

After the Election

1\. "Fine" with marriage equality

Trump said days after his election in a 60 Minutes interview that he's
"fine" with gay marriage now that it's been \"settled\" by the Supreme
Court.

2\. No need to count LGBTQ people in the Census

Questions counting LGBTQ people in the 2020 Census draft were quickly
removed from an early draft. The Department of Commerce called the
inclusion of LGBTQ Americans an \"error,\" saying there was \"no federal
data need\" to count LGBTQ Americans

3\. Reversing Obama-era protections of transgender students

Trump\'s administration reversed an Obama-era protection for transgender
students that allowed them to use the bathroom that corresponded to
their gender identity in public schools.

Current position: He\'s \"fine\" with gay marriage, but how his
administration will approach other issues concerning LGBTQ Americans is
unclear

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}

Where Trump Stood [[Before the Election]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Trump labeled]{.mark} the military alliance
\"[obsolete]{.mark}\"]{.underline} and said he might not honor the
treaty if other member nations do not pay what he thought they should.

[[After the Election]{.underline}]{.mark}

1\. Honor NATO, but other members must pay more

[[Trump affirmed his support]{.underline}]{.mark} for the organization
in February, saying "we strongly support NATO.\"

"We [only ask that all of the NATO members make]{.underline} their full
and [proper financial contributions]{.underline} to the NATO alliance,
which many of them have not been doing. Many of them have not been even
close," he said

Candidate Trump: NATO is obsolete, Pres. Trump: No it isn\'t

[APRIL 12, 2017]{.underline} 00:25

2\. [NATO is \"no longer obsolete\"]{.underline}

"The secretary general and I had a productive discussion about what more
NATO can do in the fight against terrorism," Trump said April 12 at a
joint press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. "I
complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now
they do fight terrorism."

Trump's claim that NATO changed its policies because of his complaints
is not new, but it is false, according to PolitiFact.

Current position: NATO is no longer obsolete, and the United States will
not withdraw from the longstanding alliance.

[Intervention in [Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}

Where Trump Stood [[Before the Election]{.underline}]{.mark}

As a candidate, [[Trump spoke out against intervening]{.mark} in foreign
governments and America\'s conflicts in the Middle East.]{.underline} He
publicly dismissed the views of his own vice presidential pick after
Mike Pence supported a tougher stance on Syria\'s brutal government in
his debate.

"Syria is fighting ISIS," he said in October, noting that he and Pence
\"disagree\" on the issue. Later that month, Trump told The Guardian
that "what we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on
Syria."

[[After the Election]{.underline}]{.mark}

1\. Strike the Syrian regime

As a private citizen, Trump advocated strenuously that his predecessor
not attack Syria. But after international onlookers determined that
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime had once more used banned
chemical weapons on its own citizens, Trump --- reportedly influenced by
daughter Ivanka ---decided to act. [The [U.S. fired 59 cruise missiles
at]{.mark} the [Syria]{.mark}n air base]{.underline} determined to be
involved in the attacks.

2\. Assad\'s role is \"uncertain"

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Syrian leader\'s future was
\"uncertain\" less than a week after the administration said it
acknowledged the \"political reality\" that Assad was in control of the
nation.

Current position: Trump struck Syria for its use of chemical weapons.
It\'s unclear yet whether this is an outlier based on the circumstances,
or a significant shift in policy on Syria.

Special Interests in Government, \"Drain the Swamp\"

Where Trump Stood Before the Election

Trump promised ethics and lobbying reform in October, vowing to
institute a five-year ban on executive branch officials taking lobbying
roles after they leave government service, and encourage Congress to do
the same. "It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C," Trump said
then, vowing to make government "honest once again."

After the Election

1\. Lobbyists can be part of the White House transition

On November 13, in his first televised post-election interview, Trump
defended his decision to include a slew of lobbyists in his transition
team by arguing that "everyone down there" is a lobbyist and that he'd
"phase it out."

2\. Lobbyists can\'t be part of the transition

On November 15, Vice President-elect Mike Pence ordered a removal of all
lobbyists from the transition. It\'s unclear if all the registered
lobbyists, of which there are at least nine, have left their positions.
On Nov. 17, the transition announced that candidates being vetted for
high posts in the administration must prove that they are no longer a
lobbyist.

3\. Deregistered lobbyists are OK

Individuals who wished to work with the transition team were permitted
to deregister as lobbyists before securing employment.

4\. Staff the White House with ex-Goldman Sachs executives

Trump appointed three high-powered, wealthy alums of the investment bank
--- Steve Bannon, Gary Cohn, and Steve Mnuchin --- to top positions
within his White House, after decrying Wall Street and in particular
Goldman\'s influence in politics throughout the campaign. It sent stock
for the firm surging.

5\. Make it easier for lobbyists to join the administration, make it
harder for staffers to lobby after leaving the White House

As president, Trump signed an executive order mandating executive branch
staffers to pledge to never lobby on behalf of foreign govern

ments, and refrain from lobbying domestically for five years after
leaving the White House.

But he made it easier for lobbyists to work in his White House,
weakening an Obama-era restriction that barred past lobbyists from
working in the agencies they sought to change for two years.

6\. Let some former lobbyists work on the issues they'd lobbied on

Trump added a restriction that former lobbyists joining his White House
couldn't work on specific matters they'd lobbied on, but ProPublica
found at least three people working on the very issues they'd lobbied
the past White House on, noting that the White House could have issued
waivers to exempt these hires from the ethics rulings but the public
would not know, because the White House had also stopped disclosing such
waivers.

Current position: Replace the swamp.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}

Where Trump Stood [[Before the Election]{.underline}]{.mark}

During the campaign, [[Trump derided China as a currency
manipulator]{.underline}]{.mark}, arguing that they are "raping our
country" with their trade policy. He vowed to designate China a currency
manipulator on day one in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, later making the
same promise for the first 100 days in his Contract with the American
Voter.

[[After the Election]{.underline}]{.mark}

1\. China is not a currency manipulator

On April 12, [[Trump changed course]{.mark} on China entirely,
[telling]{.mark} the [W]{.mark}all [S]{.mark}treet [J]{.mark}ournal that
[he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator]{.mark} in an upcoming
report because they weren't currently manipulating their currency and he
felt it would jeopardize his talks with the nation over North
Korea.]{.underline}

### [Solvency Deficit -- Executive Orders Temporary]{.underline}

#### Executive orders can be revoked -- succeeding presidents often revoke previous orders, Congress and the courts can -- only the plan is a permanent condition

Sarah **Kessler 17**, deputy editor of Quartz, 1/31/17, "There are three
ways to revoke a US president's executive orders, and they rarely
succeed," https://qz.com/898683/can-an-executive-order-be-revoked/

[The president can revoke, modify, or supersede any executive order:
**[Presidents often undo the executive orders of their
predecessors]{.mark}**, but they have rarely retracted or overridden
their own executive orders.]{.underline} "This early on, to admit that
you've made such a huge mistake would be very politically damaging,"
says Alvin Tillery, an associate professor of political science at
Northwestern University. "And I think that the response with protests
and so on, it would just give further fodder to people who want to
challenge \[Trump's\] policy positions."

[[Congress can revoke]{.mark}, modify, or supersede an executive order
[if]{.mark} the [president was acting under authority granted by
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark} But if Congress makes changes
that the president disagrees with, it can expect to face a presidential
veto, which it could only override with a two-thirds vote in both the
House and the Senate. One 2006 study (pdf) cited by the Congressional
Research Service found that only about 4% of executive orders have been
modified by Congress. "Usually when they do act, it's to provide funding
to an executive order, or to build an executive order into a statutory
framework," says William Howell, a professor of American politics at the
University of Chicago, who has written extensively about executive
power. "They fortify an executive order."

[[Courts can declare an]{.mark} executive [order illegal or
unconstitutional.]{.mark}]{.underline} Barring several notable
exceptions however, the courts do not regularly overturn presidential
actions. In Howell's book Power without Persuasion: The Politics of
Direct Presidential Action, he attempted to identify every court case
that has challenged an executive order between 1945 and 1998. In 83% of
them, the courts ruled in favor of the president.

Despite the historical infrequency of executive orders being revoked
within the same presidential term as they are issued, Trump's
immigration order has already changed. The US Department of Homeland
Security issued an order on January 29 essentially exempting legal
permanent US residents from the ban. Though agencies sometimes clarify
their interpretation of an executive order, Howell says the DHS action
was fairly unusual. "In the aftermath of most executive orders, if not
silence, there is at least broad acquiesensce," he says "Presidents
usually vet them, they talk to key political actors, get their input ...
The subjects that would require clarification, whoever writes the order
is usually aware of them and provides clarity in order."

On January 28, a federal judge also issued an emergency stay against the
executive order in response to the ACLU lawsuit, which was brought on
behalf of two Iraqi men detained at JFK International Airport in New
York. The ruling temporarily prevented the government from deporting
some people who had already arrived at airports in the US.

[While checks on executive orders may not be used frequently, they do
place limits on presidential power]{.underline}, Howell says. "A
president, in principle, could write whatever they want in an executive
order, but [**[it would be wrong to conclude]{.mark} that** **[president
can remake the political universe in his image]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
he asserts. "There are [meaningful institutional checks]{.underline}
that [apply]{.underline}."

### Solvency Deficit -- Circumvention

#### The executive defines the CSPA around their own interests -- vague language leaves too much room for abusive interpretations -- Congress redefining the statute is key

the Act\'s Inadequacy Leaves the World\'s Children Vulnerable\",
California Western International Law Journal: Vol. 43 : No. 1 , Article
12., https://scholarlycommons.law.cwsl.edu/cwilj/vol43/iss1/12

C. Interpretation of the CSPA

It is clear that [[the Legislature intended]{.mark} the [CSPA to be more
effective than it has proven to be]{.mark} in reality]{.underline}.
Congressman Jeff Fortenberry, one author of the CSPA, issued a press
release in June 2011 that urged President Obama to seriously enforce the
statute because the countries that were granted the 2010 waivers made
insufficient progress in combatting their use of child soldiers.\'9 4 It
is further obvious that the authors of the statute are exasperated
because [the President is not effectuating Congress\'s intent in
implementing the law.]{.underline} After the 2011 waivers, Congress
tried to enhance the CSPA by proposing an amendment that would require
the President to provide Congress a report no later than fifteen days
before issuing another waiver. 195 The report is to specify \"what
credible and verifiable steps\" violating countries are taking to
prevent further recruitment of child soldiers and how it is demobilizing
current child soldiers.\' 96 The proposed amendment also adds
Peacekeeping Operation Funds to the list of prohibited military
assistance. 197

The above amendment, while improving the statute\'s enforceability to
some degree, will not completely fix the flaws in the statute\'s
wording. [A prima facie reading of the statute illustrates that the
fault predominantly lies with the severely brief and vague language that
comprises the prohibition and its limitations. [The statute purports to
establish a general ban on certain military assistance to governments
identified as recruiting child soldiers, with a national interest
waiver. While Congress argues that the waiver was intended to be \"rare
and temporary,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} 198 [the statute\'s language does
not evidence this restricted use]{.underline}. The waiver\'s language in
its entirety states that \"\[t\]he President may waive the application
to a country of the prohibition in subsection (a) if the President
determines such waiver is in the national interest of the United
States.\"1 99 [Read on its face, the statute gives the President
absolute discretion to determine what constitutes a situation that is in
the \"national interest of the United States.\"]{.underline} 200

[Congress\'s assertion, that the President is failing to implement the
CSPA according to their intentions, begs the question, what did Congress
intend when it authored the statute? [It is extremely difficult to
ascertain the legislators\' intent,]{.mark} on the statute\'s face,
[because the \"plain meaning\"]{.mark}]{.underline} 201 [[of the
language leaves much to be desired]{.underline}]{.mark}. The statute
fails to define \"national interest,\" or explain what \"steps\" a
country must complete to have assistance reinstated. Nor does the
statute indicate what constitutes \"reasonable steps to implement
effective measures to demobilize child soldiers. . . .\"202 It would
seem, [therefore]{.underline}, that [[the same body who issues the
waivers, the executive branch, has discretion to define these vague
terms.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Current [status quo]{.underline} interpretations of the CSPA get [circumvented]{.underline}\-\--Presidential [waivers]{.underline} find [loopholes]{.underline}\-\--Congress [amending]{.underline} it is [key]{.underline} to enforcing it

[[Despite]{.mark} clear [Congressional]{.mark}
[intent]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the CSPA would prevent our government
from funding militaries that recruit child soldiers]{.underline}, [[a
presidential loophole]{.mark} [renders the CSPA
ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This loophole allows [the
President]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[waive]{.underline}]{.mark} the
assistance [[prohibition if]{.mark} it is [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
\"[[national interest]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. \"13 [Due to [this]{.mark}
[waiver]{.mark}]{.underline}, numerous [[countries known to recruit
child soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[continued to
receive]{.underline}]{.mark} full or partial
[[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} for the past two years.14 Another
provision allows reinstatement of assistance if the country makes
changes to comply with the CSPA\'s terms (including signing an action
plan and demobilizing child soldiers).15 Of the six countries identified
by the State Department as having recruited child soldiers,16 four have
received waivers or reinstatement of assistance.17 [The]{.underline}
language of the [CSPA is short and vague]{.underline}, [making it nearly
impossible for the President to implement]{.underline} its [provisions
according to Congress\'s intent]{.underline}. [[If Congress wants the
Act to help prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} war-tom countries from
[[recruiting child soldiers, **the Act must be

### Solvency Deficit -- Trump

#### Trump shouldn't be in charge of arms sales --has no regard for human rights

membership organization that promotes public understanding of and

exert responsible oversight on trump's dangerous approach to arms sales"
<https://www.armscontrol.org/issue-briefs/2019-01/congress-exert-responsible-oversight-trumps-dangerous-approach-arms-sales>

In December, the Senate issued a stunning rebuke of President Donald
Trump's support for Saudi Arabia and its actions in the bloody war in
Yemen, which are exacerbating a massive humanitarian crisis. A
bipartisan group of 56 Senators took the [extraordinary
step](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-01/news/senate-bucks-trump%E2%80%99s-saudi-approach) of
invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution to direct the president to cease
direct [U.S. military engagement in the war, including through any
aerial refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft fighting there--a step that
had garnered steam since nearly winning approval in [March
2018](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news/trump-touts-saudi-arms-sales).]{.underline}

In a separate measure, the Senate said by voice vote that it "believes
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the murder" of
journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi---a finding the president
has not fully supported.
[[Trump's [refusal](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-11/news-briefs/murder-puts-heat-saudi-arms-deals) to
hold the prince accountable and to consider suspending arms sales to
Saudi Arabia]{.mark} in response to the grisly murder further
[underscores his **retreat** from common-sense U.S. and international
norms regarding international arms sales.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump's lack of concern about human rights and harm to
civilians]{.mark} caused by U.S. arms trade partners]{.underline} is
not, however, surprising. The [conventional arms transfer
policy](https://www.armscontrol.org/issue-briefs/2018-06/trump-favors-arms-industry-effort-loosen-export-controls) his
administration issued in April 2018 [[**dangerously** **elevated**

implementing that plan and a related factsheet
on [sales](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/11/287214.htm) agreements
again stress his administration's desire to expedite the sale of
increasingly more weapons, citing as success agreements to supply
American arms to repressive regimes in not just Saudi Arabia, but also
Bahrain and Nigeria.

### Perm do the CP

#### Both Congress and the President have authority on arms sales -- the CP is one way the plan could be enacted

Vanessa Patton **Sciarra 88**, Vice President for Legal Affairs and
Trade & Investment Policy at the National Foreign Trade Council, J.D.
from Yale Law School. 1988, "Congress and Arms Sales: Tapping the
Potential of the Fast-Track Guarantee Procedure"
https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7154&context=ylj

As in many areas of foreign policymaking, 6 [[both Congress and the
President]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[claim]{.mark} some [constitutional
power to authorize arms sales.]{.mark}]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [v. Curtiss-Wright Corp.]{.underline}17 is often
cited to [support claims of broad executive powers in foreign
affairs.]{.underline} Language in the opinion celebrates the \"very
delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ
of the federal government in the field of international relations-a
power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of
Congress .. .\"18 Supporters of a strong executive role in foreign
affairs have seized on this conception and argued that the opinion
confirms a constitutionally-based general foreign affairs power for the
Executive. 19

[The [general foreign affairs power, in tandem with article II\'s
enumerated grants of power]{.mark}, can be read to [support the
President\'s claim]{.mark} to constitutional authority in the arms sales
area.]{.underline} The commander-in-chief clause has historically been
seen to provide the Executive with wideranging power over military
matters even in peacetime.20 Further, the President may derive some
power in this area from the grant of general executive power in article
II.21 Historically, Presidents have relied on the aggregation of these
powers to make executive agreements covering a wide range of
intergovernmental relations, 22 and this power can be seen as an
additional ground for assertion of executive power in this area.23

But ironically, given that dicta in Curtiss-Wright suggests an
independent role for the President in foreign affairs generally, the
holding in the case supports a less expansive view of the President\'s
power in the arms sales area. [The Supreme Court found that the
statute]{.underline} at issue in that case, [[granting]{.mark} to the
[President]{.mark} the [power to prohibit]{.mark} the [sale of arms to
certain countries]{.mark}, did [not]{.mark} contain an
[unconstitutional]{.mark} delegation of legislative power.24 The holding
thus concedes that Congress has a role to play in arms
sales.]{.underline} The Court would have been hard pressed to argue for
executive independence in the making of arms sales given the strong
congressional claims to participate in arms sales. [[Congressional
claims]{.mark} are [derived from]{.mark} the [foreign commerce
clause]{.mark},]{.underline}25\" [the \"spending power,\"]{.underline}
26 [the power to dispose of U.S. property,]{.underline} 27 [the
necessary and proper clause]{.underline} 28 [and Congress\' general
foreign affairs power.]{.underline}29

### Perm do Both

#### Perm solves best --president and congress solves bc combo of forign rlations and trade policy powers

Shayerah Ilias **Akhtar 18**, Author for the Congressional Research
Service, 11/1/18 "U.S. Trade Policy Functions: Who Does What?"
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF11016.pdf>

At the nexus of foreign and domestic policy, U.S. trade policy comprises
a distinct set of issues that shape U.S. participation in the global
economy and relations with trading partners. It also affects the U.S.
economy as a whole, specific sectors, firms, and workers, and the
overall standard of living of Americans. Cross-cutting in nature, U.S.
trade policy has many "voices" and is controversial at times.
Historically, it has focused on supporting economic growth and jobs
through more open and rules-based trade by negotiating and enforcing
reciprocal trade agreements and other measures, while offering relief to
specific segments of the U.S. economy affected by import competition and
"unfair" foreign trade practices. It also aims to promote trade and
investment, while regulating these flows for national security, health,
safety, and other reasons. Other goals are to support economic
development in developing countries and expand U.S. influence abroad.
[The [Constitution gives **Congress** primacy over **trade**
**policy**]{.mark}, specifically the power to levy tariffs and [regulate
**foreign** **commerce**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By contrast, [the
P[resident]{.mark} lacks specific authority over trade, but [has power
over foreign affairs]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [role of the executive
branch in trade stems from the **President's** power to **negotiate**
**treaties** with other nations, and legislative grants of authority to
adjust tariff rates and implement trade policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and many other agencies
conduct U.S. trade and international economic functions under various
statutory and administrative authorities. USTR-led systems to coordinate
U.S. trade policy among the agencies and obtain input from public and
private stakeholders aim to balance diverse interests to reach a unified
U.S. government "voice" on trade matters. This architecture has evolved
over time to reflect changes in international trade, the U.S. economic
position, and other factors. Periodic proposals on trade reorganization,
as well as newer debates over the balance of power on trade, have
rekindled congressional interest in examining U.S. trade functions.

#### CP causes infighting with Trump -- Republican Senators oppose withdrawal of US military support in Afghanistan and Syria -- groups which the CP would cut off arms sales to. 

Catie **Edmonson 19**, reporter for the New York Times, 1/31/19, "Senate
Rebukes Trump Over Troop Withdrawals From Syria and Afghanistan,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/senate-vote-syria-afghanistan.html

WASHINGTON --- The [[Senate]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a bipartisan rebuke
to President Trump's foreign policy, voted [overwhelmingly]{.underline}
to advance legislation drafted by the majority leader to [express strong
[oppos]{.mark}ition to]{.underline} the president's [[withdrawal
of]{.mark} United States [military]{.mark} forces [from Syria and
Afghanistan.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [68-to-23 vote]{.underline} to cut [of]{.underline}f debate ensures
that the [amendment]{.underline}, written by Senator Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky and [backed [by virtually every Senate
Republican]{.mark}]{.underline}, will be added to a broader bipartisan
Middle East policy bill expected to easily pass the Senate next week.

The vote was the second time in two months that a Republican-led Senate
had rebuked Mr. Trump on foreign policy. In December, 56 senators voted
to end American military assistance for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen in
what was the strongest show of bipartisan defiance against Mr. Trump's
defense of the kingdom over the killing of a dissident journalist, Jamal
Khashoggi.

This time, the vote was even more lopsided. Mr.
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s [[declaration of victory
over]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}slamic
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tate [[provoked]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[swift
backlash]{.mark}]{.underline} on Capitol Hill in December [when he
ordered]{.underline} that the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[pull]{.underline} 2,000 [troops]{.underline} from Syria and 7,000 from
Afghanistan.

Mr. McConnell, usually a reliable ally of the president's, drafted an
amendment warning that "the precipitous withdrawal of United States

#### Conventional counterterror fails without human rights promotion\-\--prevents future extremism\-\--the plan's key to prevent recruitment

The second initiative, [[an **integrated approach**]{.mark}, calls for
establishing human rights norms as an integral component in the other
two models. [To be effective,]{.mark} the law enforcement and military
[models must place primacy on human rights norms]{.mark} or the reaction
to these models will multiply resistance. [**Terrorism is indefinitely
prolonged** when]{.mark} counter-terrorism [measures **ignite**]{.mark}
**greater [violence]{.mark}** and tap the reservoir of the disaffected,
thus increasing recruitment and **[creating]{.mark} several [new
terrorists]{.mark}** for each one apprehended.]{.underline} By stemming
abuses within the other models, [[the integrated approach
circumvents]{.mark} such terrorist [recruitment.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The U.N. [global strategy recognizes the importance of these human
rights initiatives]{.underline} as well as the need for the other two
models and opts for a holistic strategy that incorporates all three
models.1 8 The key to the U.N. global strategy for combating terrorism
is the overlap and intra-dependence of each of the models in order to
address the problem, comprehensively utilizing all available approaches.

Dissuading the disaffected from choosing terrorist tactics 9 X Denying
terrorists the means to carry out attacks20 X Deterring state support
for terrorism21 X Developing state preventative capacity22 X X X
Defending human rights in the struggle against the scourge of terror
This chart demonstrates the holistic approach incorporated by the
Secretary-General\'s \"five D\'s.\" \"Dissuading the disaffected from
choosing terrorist tactics\"\' 24 is the principle strategy of the stand
alone human rights model and, [[while]{.mark} the [other models may
serve]{.mark} some [deterrent value]{.mark}, the **[use of force has
never been]{.mark} an [effective]{.mark} tool** [for changing]{.mark}
opinions or curbing overzealous and [extremist
outlooks]{.mark}]{.underline}. The strategy of \"\[d\]enying terrorists
the means to carry out attacks\" 25 references the availability of
weapons and the vulnerability of potential targets and is best addressed
by the investigatory capabilities of the law enforcement model.
Theoretically, [this strategy could be realized under the other models,
too. For example, [terrorist org]{.mark}anization[s require
people]{.mark}, so **[curtailing recruitment]{.mark}** of, killing, or
capturing existing personnel may [impede attacks]{.mark}. However, such
interaction is too attenuated and is already accounted for in the other
strategies]{.underline}. \"Deterring state support of terrorism\" 26 is
a military strategy. The deterrent value of an armed attack is most
effective when dealing with state entities. \"Developing state
preventive capacity\" 27 is a task that requires an approach employing
multiple models. Under the military model, military aid can create state
preventive capacity. Under the law enforcement model, the free exchange
of information, law enforcement techniques, and technologies can foster
increased arrests of terrorists. [[Under the **h**]{.mark}uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights [model,]{.mark} particularly the stand-alone
initiative, [a]{.mark} more **[grass-roots approach]{.mark}** builds
infrastructure and [relieves]{.mark} the [**underlying misery** that
pushes]{.mark} ordinary people into [extremism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[[integrated **h**]{.mark}uman **[r]{.mark}**ights initiative
[keeps]{.mark} the [other]{.mark} two [models in]{.mark} [check]{.mark},
preventing their excesses from providing terrorist organizations a
factual basis for pro-terrorist propaganda.]{.underline} The strategy of
\"\[d\]efending human rights in the struggle against the scourge of
terror\"28 involves all three models, both in terms of preventing
terrorist attacks and in ensuring that counter-terrorist measures
conform to acceptable standards. This tripartite structure is designed
to maximize the effectiveness of each of the three models and to provide
a synergy that exceeds the sum of the component parts. Each model is
less effective by itself; alone, the military model lacks prevention and
moral certainty, the law enforcement model lacks strength to act
globally against state-sponsored terrorism, and the human rights model
lacks enforcement capability. [[The]{.mark} human rights [model]{.mark}
implied by the High-level Panel\'s recommendations [increases]{.mark}
the [effectiveness of the other]{.mark} model[s]{.mark} and represents a
**break from traditional counter-terrorism policy**]{.underline}.29 It
does so by ensuring that both law en28. Id. 29. [Traditionally, human
rights played little role in U.S. counter-terrorism policy]{.underline}.
During the 1980s, U.S. counter-terrorism policy was concerned with
fostering cooperation between federal agencies including the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the Federal
Aviation Administration. The policy acknowledged the threat posed by
state-sponsored terrorism and \"outlined guidelines for preventing and

### 2AC -- CT Fails

#### Counterterror policy fails\-\--its overgeneralization breeds Iraqi extremism\-\--lack of reform ensures continued failure

Hanny **Megally**, 3-12-20**19**, Senior Fellow at New York University's
Center on International Cooperation focusing on violent extremism, human
rights and rule of law and Vice-President for Programs at the

Counterterrorism Approach Risks Undermining Success against ISIS,\"

ezc

Counterterrorism Law No. 13 To begin with, [[counterterror]{.mark}ism
[law]{.mark} no. [13]{.mark} of 2005 [is]{.mark} amazingly brief---six
articles---and prescribes only two penalties: death or life
imprisonment.]{.underline} The death penalty can be applied to a wide
range of actions, from simple affiliation and causing damage to property
to using explosives and seeking to overthrow the government. As the
American Bar Association noted[, the language is "**[overbroad and
ambiguous]{.mark}**. It encompasses serious and petty crimes, ranging
from mass killings to vandalism.]{.underline}" Life imprisonment is
meted out to those attempting to cover up these acts or harboring
someone involved in such acts. One explanation for why the language of
this law is vague and punishments are so severe is the difficulty in
gathering evidence to charge individuals with specific crimes.
Essentially, [[suspects are prosecuted for]{.mark} violating
[the]{.mark} counterterrorism [law rather than]{.mark} for [murder,
slavery, torture, rape, or other]{.mark} serious
[crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Another explanation is the
oft-heard refrain that punishment is what the population has demanded
after the trauma of ISIS. And, [certainly, there is justification for
wanting to severely penalize those responsible for mass murder,
indiscriminate killings, kidnapping, sexually abusing and enslaving more
than three thousand Yazidi women and girls, and the massacre of 1,700
mainly Iraqi Shia army cadets from Camp Speicher.]{.underline} As a
result, [[the Iraqi government has **detained more than 19,000**]{.mark}
people on terrorism-related charges since 2013 and convicted at least
8,861, with at least 3,130 sentenced to death. Human Rights Watch
reported that **one judge** in Nineveh had held **5,500 hearings in 2017
for ISIS suspects** and handed down 200 death sentences]{.underline}. So
back to discussions in Baghdad. Practically [[everyone]{.mark} you speak
to---the judiciary, bar association, think tanks, civil society, and the
UN---[agrees]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} counterterrorism **[law needs to
change]{.mark}**, and that [it risks]{.mark} doing [more harm than
good]{.mark}.]{.underline} The fear is that [[its
**broad**]{.mark}**-brush [approach]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} create the
types of grievances that may **[rekindle]{.mark} support** for violent
[extremism or **resurrect ISIS**]{.mark} in a new form]{.underline}. The
survey conducted by Revkin in Mosul shows that the state should not
assume that the Iraqi people uniformly support or demand the severest
punishment for all individuals suspected of association with ISIS. [When
questioned about their preferred punishment for collaboration with ISIS,
33 percent of respondents chose the death penalty while 28 percent opted
for no punishment at all.]{.underline} What becomes clear is [those
surveyed differentiate between the type of collaboration and the
corresponding severity of punishment]{.underline}, with fighters
consistently receiving the harshest punishments while others such as
janitors or taxpayers to ISIS meriting more moderate punishments. Within
this differentiation, 67 percent opted for less severe punishments (no
punishment, community service, or 3--15 years of imprisonment). Winning
the war but losing hearts and minds While [a draft law amending the
counterterrorism law is floating around in Baghdad, there appears to be
little momentum or political will to push it through.]{.underline} One
reason is that [the resort to harsh punishments is an extension of an
entrenched militarized and securitized policy to defeat and eradicate
ISIS.]{.underline} We can certainly see elements of that in the
heavy-handed screening of those trying to leave formerly ISIS-controlled
areas. At times [this [approach]{.mark} [is based on]{.mark} "wanted
lists or [accusations]{.mark} by community members [with **no**]{.mark}
**further [evidence]{.mark}**" [and]{.mark} has [led to suspects]{.mark}
swept up in this dragnet [spending]{.mark} many **[months in
detention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We have also seen it in the coercive
policies of forced displacement and rehabilitation of those who are
under suspicion. For example, Mosul Council is reported to have issued a
decree in June 2017 ordering the expulsion of all families of ISIS
members, and it proposed a "special camp where they can be rehabilitated
psychologically and ideologically." Such [[camps are]{.mark} now in
existence in Iraq, [holding **tens of thousands**]{.mark} of civilians
waiting for screening and permission to be able to leave or return home.
The militarized approach may have been needed to win back territory
taken by ISIS, which at one time governed or had control over 20 cities
and a civilian population of 5 million. But as the battle has shifted
from winning the war to winning hearts and minds, [the policies]{.mark}
and strategy [need to shift. By painting]{.mark} everyone [with the same
brush, the state risks **antagonizing people**]{.mark} that the state
could be -- and needs to be -- bringing back into the fold as
citizens]{.underline}. Instead of encouraging defections from the ranks
of ISIS through tactics such as inducements or conditional amnesties for
low-to mid-level non-violent collaborators, [[current policies]{.mark}
risk [entrench]{.mark}ing support for violent **[extremism
through]{.mark} new [grievances]{.mark}** resulting from direct personal
arbitrary [and]{.mark} discriminatory
[mistreatment]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Justice for victims not
just punishment for perpetrators In many post-conflict situations,
effective strategies around how to deal with victims and perpetrators
often recognize that criminal justice and punishment is only one aspect
of achieving justice, and if used alone could cause **more harm than
good**]{.underline}. More [successful strategies have sought to harness
tools and approaches that encompass both punishing perpetrators and
addressing the **justice-based needs** of victims.]{.underline} In such
scenarios, it becomes imperative to not only prosecute those responsible
for the worst crimes, but to seek to address the other perpetrators,
including for lesser crimes, through other non-judicial means such as
vetting and removal from office, reforming abusive institutions,
disqualification from public office, disarmament and reintegration, etc.
At the same time, the needs of victims and survivors are equally
prioritized through programs providing remedies such as financial or
symbolic reparations, psychosocial support, health and education
benefits, information about missing or disappeared loved ones, and
releasing relatives from arbitrary detention or imprisonment[. [In
Iraq]{.mark} today, the approach of the [counterterrorism law]{.mark}
seems to favor **[cast]{.mark}ing [the net]{.mark} [widely]{.mark}** and
gathering everyone who is under suspicion---[rather than
prioritizing]{.mark} those most responsible for the most [heinous
crimes.]{.mark} The [people]{.mark} who get unjustly caught in this net
may be innocent individuals who chose not to flee and were forced to
live under ISIS rule, or those who committed petty crimes.]{.underline}
Suspicion extends to the families and children of those suspected of
having fought in the ranks of ISIS. [Many [languish in]{.mark}
internally displaced persons or ["isolation" camps]{.mark}, having been
displaced by the war or because their neighbors no longer want them
living among them. They may fall victim to **sexual abuse, forced
prostitution, or worse**.]{.underline} The battle over control of
territory may been won in Iraq, but [the war to defeat violent extremism
is there to lose. [If Iraq is going to]{.mark} effectively
[tackle]{.mark} the scourge of violent extremism and [ISIS, those in
authority need]{.mark} to review the current scorched earth
approach]{.underline}. [A good place to start would be to end the
stigmatization of those who have already suffered abuse under ISIS and
[to **replace the**]{.mark} **counterterrorism [law
]{.mark}**[with]{.mark} a **[more nuanced policy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### China Fill-In Inevitable

#### China-Iraq relations continue to grow

Richard **Weitz 12**, a Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for
Political-Military Analysis at Hudson Institute and an Expert at
Wikistrat, 6/25/12, "China-Iraq Ties: Oil, Arms, and Influence",
https://sldinfo.com/2012/06/china-iraq-ties-oil-arms-and-influence/

[[Sino-Iraq relations will]{.mark} likely continue to [strengthen in the
near future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark}, which imports more than half its oil, [needs Iraqi
energy]{.mark}, [while Iraq]{.mark}, which continues to suffer from
sectarian violence and an unstable political environment,
[depends]{.mark} heavily [on China's willingness to invest]{.mark} in
the country despite these lingering problems.]{.underline}

Yet, China's policy towards Iraq is often mischaracterized as being
determined exclusively by oil.

Unlike Iran and Saudi Arabia, Iraq has never been a major oil exporter
to China.

Indeed, Beijing's lukewarm opposition to the 2003 Anglo-American
invasion partly resulted from China's willingness to sacrifice Iraqi oil
opportunities for other benefits, such as the U.S. government's
declaration that the "East Turkestan Independence Movement (ETIM)" is a
terrorist organization and American assurances that the United States
would not attack North Korea's nuclear facilities.

Of course, China is not going to abstain from seeking opportunities to
access Iraq's oil or participate in other commercial ventures in the
country.

[**[Iraq's relationship with China has expanded significantly]{.mark}**
since 2003. [China has won stakes in 3]{.mark} out of the 11 [oil
contracts offered by the Iraqi government in addition to renegotiating
a]{.mark} Saddam-era [deal worth around \$3 billion]{.mark}. Chinese
firms have been willing to reestablish relations with Iraq shortly after
the U.S. invasion, and have since been willing to tolerate high levels
of risk in order to gain access to some of Iraq's most lucrative oil
contracts. These deals have collectively made China the biggest investor
in Iraq's oil and gas industry, which has the world's second largest
proven oil reserves.]{.underline}

### China Rise Peaceful

#### China's rise is [inevitable but it's peaceful]{.underline}\-\--there's [five principles]{.underline} to peaceful rise

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-15/chinas-peaceful-rise-south-china-sea-belt-and-road-huawei/11201526

[China has developed at an unprecedented rate]{.underline} since opening
up 40 years ago, [lifting]{.underline} some [850 million people out of
poverty]{.underline} [and becoming one of the largest contributors to
global economic growth]{.underline}. Key points: [[China\'s \"peaceful
rise\"]{.mark} policy [was]{.mark}]{.underline} initially [[introduced
to counter perceptions of]{.mark} a \"China
[threat]{.mark}\"]{.underline} Huawei and the South China Sea have
raised concerns about a \"peaceful\" rise Analysts say a [[power
shift]{.mark} from the US to China in the Asia-Pacific [is
\"inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}\" Beijing has long maintained its rise
will be \"peaceful\", yet its exceptional growth as an economic,
military and political power is commonly referred to as a \"threat\",
with experts calling its foreign policy \"aggressive\" and \"menacing\".
[In 2003, Chinese academic Zheng Bijian introduced [the policy
of]{.mark} **a \"[peaceful rise]{.mark}\"** under the leadership of
former president Hu Jintao, [to assert]{.mark} that **[China is not a
threat]{.mark}** to global peace and security, in line with its **[Five
Principles]{.mark} of Peaceful Coexistence**]{.underline}. The Five
Principles: [[Mutual **respect**]{.mark} **for**]{.underline} each
other\'s [**territorial integrity** and sovereignty Mutual
**[non-aggression]{.mark}** Mutual **[non-interference]{.mark}** in
others\' internal affairs **[Equality and coop]{.mark}eration** for
mutual benefit Peaceful co-existence]{.underline} Analysts also say [the
policies are China\'s attempt to avoid the Thucydides trap, which
predicts that a rising power will inevitably clash with an incumbent
dominant force, leading to war and conflict]{.underline}. However, the
policy was criticised almost as soon as it was introduced due to the
phrase \"rise\", which could sound threatening to the country\'s
neighbours. It was swiftly replaced with \"peaceful development\" in
official documents and speeches, but that hasn\'t swayed critics from
seeing the country as a threat. China\'s \'three warfares\' China\'s
\'three warfares\' While many superpowers seek to export their influence
overseas for self-interest, there lies a fundamental difference to the
motivations behind China\'s assertiveness. Belt and Road, Huawei and the
South China Sea Pradeep Taneja, an expert in Chinese politics at the
University of Melbourne, said Beijing\'s \"peaceful rise\" policy was
initially introduced to counter the \"China threat\" narrative. \"\[It\]
was meant to directly address concerns that China\'s economic and
military rise will ultimately lead to a conflict between the sole
surviving superpower, the United States, and China,\" Dr Taneja told the
ABC. Paul Monk, a former defence intelligence analyst, told the ABC that
Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s ascension to power was a turning point
in Beijing\'s foreign policy decisions. The trillion-dollar Belt and
Road Initiative has been accused as \"debt-trap diplomacy\", while the
US has warned that Chinese telecoms giant Huawei\'s 5G expansion posed a
\"national security risk\". A satellite reveals China\'s Cuarteron Reef
development in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, China\'s militarisation
of the islands in the South China Sea has become one of the main
potential flashpoints, analysts say. \"In practical terms, the use of
\[the peace narrative\] allows China to claim that it has no aggressive
intent, while at the same time aggressively pursuing its strategic
interests, especially in the South China Sea,\" Dr Taneja said. [The
narrative of China\'s peaceful nature and growth has been used by many
of its leaders to argue that **its rise will be different** to other
great powers of the past.]{.underline} China\'s economic resilience
became evident after it rode through the 2008 global financial crisis
relatively unscathed, and with time it became more willing to assert
itself, especially under President Xi, according to Dr Monk. While
analysts recognise that it has been a long-term strategy for the Chinese
Communist Party and the People\'s Liberation Army to counter the US in
East Asia and the Asia-Pacific, Dr Monk says **[such [a shift is
inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China\'s contingency plans and
\'American assertiveness\' Soldiers of China\'s People\'s Liberation
Army get ready for the military parade. Andrew J Nathan, professor of
Chinese politics at Columbia University, writes that [[the]{.mark} Five
[Principles]{.mark} of Peaceful Coexistence [offer an alternative
to]{.mark} the [US-led world order]{.mark}, where international
institutions often reflect US interests and values. This [Chinese
alternative would **allow nations to govern**]{.mark} their own
political systems and people [as they see fit]{.mark}, and stresses that
all nations are equal to do so without interference]{.underline}. For
example, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
[[China has]{.mark} commonly [**vetoed or abstained** from]{.mark}
voting on [resolutions that require intervention]{.mark} or
sanctions]{.underline}. Chinese President Xi Jinping, dressed in
camouflage gear, stands atop a military car during a parade. Jane
Golley, China expert at the Australian National University, told the ABC
[it is \"natural and expected\" for an emerging superpower like China to
create plans to protect its own interests]{.underline}. Dr Golley said
[the militarisation of the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea \"[does not inherently contradict a peaceful
development\",]{.underline} explaining that [it is a security measure to
ensure shipping lanes would be open in the event of war]{.underline}.
\"The costs of war would take away from China\'s economic gains,\" she
said. \"[What [China is pursuing]{.mark} is [economic power]{.mark}, and
investment and economics [is **inherently
peaceful**]{.mark}.]{.underline}\" Dr Golley added that \"American
assertiveness\" has led China --- under President Xi --- to build up its
military \"in line with its economic power\". [\"Why wouldn\'t a rising
power prepare a contingency in the event of a conflict with a
superpower?\"]{.underline} However, while China pursues a peaceful
foreign policy unless provoked, domestically it is a different story,
she said. \"Beijing is enacting policies which are certainly worrying,\"
Dr Golley told the ABC. \"You see it in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and within
its own borders, but I\'m yet to see comprehensive evidence of
aggression overseas.\" Are we sleepwalking into WWIII? A former Defence
Force chief says in our lifetimes, our economy will be devastated, our
land seized, our system of government upended. Dr Monk emphasised [it is
important to **keep a \"cool head\"** about comparing China\'s rise to
its great power predecessors]{.underline}. He said the world\'s former
superpowers --- including Europe\'s colonial powers and Japan --- have
previously risen through \"an unprecedented catastrophe\". These include
world wars or the mass enslavement of peoples. \"[[The possibility
of]{.mark} \[similar [conflict]{.mark}\] occurring in the 21st century
[as a result of China\'s rise is
**non-existent**]{.mark},\"]{.underline} Dr Monk told the ABC.
\"\[China\] has become integrated as a late starter in a mature
international system of trade and investment, and if it messes that
system up it would suffer egregiously.\"

### Russia Fill-In Inevitable

#### Russia has already sold weapons to Iraq

expert for The Jamestown Foundation and a non-resident fellow at the
Central Asia-Caucasus Institute in Washington DC, 3/21/18, "Russia
Reemerging as Weapons Supplier to Iraq",
https://jamestown.org/program/russia-reemerging-weapons-supplier-iraq/

One of the most notable political developments of the past several years
has been the gradual reemergence of Russia as a rising regional military
and diplomatic power in the Middle East, renewing connections that were
adversely affected by the 1991 collapse the Soviet Union. Beyond Syria[,
[Russia is re-engaging with Iraq.]{.mark} On March 12, Russian President
Vladimir Putin's aide for military-technical cooperation, Vladimir
Kozhin, stated that **[Russia would renew]{.mark} [armaments shipments
to Iraq]{.mark}**, telling reporters, "Iraq is our traditional partner,
and it is boosting its potential by ordering our equipment. Currently we
are equipping an entire armored brigade there. [Deliveries of]{.mark}
our armored [equipment are under way, which will significantly increase
the country's defense potential]{.mark}" (RIA Novosti, March
12).]{.underline}

During the reign of Saddam Hussein, first the Soviet Union and then the
Russian Federation was Iraq's largest weapons supplier. The total value
of the contracts for the supply of Soviet weapons in 1958--1990 was
\$30.5 billion at current prices, for which, before the invasion of
Kuwait, Iraq managed to pay \$22.4 billion (Voennoe Obozrenie, July 5,
2015). Unlike many of Moscow's client states that received massive
amounts of Soviet weaponry either for free or for loans that were never
repaid, Iraq paid for its armaments both with hard currency and oil that
was easily sold for cash.

After the United States--led military operation overthrew Hussein in
2003, the new government in Baghdad shifted its arms procurement to US
weaponry. The Iraqi army currently deploys M1 Abrams main battle tanks,
built by General Dynamics.

[On February 20, 2018, the Iraqi chief of the General Staff, Osman
Ganimi, said that Iraq's Ministry of Defense had received the first
batch of 36 contracted T-90S tanks, with another 37 tanks scheduled for
delivery by late April. The aim of the deal with Russia, Ganimi
declared, was "increasing the combat capacity of armored troops" (TASS,
March 12).]{.underline}

[In 2012, in the aftermath of several visits to Russia by an Iraqi
delegation headed by the former minister of defense, Saadun Dulaimi, and
a subsequent meeting of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev with his
counterpart, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, several contracts were
signed for the **delivery of weapons** and military equipment to Iraq
**worth roughly \$4.2 billion**.]{.underline} Iraq's purchases included
48 Pantsir-C1 anti-aircraft missile systems and up to 40 Mi-28NE attack
helicopters, with the first helicopters under the contract arriving in
2014 (Lenta, July 30, 2014).

Above and beyond Iraq's purchase of 36 Russian T-90 tanks, discussions
for further Iraqi purchases of Russian weaponry are underway. On
February 27, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari said that Baghdad
was also discussing acquiring the Russian S-400 Triumph anti-aircraft
missile system to enhance his country's defensive capabilities. He
noted, "At the moment, this issue is being studied in the most careful
way" (Kommersant, February 27). Al-Jafari added that [[Iraq had suffered
losses in confronting Islamic State jihadists and]{.mark}, consequently,
**[was determined to]{.mark}** take decisive measures to rebuild and
**[increase its defensive capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Biznes
Rossii, February 28).

#### Congress reducing arms sales builds bipartisan consensus

Elias **Yousif 19**, arms trade and security researcher with the Center
for International Policy\'s Security Assistance Monitor, 7/9/19
"Congress needs more authority in international arms sales"
<https://thehill.com/opinion/international/452290-congress-needs-more-authority-in-international-arms-sales>

Like no other time in recent memory, [[Congress]{.mark} is
[losing]{.mark} the war for its [rightful place in American
governance.]{.mark}]{.underline} [President
Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump)'s distaste for the norms
that have traditionally limited the authority of his office have
battered the separation of powers, a founding principle of American
political life and an essential bulwark against presidential overreach[.
And when it comes to the weighty decision to transfer American weapons
beyond our shores, our president has shown that the balance of power
between the executive and legislative branches has come to list
dangerously to one side]{.underline}.

Indeed, the president's unflinching and unrestrained determination
to [send armaments to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-arms/republicans-in-congress-push-back-on-trump-weapons-packages-to-saudi-arabia-uae-idUSKCN1TD2JX) ---
over the objections of lawmakers, civil society and the public at large
--- illustrates perfectly that, in the battle for the weapons of war,
Congress has stumbled into its Waterloo. If nothing else, the
president's recent efforts reflect just how much of Congress' historical
oversight of U.S. arms sales has been based on norms rather than laws,
and on policy rather than on statute. 

In May, Trump, laying bare just how feeble Congress' grip on the arms
sales process really is, [declared an
"emergency](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/politics/trump-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-uae/index.html)"
that bypassed the legally required congressional review process and
expedited the transfer of weapons to Abu Dhabi and Riyadh that will
likely [find their way to the frontlines of Yemen's civil
war](https://www.justsecurity.org/64413/an-emergency-arms-deal-will-congress-acquiesce-in-another-blow-to-its-authority/).  

Though the invocation of the president's emergency authority was a
flagrant breach of traditional norms, it offers a revealing insight: [We
have endowed Congress with insufficient statutory authority to play a
meaningful role in overseeing and scrutinizing the arms sales
process.]{.underline}

Under the [Arms Export Control Act
(AECA)](https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Arms%20Export%20Control%20Act.pdf),
the principal piece of legislation governing the U.S. arms trade,
Congress is enshrined as an important arbiter in the arms sales process.
[While the [executive branch develops arms sales proposals]{.mark}, [it
is through Congress that the public gets its so sole input into the
process.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Congress is where elected officials, representing the American people,
can voice their concerns.  Unfortunately, the structure of the law
effectively ensures that, when the administration wants to push guns,
bombs and other weapons systems to far-flung parts of the world, there
is little lawmakers can do to stop them.

Under the law, [Congress must receive a 30-day formal
notification](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL31675.pdf) before a sale
can proceed, giving them an opportunity to block the sale through a
joint resolution of disapproval, requiring a majority in both bodies of
Congress to take effect. As if passage of bicameral legislation was not
enough of a barrier, the bill can then be vetoed by the president who,
presumably, supports his or her own proposed arms sale.  Congress must
then muster a two-thirds majority in both houses to override the
president, something that has occurred in [fewer than 10 percent of all
presidential
vetoes](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/override_of_a_veto.htm) and
has [never
successfully](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/30/yes-trump-can-override-congress-sell-weapons-saudi-arabia-even-over-republican-objections/?utm_term=.f800a79cf55e) been
done with respect to arms sales.

Under previous administrations, [an informal negotiation
process](https://www.lawfareblog.com/untangling-yemen-arms-sales-debate) between
Congress and the White House moderated the overwhelming statutory power
of the executive branch. The normative system ensured that sales were
only introduced once a consensus had formed that lawmakers would approve
them. Congressional concerns were addressed before the formal
notification and accounted for within the administration's
deliberations. Though imperfect, the practice acted as a check on an
administration's sales authority and theoretically gave Congress the
power to indefinitely prevent certification.

But because this was an informal system, predicated on executive
deference to its co-equal branch of government, we should not be
surprised that Trump has shown little patience for it. Instead, we are
forced now to rely on the letter of the law --- which all but ensures
that this administration, and any subsequent one, can sell arms when and
to whom it wants without respect to the wishes of Congress or the
public.  That has to change.

The humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where precision munitions provided by
the United States [have killed scores of
civilians](https://theintercept.com/2018/05/11/american-saudi-arabia-weapons-deal-yemen-uae/),
is just the latest theater of war where American armaments are
contributing to abuses of human rights and international humanitarian
law, and it is unlikely to be the last. 

Congress was granted a role in the arms sales process for good reason.
Public scrutiny of arms sales is an indispensable insurance policy
against irresponsible transactions that, for the sake of momentary
expedience, risk ethical, moral and strategic compromises.  For the
American people, it is our sole window into an otherwise opaque world.
We can't allow it to be closed. 

Lawmakers who are now working to retroactively block arms sales to Saudi
Arabia and the UAE should consider adding caveats to the president's
emergency authority. The [Saudi Arabia False Emergencies (SAFE)
Act](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/saudi-arabia-false-emergencies-act-approved-by-senate-foreign-relations-committee),
recently taken up by the Senate, is a good start, and a promising
opening salvo for their recuperation of authority over arms transfer
decision-making. 

More importantly, the bipartisan frustration with the president's
insistence on sending weapons over the heads of lawmakers should
catalyze a serious conversation on how the sales process is vetted under
the watchful gaze of the public eye, and just how much power should be
vested in the executive branch. 

Wednesday's Senate Foreign Relations
Committee [hearing](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/hearings/defense-cooperation-use-of-emergency-authorities-under-the-arms-export-control-act) on
the president's emergency declaration that expedited arms shipments to
the Gulf should serve as the new frontline in Congress's tug of war with
the White House[. [Lawmakers]{.mark} [should]{.mark} not only demand
answers on this specific episode, but also [draw a line in the sand for
their own authority in the broader arms sales
process.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

Ultimately, in an era of partisanship, [[enshrining a more direct role
for lawmakers in the arms sales process is a good opportunity for
**bipartisan** **consensus**]{.underline}]{.mark}. With a president who
has shown norms to be insufficient a check on executive power, [it is
high time that [lawmakers]{.mark} make a final [stand for their role as
arbiters of the exports that enable warfare and conflict across the
globe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[USA's]{.underline} [arms transfers to Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}
and Iraq

Between 2013 and 2016, [the USA]{.underline} has [exported arms
[worth]{.mark} of [\$379]{.mark} [million]{.mark}]{.underline} (Trend
Indicator Values, TIV) [to Afghanistan]{.underline}\[9\] and worth
\$2,225 million (TIV) to Iraq.\[10\] In 2016, Action on Armed Violence
([[AOAV]{.underline}]{.mark}) [published an analysis]{.underline}
covering the period between September 2001 and September 2015
[[showing]{.underline}]{.mark}, among other things, that [[the]{.mark}
US [D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense]{.underline} (DoD)
"actually [[spent]{.underline}]{.mark} a possible total of
\$[2,158,253,826 on small arms]{.underline} including ammunition and
attachments [to Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline} --
[[over]{.underline}]{.mark} \$2 billion and almost [[eight times]{.mark}
[than]{.mark} publicly [stated]{.mark}]{.underline} by the DoD
(\$1,176,671,415 for Iraq; \$981,582,411 for Afghanistan)" during that
period.\[11\] [[AOAV]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[highlighted]{.mark}
"the [lack of accountability]{.mark}, [transparency]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} joined up [[data]{.mark} that exists
[at]{.mark} the very heart of [the US government's weapon]{.mark}
procurement and [distribution]{.mark} systems."\[]{.underline}12\]

In 2016, [[the UN]{.underline}]{.mark} Secretary-General
[[reported]{.mark} that in Afghanistan]{.underline} the number of
verified cases of [[recruitment]{.mark} and use [of children more than
doubled]{.mark} compared [with]{.mark} [2014]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
verified [recruitment]{.underline} cases were [[attributed]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and the
majority to [the Taliban]{.mark} and other armed groups]{.underline}.
The Secretary-General also reported "continuing [[concern]{.mark}
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} allegations of [**[cross-border
recruitment]{.mark}** of children]{.underline} and of use of religious
schools [in Afghanistan and Pakistan [for child]{.mark}]{.underline}
recruitment and [[military]{.underline}]{.mark} training [by the

International\[14\] and Human Rights Watch\[15\] are among the NGOs that
have reported child recruitment in Afghanistan.

In late 2016, [Human Rights Watch documented 29 cases]{.underline} in

with **[[cases]{.underline}]{.mark}** attributed to
**[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Kurdish Workers Party and other
Kurdish armed groups, and to groups under the umbrella of the popular

Conclusion and recommendations

As noted earlier, **[[arms transfers]{.mark} facilitate violence that
[enables]{.mark} the conditions for [recruitment of child
soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The fact that recruitment and [use of
[children]{.mark} in hostilities]{.underline} is a recognized problem in
a country [[should]{.mark} [be a]{.mark} cause for [concern in making
arms export decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [per any human rights
assessment]{.underline}. Such assessment should not be limited to
determining whether arms transfers from [[the US]{.mark}A]{.underline}
are a direct factor in making it easier to recruit children or whether
are used by child soldiers.

The Committee [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} reiterate its
recommendations to the USA [with regard to arms transfers]{.underline},
in particular the recommendation to enact and [[apply full
**prohibition** of arms]{.mark} exports]{.underline}, including small
arms and light weapons, as well as any kind of military assistance [[to
countries where children are **known**]{.mark} **to be, [or may

#### Link turn\-\--using the police for military functions causes more Afghanistan instability

Kelsey **Smith 17**, Associate Editor of the Observer Contributor
Network, 11/21/17, "Law and Order in Afghanistan---or Lack Thereof,"
https://observer.com/2017/11/afghan-national-police-focus-on-combatting-taliban-over-rule-of-law/

Forming a professionalized constabulary, though a stated long-term goal,
took a distant backseat to the desperate need to stave off battlefield
reverses. Though its efforts are admirable[, the U.S. military is simply
not trained to build and manage a police force]{.underline}. SIGAR's
John Spoko noted the Pentagon is so tragically ill-equipped that some
U.S. military members watch Cops and NCIS to try to figure out what to
teach the ANP.

This shift in mission for the ANP to become, as Felbab-Brown put it, a
"light counterinsurgency force" was so controversial that the Europeans,
who were involved for well over a decade, ceased their contributions to
the mission on December 31, 2016, citing that the [[Afghan police
were]{.mark} "[increasingly focus\[ed\] on fighting]{.mark} insurgents
[rather than traditional police work]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Head of EUPOL Afghanistan Pia Stjernvall said of the situation,
"[[When]{.underline} [70 percent of policemen are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[still [fighting the war, it's]{.mark} quite [impossible for them to
concentrate on]{.mark} doing [policing]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The consequences of the police focusing on counterinsurgency are dire
and have produced an environment ripe for Taliban exploitation. "[[ANP
being focused on countering the Taliban]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
ultimately [a [short-term]{.mark} and problematic decision [because it
doesn't address a core function of the state, providing security from
crime]{.mark}]{.underline}," Felbab-Brown told Observer. "It allows the
Taliban to outperform the government in delivering this crucial
service."

The Taliban's threat is two-fold and pernicious. In districts that are
contested or under its control, the Taliban provides the essential state
function of security. [The group's initial takeover of the country in
the mid-1990s was partly propelled by its ability to bring law and
order, however harsh, to Afghanistan's lawless regions.]{.underline}

Yet [[in areas under Afghan government control]{.underline}]{.mark},
[the [Taliban]{.mark} does the opposite: It [takes advantage of the
ANP's weakness at policing by committing rampant
crimes.]{.mark}]{.underline} Sometimes the Taliban functions more as a
criminal syndicate than an insurgency, and in addition to robberies,
theft and murder, kidnappings for ransom are also on the rise. The Asia
Foundation reports that in 2017, 71 percent of Afghans said they feared
for their safety sometimes, often or always---a 31 percent increase
since the survey began in 2006. Whether an area is under Afghan
government control or not, the **[[ANP's status as a paramilitary force
focused on counterinsurgency]{.mark} rather than policing [empowers the
Taliban.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The [[ANP's function as]{.mark} a [vital "hold" force is]{.mark} also
[showing signs of distres]{.mark}s]{.underline}. [As of October 2017,
the Afghan government controlled only 57 percent of
Afghanistan,]{.underline} a number that has steadily declined over the
last two years. Meanwhile, according to the United Nations, [armed
clashes in Afghanistan are at an all-time high.]{.underline} **[[The
police "are]{.mark} hugely [vulnerable and often not capable of
performing the task]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Felbab-Brown said.

And it's not just the police that were nonexistent when Americans
arrived on the scene in 2001---the entire justice system needed a
complete overhaul. [[Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior,]{.mark} which
has jurisdiction over the ANP, [was corrupt from top to bottom, even by
local standards]{.mark}]{.underline}. As recently as this year, [Afghan
President Ashraf Ghani called the MOI the most corrupt institution in
the country]{.underline}.

In addition to ANP and MOI corruption[, judges tasked with sentencing
those found guilty were mostly able to be bought off. Prosecutors and
judges often relied on confessions instead of evidence]{.underline},
thereby engraining torture as a legitimate element of the Afghan legal
process, according to General Allen, who sought to reform the entire
system. Most detention centers were so out of control that they were de
facto run by the prisoners sent there to serve their sentences.

As General Allen told Observer, "The enormity of what we sought to do,
while we kept the Taliban at bay using U.S. and NATO military forces,
plus building an army that could do it for the Afghans... The enormity
of what we needed to do to build the law enforcement piece of this was
really significant."

[Though maintaining order is vital]{.underline} to even the most basic
of societies, not to mention a cornerstone of any effective
counterinsurgency, [[Afghanistan's force]{.mark} [tasked with
asserting]{.mark} the rule of [law is unable to do
so]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the ANP's shortcomings aid the very
insurgents trying to topple the government. Fighting on the front lines,
not policing, remains the primary mission of the ANP, a predicament that
seems impossible to repair at present. And as long as basic security for
the population is inadequate, the Afghan government will not be able to
stand on its own and the U.S. will likely remain engaged in that
troubled country militarily.

[Approaching the two-decade mark, much progress has been achieved in
transforming Afghanistan into a law-based state, but much more is
needed]{.underline}. Though the Obama administration was intent on
achieving full withdrawal of U.S. troops, the [Trump administration
appears prepared to commit the resources necessary]{.underline} for
victory---or at least to forestall strategic defeat. And in this case,
victory is not just defeating the Taliban; it's providing Afghanistan
the wherewithal to defeat the insurgency on its own long after foreign
troop withdrawal, a daunting task.

Transforming an entire society and its security sector is a generational
undertaking and has at times seemed out of reach to Americans eager for
their troops' return. But with an active insurgency that won't stay
defeated---the very insurgency that Americans have been trying to wipe
out since October 2001---the U.S. remains steadfast in its commitment to
Afghanistan until the Taliban is administered its final blow.

America's longest war has been a complicated endeavor and ultimate
victory over the Taliban remains uncertain, but asked if he is
optimistic that the U.S. will achieve its goal of building a viable
security force in Afghanistan, General Allen---the man once tasked with
doing so---said, "If our goal is an end state, which would be a
measurable means for success, as opposed to an end date, then I think we
can do it. I think we can do it."

### 1AR -- Link Turn -- Arms Sales

#### Arms sales to Afghanistan fuel the Taliban

Austin **Bodetti 17**, Mizna Fellowship recipient for research in South
Asia, 3-8-2017, \"How the US Is Indirectly Arming the Taliban,\" The
Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/how-the-us-is-indirectly-arming-the-taliban/

The last five years suggest that President Obama too easily gives these
governments a pass. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act gives him a
powerful tool to let U.S. military aid recipients know that the use of
child soldiers is unacceptable. He should use it.

While empowering [[allied militaries]{.underline}]{.mark} to confront
insurgents on their own has become the cornerstone of the American
approach to counterterrorism, that strategy comes with a drawback: those
militaries [[often lose]{.underline}]{.mark} Western-supplied
[[equipment to]{.underline}]{.mark} American-labeled [[terrorist
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In 2014, the Islamic State captured weapons from Syrian rebels armed by
the United States. In 2015, the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataib
Hezbollah acquired several M1 Abrams tanks sold to the Iraqi Security
Forces by the U.S. This problem has spread as far as Afghanistan, where
much of the Taliban's armory comes from American equipment given to the
Afghan military and police.

[The insurgents' Western-sourced arsenal]{.underline} includes lasers
and night-vision goggles abandoned by Afghan and American soldiers and
[bought on the black market]{.underline}, [doubling the number of
nighttime Taliban attacks and tripling the rate of Afghan
casualties]{.underline} between 2014 and 2017.

In 2015, the insurgents posted videos of themselves driving Humvees and
tanks during the Battle of Kunduz, and, in 2016, they used Humvees to
conduct suicide attacks on an Afghan checkpoint in the southern province
of Helmand. Last year, the Taliban distributed propaganda purported to
depict American assault rifles and radios captured in an operation in
Kandahar.

As early as December 2013, well before the extent of the problem had
become apparent, the Taliban bragged about taking an American military
dog as a prisoner of war.

These developments present a Catch-22 for the United States. On the one
hand, the Afghan National Army and Police often depend on their
technological superiority over the insurgents; Washington risks
jeopardizing that advantage by limiting or withholding equipment from
security forces already struggling on the battlefield. On the other, any
equipment that the United States provides its Afghan allies may find its
way to the Taliban, which will deploy it against Afghan soldiers and
their American advisers.

"[[The Taliban gets its hands on]{.underline}]{.mark} most of the
[[equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly vehicles, [[through
raids]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} quite a
few [[reports of the Afghan military selling
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and editor of The Long War
Journal. "The insurgents use this equipment tactically --- to
impersonate Afghan and Western soldiers. Considering how often they're
deploying it, they must have figured out a way to maintain the vehicles
and weapons too."

Other insurgents in Afghanistan have adopted similar tactics. Late last
month, the Islamic State launched an assault on the Afghan interior
ministry in Kabul by driving to its headquarters in vehicles stolen from
Resolute Support Mission, the American-led coalition in Afghanistan.

Update: Resolute Support Public Affairs later clarified that initial
reports on the vehicles used in the attack were incorrect: "Initial
reports were that the vehicles were HMMVs \[Humvees\], however these
vehicles were regular SUVs and not stolen from Resolute Support."

Unlike the Taliban, which appears to obtain most of its Western-made
equipment from Afghan soldiers on the battlefield or the black market,
[[the Islamic State has]{.underline} [gone as far as taking
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} right [[off American
commandos]{.underline}]{.mark}. American special operations forces lost
a machine gun and a rocket launcher to the insurgents in a 2016
firefight in the eastern province of Nangarhar.

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has struggled to monitor what happens to]{.underline}]{.mark} American
[[equipment]{.mark} once it enters the possession of Afghan]{.underline}
policemen and [soldiers]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the Islamic State and
the Taliban's proficiency at capturing and deploying it grows by the
day. The Defense and State Departments oversee the sale of American
weapons to allied militaries, but Afghanistan presents them unique
challenges.

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul referred questions to the Bureau of South and
Central Asian Affairs, the State Department subagency in charge of
Afghanistan and neighboring countries.

"The loss of equipment is a concern of the U.S. Government, including
the State Department and the Department of Defense," said a State
Department spokesperson. "The Department is aware that battlefield loss
of equipment can occur during military operations." She referred further
questions to the Defense Department, whose inspector general sometimes
documents those losses.

The Defense Department fulfills that task in Afghanistan through the
Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction or SIGAR, which
evaluates the efficiency of how the Defense Department, the State
Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development spend
funds appropriated by Congress to complete their mandates in the
country.

A SIGAR spokesperson told The Diplomat that the watchdog had received no
information on how much American-supplied equipment Afghan security
forces had lost to insurgents or details on how the security forces had
lost it. She referred further inquiries to Resolute Support.

"While the Resolute Support mission includes training, advising, and
assisting both the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior on
military readiness and logistics, there is no mechanism in place to
track American-supplied equipment and weaponry that the Afghan military
and police lose to the Taliban," admitted a Resolute Support
spokesperson, who referred questions on whether the Afghan defense and
interior ministries monitored the problem to those government agencies.

The Afghanistan National Security Council, an interagency task force
that includes the Defense and Interior Ministries, failed to respond to
repeated requests for comment.

"All recipient countries, including Afghanistan, sign agreements with
the United States Government to protect and control U.S.-supplied items
in the same manner the United States Government does," the Resolute
Support spokesperson told The Diplomat. "For example, small arms are
secured per this agreement under three levels of protection --- weapons
are held in locker containers inside locked buildings on military
installations with around-the-clock armed guards."

Though the level of security enforced by American soldiers and their
Afghan counterparts often proves effective, it remains far from
foolproof. Last year, the Taliban executed a suicide attack inside
Bagram Airfield, one of the most important American military bases in
Afghanistan. The insurgents have also demonstrated their ability to
infiltrate the Afghan Army and Police many times before.

"However, in the event that Afghan military equipment is stolen, the
Afghan National Defense and Security Forces work quickly to reacquire
the equipment or eliminate it from the battlefield altogether so as not
to allow the enemy an advantage," said the Resolute Support
spokesperson. "For example, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan aircraft have
assisted the Afghans by removing approximately 40 Taliban-stolen Humvees
from the battlefield since 1 Jan 2015 via airstrikes."

USA Today reported the destruction of the Humvees on June 6. The United
States had to employ a similar maneuver when it damaged an aircraft in
Yemen during an ill-fated raid last year.

This strategy only addresses the symptoms of a wider problem: systemic
corruption, which enables Afghan insurgents to buy American-supplied
equipment from their theoretical military opponents. Though difficult to
document, the phenomenon has likely existed since at least 2009.

"We cannot speak to the Taliban means of supply," said the Resolute
Support spokesperson.

For their part, the insurgents had an answer.

"We receive American weapons through many methods and also seize them
from government soldiers in Kabul," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid
told The Diplomat. "Also, we receive them from personal links, and we
don't want give more details about it."

As long as the United States continues to arm the Afghan Army and Police
and unless it implements more effective failsafes, American policymakers
will likely have to accept the possibility that many of those weapons
will find their way to the Islamic State and the Taliban.

"If, as it seems, [[American]{.mark} taxpayers [are indirectly arming
the Taliban]{.mark} this way]{.underline}," reflected Roggio, "the U.S.
needs to reevaluate its strategy in Afghanistan --- which has long been
apparent."

#### US is weapons trickle down to the Taliban -- corruption and loses, new proposals don't solve 

Shawn **Snow**, 7-25-20**17**, \"US weapons complicate Afghan war,\"

WASHINGTON --- [[Weaponry provided to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Afghan
militar]{.mark}y]{.underline} over the last 16 years has slowly
[[trickled down to the Taliban through corruption and battlefield
losses]{.underline}.]{.mark} Armored vehicles, night vision devices,
M-4s, laser illuminators and scoped optics have all found the way into
Taliban hands over the years. And at times the [[U.S. has been forced to
combat its own armored vehicles and weapons.]{.underline}]{.mark} For
instance, captured U.S. up-armored Humvees are being used as suicide
vehicle borne improvised explosive devices, or SVBIEDs. This tactic has
also been a favorite of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Mosul, causing
coalition forces to supply anti-tank weaponry to defeat the heavily
armored mobile bombs. According to Maj. Kendra Motz--- the spokeswoman
for the 300-person Task Force Southwest --- the Marine unit has launched
"strikes" to destroy stolen Humvees, to prevent the resurgent Taliban
threat from using them as SVBIEDs. "There are reports of Taliban with
some night-vision capabilities," Motz told Military Times. A senior
Afghan defense official also confirmed that some [Taliban fighters have
night vision capabilities]{.underline}. Pictures of a few Taliban with
older generation AN/PVS 7b night vision have also appeared on Taliban
propaganda videos posted to the group's official website. The U.S. has
spent billions in military aid to the Afghan military over the last 16
years. This year's request through the Afghan Security Forces Fund
stands at nearly \$5 billion, an increase of nearly \$800 million from
last year and almost \$1.5 billion more than FY2016. This year the
Afghan air force will field new UH-60 Black Hawks to replace aging
Russian Mi-17s, and new cell phone exploitation kits to boost
intelligence collection capabilities. The 2018 request for funds also
includes upgrades and replacements to sophisticated rifle optics and
night vision equipment, such as 4x magnification ACOG scopes and
infrared lasers. "The \[Afghan Special Security Forces\] require the
ability to upgrade, procure and replace battle damaged night fire
equipment, infrared illuminators, range finders and other equipment sets
that support Special Forces operations during limited visibility
conditions," the budget request reads."I never experienced the
\[Taliban\] having a large number of their fighters with this more
advanced equipment, it was always just a couple here and there," said
Adam Routh, a former Army Ranger and defense strategies expert at the
Center for a New American Security --- a think tank located in
Washington, D.C. "It would also surprise me if a large number of
\[Taliban\], in the same area, had complete sets of advanced equipment,"
Routh added. In areas of Uruzgan province, the Afghan National Army, or
ANA, is afraid to conduct night operations, impacting its ability to
hold re-captured terrain, a U.S. military official told Military Times.
[[Large numbers of Taliban fighters]{.underline}]{.mark} in the area
[[have night vision,]{.underline}]{.mark} ACOGs, and M-4s, and they are
fighting an ANA force supplied with only M-16s, helmets and flak
jackets, the official said. In one instance, an ANA night patrol in
[[the region experienced]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly 20 [[casualties
because the opponent was better equipped]{.mark},]{.underline} the
official said. [[Corruption also plays a prominent role.]{.mark}
I]{.underline}n Uruzgan for instance, ANA soldiers have sold ammunition
to locals in the villages, including Taliban commanders, to bridge the
gap of wage theft committed by commanding officers, the official
explained. Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, pushed a plan before lawmakers in February with a focus on
rebuilding and boosting the offensive capabilities of the Afghan special
forces units to break the "stalemate." However, much of the problem is
the ability of conventional Afghan troops to hold terrain re-captured by
Afghan commando offensive operations. The White House is still
considering a proposal to increase troops in America's longest war by
nearly 4,000. The budget proposal submitted by the Defense Department
seeks to revitalize Afghan forces battlefield edge while boosting
offensive capabilities. But [[neither proposal addresses corruption and
low morale among Afghan army troops.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### US arms arming the Taliban terrorists -- raids and theft 

Austin **Bodetti,** The Diplomat, 3-8-20**17**, \"How the US Is
Indirectly Arming the Taliban,\" Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/how-the-us-is-indirectly-arming-the-taliban/

In 2015, the insurgents posted videos of themselves driving Humvees and
tanks during the Battle of Kunduz, and, in 2016, they
[used](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/world/asia/taliban-humvee-attack-afghanistan.html)
Humvees to conduct suicide attacks on an Afghan checkpoint in the
southern province of Helmand. Last year, the Taliban distributed
propaganda purported to depict American assault rifles and radios
[captured](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/08/14/taliban-propaganda-showcases-us-weapons-and-radios-as-captured-war-spoils/)
in an operation in Kandahar. As early as December 2013, well before the
extent of the problem had become apparent, the Taliban bragged about
[taking](http://www.military.com/video/operations-and-strategy/afghanistan-conflict/taliban-claims-to-capture-military-dog/3162004694001)
an American military dog as a prisoner of war. These developments
present a Catch-22 for the United States. On the one hand, the Afghan
National Army and Police often depend on their technological superiority
over the insurgents; Washington risks jeopardizing that advantage by
limiting or withholding equipment from security forces already
struggling on the battlefield. On the other, any equipment that the
United States provides its Afghan allies may find its way to the
Taliban, which will deploy it against Afghan soldiers and their American
advisers. ["The [Taliban gets]{.mark} its hands on most of the
[equipment]{.mark}, particularly [vehicles]{.mark}, [through
raids,]{.mark} [but there are]{.mark} quite a few r[eports of the Afghan
military selling weapons,]{.mark}"]{.underline} said Bill Roggio, a
senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and
editor of The Long War Journal. "The insurgents use this equipment
tactically --- to impersonate Afghan and Western soldiers. Considering
how often they're deploying it, they must have figured out a way to
maintain the vehicles and weapons too." Other insurgents in Afghanistan
have adopted similar tactics. Late last month, the Islamic State
[launched](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/world/asia/afghanistan-interior-ministry-attack.html)
an assault on the Afghan interior ministry in Kabul by driving to its
headquarters in vehicles stolen from Resolute Support Mission, the
American-led coalition in Afghanistan. Update: Resolute Support Public
Affairs later clarified that initial reports on the vehicles used in the
attack were incorrect: "Initial reports were that the vehicles were
HMMVs \[Humvees\], however these vehicles were regular SUVs and not
stolen from Resolute Support." Unlike the
[[Taliban]{.underline},]{.mark} which [appears to [obtain most of
its]{.mark} Western-made [equipment from Afghan soldiers on the
battlefield or the black market,]{.mark} the Islamic State [has gone as
far as taking weapons right off American commandos.]{.mark} American
special operations forces
[lost](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/isis-claims-it-has-captured-us-weapons-ammunition-and-soldier-id-cards-in-afghanistan-a7179136.html)
a machine gun and a rocket launcher to the insurgents in a 2016
firefight in the eastern province of Nangarhar.]{.underline} [[The
United States has struggled to monitor what happens to American
equipment once it enters the possession of Afghan policemen and
soldiers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Meanwhile, the Islamic State and the
**[[Taliban's proficiency at capturing and deploying it grows by the
day]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Defense and State Departments oversee
the sale of American weapons to allied militaries, but Afghanistan
presents them unique challenges. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul referred
questions to the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, the State
Department subagency in charge of Afghanistan and neighboring countries.
"The loss of equipment is a concern of the U.S. Government, including
the State Department and the Department of Defense," said a State
Department spokesperson. "The Department is aware that battlefield loss
of equipment can occur during military operations." She referred further
questions to the Defense Department, whose inspector general sometimes
documents those losses. The Defense Department fulfills that task in
Afghanistan through the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction or SIGAR, which evaluates the efficiency of how the
Defense Department, the State Department, and the U.S. Agency for
International Development spend funds appropriated by Congress to
complete their mandates in the country. A SIGAR spokesperson told The
Diplomat that the watchdog had received no information on how much
American-supplied equipment Afghan security forces had lost to
insurgents or details on how the security forces had lost it. She
referred further inquiries to Resolute Support. "While the Resolute
Support mission includes training, advising, and assisting both the
Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior on military readiness and
logistics, there is no mechanism in place to track American-supplied
equipment and weaponry that the Afghan military and police lose to the
Taliban," admitted a Resolute Support spokesperson, who referred
questions on whether the Afghan defense and interior ministries
monitored the problem to those government agencies. The Afghanistan
National Security Council, an interagency task force that includes the
Defense and Interior Ministries, failed to respond to repeated requests
for comment. ["All recipient countries, including Afghanistan, sign
agreements with the United States Government to protect and control
U.S.-supplied items in the same manner the United States Government

#### US is the largest arm supplier for Afghanistan

Thomas C. **Frohlich**, 3-26-20**19**, \"Saudi Arabia buys the most
weapons from the US government. See what other countries top list.,\"
USA TODAY,
https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/03/26/us-arms-sales-these-countries-buy-most-weapons-government/39208809/

To identify the countries buying the most weapons from the U.S.
government, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the total value of arms exports from
the United States over the decade 2008 to 2018 delivered to the 183
countries available in SIPRI's Arms Transfers Database updated March 11
2019. The arms data cover actual deliveries of major conventional
weapons. The first, second, and third largest suppliers to each country
came from SIPRI's major arms export volumes report published March 11,
2019. These figures do not represent sales prices for arms transfers.
They should therefore not be directly compared with gross domestic
product (GDP), military expenditure, sales values or the financial value
of export licenses in an attempt to measure the economic burden of arms
imports or the economic benefits of exports. GDP per capita for each
country was obtained from the World Bank.

Risky Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy
-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full

BLOWBACK. [The fact [that the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has [[sold weapons to almost every
nation]{.mark} on earth]{.underline}, combined with frequent military
intervention, [[means]{.mark} that [blowback is]{.mark} an
**[inescapable]{.mark} outcome** of U.S. arms sales policy. [American
troops]{.mark} and their allies have [face]{.mark}d
[American]{.mark}-made [weapons in]{.mark}]{.underline} almost every
military engagement since the end of the Cold War, including in Panama,
Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, [[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, Yemen, and
Syria. [And even where the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has not yet engaged in combat, American [arms
sales]{.mark} have [bolstered the military capabilities of
adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} once counted as friendly.

[[Blowback can occur in]{.mark} at least [three ways. First, a
previously friendly regime becomes unfriendly]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [sold
billions of dollars in weapons]{.underline} to the Shah of Iran during
the 1970s in the hopes that Iran would provide a stabilizing influence
on the Middle East. The sales included everything from fighter jets for
air campaigns to surfaceto-air missiles to shoot down enemy fighters.70
After the 1979 revolution, [however, Iran used those weapons in its war
with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in
the region. Panama, the recipient of decades of American military
assistance]{.underline}, as well as host to a major military base and
9,000 U.S. troops, was a similar case. [In 1989, Gen. Manuel
Noriega---himself a CIA asset for more than 20 years---took power and
threatened U.S. citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that featured
American troops facing American weapons.]{.underline}71

[Blowback also occurs [when the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[sells]{.mark} weapons [to
nations]{.mark}]{.underline} (or transfers them to nonstate actors)
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, though not allies, simply [[did not
register as]{.mark} potential [adversaries]{.mark} at the time of the
sale. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, for example,
[sold]{.underline} surface-to-air [missiles]{.underline}, towed [guns,
tanks]{.underline}, and armored personnel carriers [to Somalia during
the 1980s. Few officials would have imagined that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would find itself intervening
in Somalia in 1992]{.underline}, or that the United States and its
allies would provide billions in weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq
in an effort to balance against Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq
on the battlefield to reverse its annexation of Kuwait.72

And finally, [blowback can occur [when U.S. weapons are sold or stolen
from the government that bought them]{.mark} and wind up on the
battlefield in the hands of the adversary.]{.underline} For example,
[the [Reagan]{.mark} administration]{.underline} covertly
[[provided]{.underline}]{.mark} Stinger **[[missiles to the
Mujahideen]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who were fighting the Soviets
[[in]{.mark} [Afghanistan]{.mark} during the 1980s]{.underline}; [they
in turn sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea, among others.
More recently, [the **I**]{.mark}slamic **[S]{.mark}**tate [managed to
captur]{.mark}e from the Iraqi government a stunning number of Humvees
and [tanks the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates had [[sold]{.mark} to
Iraq]{.underline} to rebuild its military capabilities after the 2003
invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to supply three
divisions of a conventional army.73

### 2AC\-\--US CT Fails

#### Current counterterror approach in Afghanistan is unsustainable

Wesley **Morgan 18**, military affairs reporter at POLITICO, 8/15/18,
"Whatever happened to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan?"
https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/15/al-qaeda-afghanistan-terrorism-777511

During the nearly two years since the last killing of a major Al Qaeda
plotter in Afghanistan --- Qahtani --- the counterterrorism task force
has killed a succession of top ISIS leaders in Afghanistan.

Divining [[the true intentions and capabilities of]{.mark}]{.underline}
a particular branch of a covert group like [[Al Qaeda has]{.mark} always
[been difficult and "subjective]{.mark}]{.underline}" [and always will
be]{.underline}, said Jeff Eggers, a former Navy SEAL commander who was
a senior Obama administration counterterrorism official. "Someone might
assess that they have the intent but not the capability right up until
the day they execute an attack in the West."

[[It's wise to treat Al Qaeda]{.mark} in Afghanistan [as an
international threat]{.mark} even if the evidence is
ambiguous]{.underline}, agreed Joshua Geltzer, a former senior
counterterrorism official in both the Obama and Trump administrations,
[[because intelligence on the group's true intentions is so
scarce]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The intelligence community's official assessment is that whether or not
they are planning missions abroad, both the remaining members of the
main Al Qaeda organization in Afghanistan and their colleagues in the
Afghan subgroup "maintain the intent to conduct attacks against the
United States and the West."

[[If Al Qaeda can't be destroyed]{.underline}]{.mark} in Afghanistan,
[[the default alternative]{.mark} for the military [is "perpetual
targeting to keep them in hiding]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Eggers.
"That may be effective, [[but it is also costly, and raises questions of
sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[[Endless military operations can never disrupt Al Qaeda's attacks
completely]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, said Jones, because [[the group
could always switch to]{.mark} [the ISIS attack
model]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [remotely cultivating homegrown
extremists who never set foot outside the West]{.underline}, let alone
make the arduous journey to a training site in the Afghan mountains.
That approach has allowed ISIS to claim credit for local extremists\'
shootings, bombings, stabbings and truck attacks from the United States
and Canada to the United Kingdom and France.

"Many attackers today don't need overseas training anyway," Jones said.
"They may not have really needed it in the past either, but attacks like
Manchester and Nice show that they certainly don't now."

[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. [All neighboring countries are

[incursions by combatants across their borders to stage attacks, recruit
fighters, or form alliances with local extremist groups]{.underline}.
All are concerned about [the safety of their nationals working in
Afghanistan]{.underline} (diplomats, development officials, train- ers,

[security of any economic projects that they are sponsoring or would

about having influence with the central government in Kabul and, in
Pakistan's case, with the governors and power brokers in the provinces
along its border.

[[In the event of]{.mark} conflict [escalation]{.mark} in Afghanistan,
[China would be in **direct contact with the**]{.mark} Afghan
**[government]{.mark}**, the [power brokers]{.mark} it has a

**[contain the fallout with]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example,
[stronger border **[security.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Iran would]{.mark} certainly [take similar

spillover]{.underline}**]{.mark} from an escalated Afghan conflict, but
otherwise its involvement would depend almost entirely on the state of
its conflicts and rivalries in the Levant and the Gulf, much
higher-priority areas than Afghanistan. If things settle down to its
west and south, Iran might turn some attention eastward to Afghanistan's
conflict. [[This would not be in the form of]{.underline}]{.mark} direct
**[[military incursions]{.underline}]{.mark}** but rather of funding,
military equipment, and possibly safe haven to Hazara, Tajik, and Uzbek
groups, as it has in the past, with a particular priority on protecting
Afghani- stan's Shi'ite minority.

[**[Saudi]{.mark}** Arabia, working with Pakistan, would probably offer
support to groups that oppose Iranian-support groups.]{.underline} Qatar
might follow Saudi Arabia's lead or it might offer to mediate talks
between opposing groups, as it has recently. **[Beyond that, [Qatar and
UAE would]{.mark} probably [stay out.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[[Russia would]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [increase its security

predictions]{.mark} about political trends [based on]{.mark} geographic
**[proximity]{.mark}**]{.underline} and facts that can be easily
displayed on maps, such as ethnic settlement patterns, population
density, and natural resources. [Such an approach]{.underline} has its
merits, but it also means **[[neglect]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [[other
details]{.underline}]{.mark}---[such as [culture, history and]{.mark}
political [practices]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}
can [[make]{.mark} [**all the difference** in understanding which
scenario plays out]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While the details of how a spillover might unfold are usually left
ambiguous, statements by defense and intelligence planners suggest the
following scenario: after NATO withdraws its troops, the Afghan
government, lacking a robust military presence and sufficient funds to
buy off rival power brokers, will weaken to the point of collapse or
find itself drawn into a civil war.

Then, sometime after, elements of Afghan chaos spread across to border
to the weak, corrupt and poorly governed Central Asian states, whose
populations share religious and ethnic ties with groups fighting in
Afghanistan. The result is a region-wide conflagration---collapsing
states, widespread violence, Islamic extremism, rising drug
trafficking---a nightmare scenario with dire implications for U.S.
interests. [We see three plausible mechanisms by which the]{.underline}
admittedly [unlikely spillover could take place: militants, refugees and
ideological inspiration.]{.underline}

[First, militants]{.underline} engaged in an Afghan civil war can cross
the Amu Darya to recruit Central Asians to their cause or to overthrow
their own governments. [For this to happen, two **assumptions** must be
correct:]{.underline} that NATO is holding back the deluge of militants,
and that [militants would]{.underline} indeed [target Central
Asia]{.underline}. In fact, NATO does not prevent Afghans from slipping
across now if they want to, so there is unlikely to be a major change
next year. Even if, technically, the crossing of Afghan borders with the
Tajik, Uzbek and Turkmen neighbors is easy thanks to corrupt
border-guard agencies, Central Asia has never been "invaded" by flows
coming from Afghanistan.

Borders do not keep all the bad guys (nor drugs or any other illicit
goods) out, but states are good at sealing borders when they want to,
and crossing the Pamir Mountains is not easy. If the recent past is any
guide to the present---and it should be---then [the [lack
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[militant penetration]{.mark} into Central Asia
[during the last]{.mark} Afghan [Civil War]{.mark}]{.underline}
(1992-96), [[when]{.mark} the post-Soviet [states were **much weaker,**
should give pause]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But [do militants actually have their sights on Central
Asia]{.underline}? Despite what the region's leaders have claimed,
[the]{.underline} [presence of]{.underline} anti-government Islamic
[groups is small,]{.underline} so [militants would be
starting]{.underline} almost [from scratch.]{.underline} Moreover, the
[[Taliban]{.mark} groups that may take power in Kabul [are **not
interested** in]{.mark} an all-out **[war with their
neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} some, such
as the Quetta Shura, [have [**explicitly stated** they will maintain
good]{.mark} economic [relations with]{.mark} the [Central Asia]{.mark}n
states, in part [because Afghanistan **imports electricity**]{.mark}
from the region]{.underline}. [They would]{.underline} therefore [be
unlikely to support calls for toppling established regimes.]{.underline}

If not a deliberate campaign by militants, [what about the inadvertent
spread of chaos through refugees]{.underline}? Here, the supposition is
that coethnic (Uzbek, Tajik) refugees fleeing violence in Afghanistan
stream across the border, overwhelm state capacity, and drive locals to
take up arms. A similar sequence of events can be seen in Central Africa
from Congolese refugees, or from the civil war in Syria. Yet unlike
those cases, [Central Asian governments are unwilling to
accept]{.underline} large numbers of [refugees and have the ability to
keep them out]{.underline}. [In the 1990s Afghan Civil War]{.underline},
despite the humanitarian need, the "frontline" states of [Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan]{.underline} [and Turkmenistan together took in only a few
tens of thousands of]{.underline} Afghan [refugees]{.underline},
[compared with 2.6 million in Pakistan and Iran.]{.underline}

So if the spread of people is unlikely, then what about ideas? For a
true mappist, this is the most enticing yarn to spin, as the religious
and cultural affinities appear from afar preordained to produce
spillover. If the Taliban ends up taking power in Afghanistan,
strategists fear a bandwagon effect, as locals try to emulate
Afghanistan and install new, Islamist regimes. But what kind of
inspiration could Afghanistan provide?

[Despite cultural similarities on the surface, Central Asians regard the
Taliban with disdain]{.underline}. They are justifiably fed up with
their corrupt, repressive leaders. But the image of protracted violence
in Afghanistan (followed by public executions, prohibitions on music and
alcohol, and stoning for adultery) is certain to weaken domestic
Islamists, buttress the legitimacy of secular-authoritarian regimes, and
convince ordinary people to accept the devil they know. [[Central
Asians]{.mark} interested in Islamic ideas tend to admire the Turkish or
the Malaysian model, and remain influenced by Islamic debates emanating
from Russia, but [do not consider the Taliban as a **model**]{.mark} to
follow.]{.underline}

U.S. officials must keep in mind that [the spillover narrative supports
two claims from Central Asian governments that are self-serving,
erroneous, and counterproductive for U.S. policy.]{.underline}

### AT: US Key

#### *[U.S.]{.underline}* has no impact on stability but *[regional states]{.underline}* will inevitably cooperate to prevent escalation 

SK **Chatterji 14**, Brigadier (Retired) of the Indian Army, 4/9/14,
"Afghan Stability: New Equations,"
<http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/afghan-stability-new-equations/>

With Afghanistan's presidential election likely heading for a second
round, it may be some time before the result is known. One issue the new
president will need to address, though, is [[the B]{.mark}ilateral
[S]{.mark}ecurity [A]{.mark}greement with the U.S., which]{.underline}
incumbent Hamid [[Karzai]{.mark} has]{.underline} resolutely **[[refused
to sign]{.underline}]{.mark}**, despite considerable pressure from the
U.S. and the looming pullout of the International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF). Karzai's stance may seem baffling, especially since the
BSA was endorsed by a Loya Jirga last November. But he [[may be]{.mark}
making [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[pragmatic judgment as to
Washington's]{.mark} long-term **[ability to keep the peace]{.mark}** in
Afghanistan]{.underline}.

The "zero option" that Washington has enunciated, if executed, [will
create a power vacuum]{.underline} in Afghanistan. Even if that option
were avoided and a limited American force of approximately 3,000 were
maintained, there would still be a steep drop in area dominance
capabilities, with Afghan National Security Forces left almost entirely
in charge. [The Taliban would doubtless attempt to fill the
vacuum]{.underline}.

[**[Equally certain]{.underline}**, [Afghanistan's neighbours would not
be comfortable with a radical Taliban]{.underline}]{.mark} exporting
terror to their countries across porous borders. [Even those that do not
share borders with Afghanistan would be concerned]{.underline}. [What
role might these countries play in the wake of the NATO
drawdown?]{.underline}

Among Afghanistan's more powerful neighbors is Iran. A Shia-majority
nation, it feels a sense of responsibility for the considerable Shia
population in Afghanistan. The two countries also share ethnic and
linguistic overlaps. Iran's concern for the Shia of Afghanistan is
evidenced in its past responses. Following the 1979 Russian takeover and
Afghan resistance, Iran provided support for the Persian-speaking Shia
groups. When the Taliban came to power, Iranians supported the Northern
Alliance partners. In 1998, when the Taliban overran Majar-e-Sharif and
massacred thousands of Hazaras and 10 Iranians with diplomatic papers,
Iran deployed its Army along its borders with Afghanistan.

Iran also faces a serious drug problem, with Afghan opium smuggled
across its borders. Moreover, it hosts more than two million Afghan
refugees.

In the recent past Iran has sought to increase influence primarily
through economic avenues. It has built roads, improved infrastructure,
and provided concessions enabling Afghans access to Chabahar Port,
allowing Kabul to avoid relying solely on Karachi. A railway link
connecting Afghanistan with Iran and Tajikistan is under construction.
Afghanistan has agreed to a friendship and cooperation pact with Iran.

Iran's deepening involvement in Afghanistan will undoubtedly not be
welcome in all sections of Afghan society. Internationally as well,
significant dissonance can be anticipated. However, progress with the
interim agreement on Iran's nuclear program has improved its image in
the U.S. and NATO countries, which may be more willing to accept a
greater Iranian role in Afghanistan.

[The [Central Asian Republics]{.mark}]{.underline} (CAR)
[[have]{.underline} **[deep interests and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[substantial [stakes in Afghan stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
those that share borders with Afghanistan the most important issue is
radical outfits potentially exporting terror and fundamentalism to their
countries. There are also sizeable ethnic minority groups in Afghanistan
with strong ties to the CAR. [An Afghan]{.underline} government
[collapse would]{.underline} likely [prompt an exodus of refugees to the
CAR]{.underline}, creating economic, security and political problems. In
the 1990s, the CAR attracted relatively few refugees; today, their
better economic conditions make them attractive options for those
wishing to flee a violent and unstable Afghanistan. Before the Taliban
came to power in Kabul, the CAR extended economic aid to Kabul in a bid
to provide stability. [Today]{.underline}, while individually [[these
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} may not be able to influence issues in
Afghanistan decisively, they [[could contribute to a force under a UN
flag]{.underline}]{.mark}, if such a force were deployed in Afghanistan.

[[China has]{.underline}]{.mark} hitherto [displayed]{.underline} only
[[an **economic interest** in Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing
is cognizant of the threat of an unstable Afghanistan and the possible
destabilizing influence it could have in China's west. Its huge economy
would be well served by the vast mineral deposits of Afghanistan, and
China is presently pursuing infrastructure links through the neighboring
CAR countries, with rail and road projects already underway.

China will want to maintain a lower profile in Afghanistan, as ethnic
differences and a lack of strong historical links may alienate the local
populace. Chinese-funded projects in Myanmar employing large Chinese
workforces have already faced similar situations. Beijing will also be
quite happy with the U.S. footing the bill for Afghan stability, with or
without the requisite boots on ground, while China draws on Afghan
natural resources to fuel its growth.

When it comes to political influence, [[China can deploy]{.mark} a slew
of [**economic incentives** while]{.mark} also [leveraging]{.mark} what
influence [**Pakistan**]{.mark} has [to achieve]{.mark} its
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, China would be uncomfortable
dealing with the Taliban. The recent attack in Kunming is bound to make
Beijing more cautious about fundamentalists from Afghan soil reaching
out to already troubled parts of its own territory.

As far as Pakistan is concerned, its traditional philosophy of
Afghanistan providing it strategic depth in a confrontation with India
makes it imperative that any regime in Kabul be subservient to
Islamabad. [A stable Afghanistan with Kabul under its influence is
central to Pakistan's Afghan strategy]{.underline}. [If violence erupts
on a large scale in Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Tehrik-i-Taliban
Pakistan]{.underline}, which has bases in Afghanistan, [will need to
relocate to the Northwest Frontier]{.underline} and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas, [exacerbating the problems Pakistan already
faces]{.underline}. Islamabad is reported to have advised the Karzai
government to form stronger bonds with China. [A China-Pakistan
dominance with China pouring in the funds and Pakistan acting as the
mentor for Kabul would suit Pakistani interests nicely]{.underline}.

Pakistan will also contest any move by India to establish strong
political and military influence in Afghanistan. The fear of being
hemmed in by Indians to the East and an Afghan regime with Indian
leanings to the West obsesses the Pakistani establishment.

Russia will of course wish to avoid a rerun of its bitter experience in
the 1980s. The fact that it no longer shares borders with Afghanistan
dilutes its concern. [[Moscow will]{.underline}]{.mark} naturally [[be
sensitive to insurgent groups]{.mark} based [in Afghanistan]{.mark}
developing adequate reach to find footholds in CAR
countries]{.underline} that remain in Russia's orbit. [[Moscow]{.mark}
is]{.underline} also [on record as having [stated]{.mark} its [readiness
to **maintain Afghan military equipment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

India lacks the capability to field a large force in Afghanistan for any
protracted period. Moreover, Pakistani opposition and the fact that
India and Afghanistan do not share land borders rules out that option.
Still, India maintains a good image among Afghan citizens. Should Iran
play a major role in Afghanistan, India may have an opening to step up
its role. Indians and Chinese could also work together: Both countries
want a stable Afghanistan, have invested substantial capital in the
country, and anticipate business opportunities. New Delhi could, for
instance, help train Afghan forces.

The sudden deterioration of the situation in Ukraine raise issues of
import for Afghanistan's future. The U.S. rebalancing to Asia, its
deteriorating relationship with Russia, and the ongoing global war on
terror barely permit it the resources to police Afghanistan as well.
Western priorities are shifting, and the focus on Afghanistan is fading
perceptibly. Combined with greater acceptance of Iran by Western powers
and the steady rise of China, new equations in Afghanistan are all the
more probable.

Afghanistan will in all likelihood require the deployment of outside
forces to maintain stability after the ISAF withdrawal. Even if the zero
option is not executed, and a force of approximately 3,000 or even
15,000 remains, the Taliban is likely to gradually expand the areas
under its control. Neither the U.S. nor EU countries will have the
appetite for another redeployment at that stage. The Russians will not
want to get involved. With Indians out of contention and the Chinese
unlikely to pursue anything beyond business interests, [[a
**multi-national** force drawn]{.mark} primarily [from **regional
countries** may be the **most viable option**]{.mark}]{.underline}

to Trump: don't overburden us with your Iran issues",
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/iraqi-president-to-trump-.html

[Iraqi President]{.underline} Barham [[Salih]{.mark}
[rebuffed]{.mark}]{.underline} President Donald [[Trump's]{.mark}
[insistence]{.mark}]{.underline} on Sunday [[that]{.mark} [the
U.S]{.mark}. [would maintain]{.mark} a [military presence in
Iraq]{.mark} [to "watch Iran]{.mark},"]{.underline}
[[telling]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[America]{.mark}n leader **[not to
burden Iraqis]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} his own [political
drama]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[Don't overburden Iraq with your own issues\... [We are not part of the
U.S. battle with Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}," [Salih said]{.underline}
during an international forum in Baghdad, adding that [[he did]{.mark}
[not give Trump permission]{.mark} to use his country as a
base]{.underline} to "watch Iran."

[Trump expressed]{.underline} his [intentions for continued a U.S.
presence]{.underline} in the war-weary country during an interview with
CBS aired Sunday, [saying Iraq was "perfectly situated" to keep an eye
on Iran]{.underline} and other countries in the region. The president
had previously called for drawing down troop numbers in the country
after having campaigned on ending years of U.S. warfare in the Middle
East.

[Iraq]{.underline} has [long]{.underline} been [characterized as a
playing field for competing powers]{.underline}, with Iran enjoying
significant influence in the majority-Shia country since the American
invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003. The U.S., as well as its
Gulf allies, view Iran's fortified presence in Iraqi politics as a
direct threat to their interests and to regional stability.

"[We spent a fortune]{.underline} on [building]{.underline}
[this]{.underline} incredible [base]{.underline}, [we might as well keep
it]{.underline}," Trump told CBS, alluding to the Ayn al-Asad Airbase in
western Iraq. "And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I
want to be looking a little bit at Iran."

He denied wanting to attack the Islamic Republic, however, saying, "All
I want to do is be able to watch."

"[[We're going to keep watching]{.underline}]{.mark} and we're going to
keep seeing and if there's trouble, [if somebody is looking to do
nuclear weapons]{.underline} or other things, we're going to know it
before they do," he said.

[The [remarks drew]{.mark}]{.underline} [[opprobrium from Iraqi
officials]{.mark},]{.underline} [[revealing]{.underline}]{.mark} what
appeared to be [a distinct [divergence]{.mark} [from
Washington's]{.mark} long-stated [mission]{.mark}]{.underline} of
remaining [[in]{.mark} [Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} to support local
forces in counterterrorism efforts.

Salih told media at the forum that [[the agreement]{.mark} between
Baghdad and the Pentagon was [focused on
counterterrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and that [[any actions
pursued]{.mark} [beyond]{.mark} that [would be
"**unacceptable**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[He]{.underline} also [stressed the importance of maintaining
harmony]{.underline} with Tehran, with whom Iraq has \$12 billion worth
of bilateral trade each year. "[[It is]{.mark} of fundamental [interest
for Iraq]{.mark} [to have good relations with
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" he said.

[Iran's]{.underline} [geographical]{.underline}, [cultural]{.underline}
and [religious ties to Iraq]{.underline} --- particularly much of its
Shia population --- as well as its [role in the anti-ISIS
fight]{.underline}, make it a heavyweight in the country.

American military officials have been in negotiations with the Iraqi
government over plans to potentially expand their presence there to
retain proximity to Syria following Trump's order in December to
withdraw all troops from the country.

Some fear that [[Trump's]{.mark} [remarks]{.mark}]{.underline} could
derail those [plans and [erase]{.mark} [any]{.mark} potential [goodwill
from Iraq]{.mark}i officials]{.underline}, [some]{.underline} of whom
have [called [his intentions a **violation**]{.mark} **[of Iraqi
sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Iraq]{.mark}'s deputy speaker]{.underline} of parliament, Hassan Karim
al-Kaabi, [[labeled the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} leader's comments
[[a]{.mark} "blatant and overt [violation of sovereignty and national
will]{.mark}]{.underline}," according to Kurdish-Iraqi news website
Rudaw.

More than a year on from declaring victory against the Islamic State,
Iraq is often described as being at a crossroads, caught between
competing forces --- the U.S. and Iran --- that it neither wants to
alienate nor allow to run its domestic affairs.

"The U.S. is a major power," Salih said. "But [[do not pursue
your]{.mark} own policy [priorities]{.mark}, [we live
here]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[Iranian president]{.underline} Hassan [[Rouhani]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[returned]{.mark} [from]{.mark} his first-ever trip to **[Iraq with
a raft of agreements]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} expanded

with Baghdad.]{.underline}

[[Leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} of both countries **[[embraced
strengthening ties]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- something [[Washington has
been watching closely]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Iran is upping its game]{.underline} in Iraq [as [U.S. influence
recedes]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[deepening]{.mark} [ties]{.mark} with its

activity [[to]{.mark} help **[offset]{.mark} tough [sanctions]{.mark}**
[imposed by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration.

[[Iraq is "another channel]{.mark} for Iran [to bypass]{.mark}
[America's]{.mark}]{.underline} unjust [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}
\... this trip will provide opportunities for Iran's economy, " a senior
Iranian official on the trip was quoted as telling Reuters last week.
The [Trump]{.underline} administration [reinstated sanctions on Iran
last year]{.underline} for what it deemed "destabilizing and malign
activities around the world," [and the country's economy
has]{.underline} since [been in a tailspin]{.underline}.

[[With]{.mark} a massive]{.underline} [[shared border]{.mark} and
[religious]{.mark} and [cultural ties]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} the major role of Iranian-backed paramilitaries in
Iraq's defeat of the Islamic State --- the [Islamic Republic's influence
in Iraq is entrenched]{.underline}.

[[Rouhani]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} Iraqi Prime Minister Adel
Abdul-[[Mahdi]{.underline} [signed memorandums]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
understanding [across]{.mark}]{.underline} sectors including
[[trade]{.mark}, [oil]{.mark}, [health]{.mark}, [mining]{.mark},
[visa]{.mark}-free [travel]{.mark}, and]{.underline} perhaps most
significantly a [[railway]{.underline}]{.mark} that would connect Iraq's
southern oil-rich city of Basra to Iran's border.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [is grappling with the extent and
limit of U.S. sanctions and power to counter Iran]{.underline} in a
country like Iraq with such deep social, economic and cultural ties to
Iran.

**[[U.S. officials]{.mark} [see]{.mark} [Iran's growing inroads into
Iraq]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} they [don't like it.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"[[Iran's actions are aimed at subverting]{.mark} [Iraqi]{.mark}
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} and [making Iraq dependent on
Iran]{.underline}," a senior State Department official told CNBC on
Monday. He echoed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent charge that
Tehran wanted to turn Iraq into a "vassal state."

In turn, [[Rouhani]{.underline}]{.mark} has [seized]{.underline} on [the
opportunity to **[scold the U.S]{.mark}**]{.underline}., [telling
Iran]{.underline}ian media last week [that]{.underline} his country's
ties with Iraq "[cannot be compared to]{.underline} Iraq's [relations
with]{.underline} an occupying country like [[America]{.mark}, which [is
**hated in the region**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Iraqi President Barham [[Salih praised]{.mark} Iran's
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}, saying, "Iraq is lucky to be a
neighbor with Iran, " and [[describing]{.mark} **[good relations with
Iran as "a fundamental interest for Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline}."
Baghdad has sought to balance its ties with the U.S., Iran and the Gulf
Arab states to avoid being a victim of the rivals' turf wars.

#### Trump's travel ban ruined Iraq relations and any future repair of the relations

[Tim **Arango**](http://www.nytimes.com/by/tim-arango) **17,** Tim
Arango is a Los Angeles correspondent for The Times. Before moving to
California, Mr. Arango spent seven years as Baghdad bureau chief,
covering the drawdown of American forces in Iraq, the rise of the
Islamic State, the downfall of Prime Minister Maliki, the return of the
American military, and the offensives against the Islamic State in
Falluja and Mosul, 1/30/17, "'You Have Let Us Down, Trump': Iraqis See
U.S. Relations Recast", New York Times
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/world/middleeast/iraq-trump-refugee-ban.html

The day he took office, Mr. **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** became the
fifth president in a row to bomb Iraq. He has also suggested that he
would put more military resources into Iraq, where American forces are
working closely with Iraqi troops in the battle to retake Mosul from
Islamic State militants, to make good on his promise to eradicate the
group "from the face of the earth."

But in his first days, he also [[**insulted Iraqis,** **saying**]{.mark}
that [the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [should have
**taken their oil**]{.mark}**,** and may do so yet. And, perhaps **[most
painfully, he announced]{.mark}** a new set of [**restrictions**]{.mark}
that would [**bar Iraqis** from **resettling** in the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [**and**]{.mark} even
**[visiting]{.mark}**,]{.underline} at least for a time.

"At bottom, [it [sends the message that **America sees Iraqis as
untrustworthy**]{.mark},"]{.underline} Kenneth M. Pollack, a longtime
Iraq analyst at the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email. "[That
they are **[not]{.mark}** our **[partners]{.mark}**. It [reinforces
Trump's idea of]{.mark} taking their [oil]{.mark}; [that **we**
**don't** **view** **them as allies** **but**]{.mark} something much
**[less]{.mark}** than that."]{.underline}

Mr. Trump has explained his executive order as a way to keep America
safe from terrorism, but officials and analysts say that it is likely to
hinder his efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, also called ISIS or
ISIL, given that the United States is leaning on the Iraqis to do most
of the fighting.

["It is going to **[alienate]{.mark}** the whole of **[Iraq]{.mark}**
against the man[, to say]{.mark} to all Iraqis, '[You are not
welcome]{.mark} in our country,']{.underline}" said Mouwafak al-Rubaie,
a member of Parliament and a former national security adviser in Iraq.

The [[issue]{.mark} could also [**become** a]{.mark} political
[**liability** **for**]{.mark} Prime Minister]{.underline} Haider
al-[[**Abadi**, who has spoken]{.mark} optimistically [about expanding
cooperation]{.mark} between Iraq and the United States]{.underline}
under Mr. Trump in the fight against ISIS. [[It will be
**difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Mr. Rubaie said, for Mr. Abadi
[[**to** **justify**]{.mark} to the Iraqi public [a **close relationship
with the U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [when the country is
closing the door on Iraqis.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"This is going to be a huge embarrassment for the prime minister," Mr.
Rubaie said.

On Monday[, **[Iraq]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**'s** Parliament
**[voted]{.mark}** to ask the government **[to]{.mark}** respond by
**[barring Americans]{.mark}** from the country]{.underline}. It was
unclear whether the government would do so, and in a statement issued on
Monday the Foreign Ministry was more cautious, asking that the United
States reconsider the policy.

Other leaders, including the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and the
spokesman for Iraq's paramilitary units that have been fighting the
Islamic State, said that Americans should be barred from Iraq.

Fifty-year-old Iman Hussain, center, was reunited with her two
daughters, residents of New Jersey, at Kennedy Airport after being
detained for more than 30 hours.

Mr. Abadi's spokesman took a more measured approach, saying that the
executive order should not affect security cooperation between the
countries.

Henri J. Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that [the [**barring**
**of Iraqis**]{.mark} from the United States [**would** work **against**
**American** **efforts** **to stabilize Iraq**]{.mark} once the Islamic
State was defeated.]{.underline}

**era of nation-building**]{.mark} will be

[[**US** **forces**]{.mark} must [**remain** **in Iraq** so]{.mark} the
United States [can **keep a close eye on**]{.mark} neighbouring [**Iran,
according** **to**]{.mark} Donald **[Trump]{.mark}**]{.underline} on 03
February 2019. Trump apparently was referring to the Al-Asad airbase in
western Iraq, where he paid a brief visit to US troops in December. The
base hosts American soldiers but belongs to the Iraqi army.

[**[Both Iraq\'s president and prime minister hit back]{.mark}** at
Trump\'s statements]{.underline} to US media this week stating American
forces should stay at a base in Iraq so Washington can \"watch Iran\".

Iraqi]{.underline} [President]{.underline} Barham Saleh [said that
**[Trump did not ask for permission]{.mark}** to use Iraqi territory to
monitor Iran, adding [Iraq\'s **constitution forbids**]{.mark} the [use

[Iraq\'s most senior Shia religious scholar]{.underline} on 06 February
2019 [joined a chorus of criticism aimed at]{.underline} President
Donald [Trump]{.underline} who said US troops should stay in the country
to keep an eye on neighboring Iran. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said
Iraq aspires to have \"good and balanced relations\" with all of its
neighbours \"based on mutual interests and without intervention in
internal affairs\". **[[Iraq \"rejects being a launching pad for harming
any other country\",]{.underline}]{.mark}** he said during a meeting
with UN Iraq envoy Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert at the Muslim leader\'s
base in Najaf.

### UQ\-\--Partnership Now

#### Iran-Iraq relations are improving and solidifying \-\-- turning Iraq away from the US

Ellie **Geranmayeh 3/13**, ECFR policy fellow, 3/13/19, When Iran goes
to Iraq: The significance of Rouhani's trip,
https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_when_iran_goes_to_iraq_the_significance_of_rouhanis_trip#

[[The visit is part of a **political, security, and economic** strategy
Tehran is pursuing after]{.mark} the [United States]{.mark} withdrew
from the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline} and subsequently reimposed
[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Iranian economy. Iran is eager
to counter the US strategy of placing it under "maximum pressure",
particularly in terms of ensuring that countries on its border remain
friendly. [Tehran is fully alert to growing US pressure on the new Iraqi
government to roll back Iranian influence in Iraq.]{.underline} After
expending resources to fight ISIS in Iraq, [Tehran is keen to secure the
gains it has made and to ensure no political faction in Iraq turns
against it.]{.underline}

Through this visit, Tehran has sent a clear political message to the US
that, while American forces have the upper hand in Iraq's airspace,
[Iran is the major external **player** on the **ground**]{.underline}.
The trip follows US President Donald Trump's unannounced visit to an
airbase in Iraq last December, which raised many eyebrows for breaking
protocol (as did Trump's subsequent remark that US troops ought to
remain in Iraq to "watch Iran"). Unlike Trump, [Rouhani was openly and
formally hosted by the Iraqi government, meeting with an array of Iraqi
factions and competing political leaders.]{.underline}

[One of Rouhani's most significant meetings was with Iraq's highest
religious authority]{.underline}, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani (who
once rejected a meeting with former Iranian president Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad), in Najaf. This meeting sent an important signal to
Rouhani's domestic opponents, who have often been at odds with his
government over its relatively moderate foreign policy proposals.
Iranian conservative media outlets were quick to point out that
Rouhani's trip to Iraq was possible due to the sacrifices of Iran's
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). This meeting also sent a
message to the US, whose presidents have never been received by Sistani,
that Iraq cannot be coerced to turn against Iran.

On a practical level, [[Rouhani's visit led to an array of
agreements]{.mark} that are [set to ease trade and travel between Iran
and Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} (although most are memorandums of
understanding rather than binding contracts). This comes at a time when
Iran is keen to offset the economic damage of US sanctions through
expanded trade with its immediate neighbourhood. Indeed, since
Washington reimposed sanctions on Iran, [Iraq has become one of the
country's top trade partners and the Iranian government has significant
amounts of money held with Iraqi banks.]{.underline}

Given the hit to Iran's global banking interests resulting from US
secondary sanctions, Iran is now reportedly looking to Iraq to provide a
payment channel in a similar way that it looked to Turkey under
Obama-era sanctions. But this is a tall order, given that Iraq is
struggling to fulfil its current financial obligations to Iran. Last
month, Iran's oil minister criticised Baghdad for failing to pay,
through adherence to US sanctions, for \$2 billion in Iranian energy
imports. At a minimum, Iran is keen to ensure that it will be paid for
the services and goods it exports to Iraq.

Therefore, [[Rouhani's trip]{.mark} also [delivered a **strategic
message**]{.mark}: [Tehran expects Iraq to stand by Iran]{.mark} in its
economic hardship, in [the]{.mark} same [way]{.mark} that [Iran]{.mark}
was the [first to stand by Iraq in its fight against
ISIS]{.mark}.]{.underline} While Baghdad is set to resist US pressure
and maintain close ties with Tehran, it remains to be seen how much it
can ease Iran's pains, especially at a time when Iraq is facing its own
challenges in the post-ISIS reconstruction era.

### UQ O/W Link

#### Their Stratfor card flows neg \-\-- UQ overwhelms the link\-\--counterterror means the relationship is [inevitably stron]{.underline}g\-\--growing anti-U.S. sentiment proves

**Stratfor 19**, geopolitical intelligence platform, 3/4/2019, "Like It
or Not in Iraq, U.S. Ties Are Here to Stay",
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/it-or-not-iraq-us-ties-are-here-stay>,
ezc

Why Washington Remains [[Maintaining]{.mark} a [presence in Iraq is
critical]{.mark} for the United States to pursue its own regional goals,
including countering Iran\'s influence and presence in the country, as
well as cooperating with its regional allies on counterterror
measures]{.underline}. This is why, [even after former President Barack
Obama\'s major drawdown of troops in 2011, a sizeable contingent of U.S.
forces remains in Iraq to this day]{.underline} --- working alongside
Iraqi security forces to fight the Islamic State, among other terrorist
groups and sources of instability. Leaving Iraq would also open the door
for the United States\' regional rival, Iran, to take its place. Iran is
intent on retaining control over its political capital in Iraq,
especially as widening U.S. sanctions on Iranian commercial ties
threatens the vast web of Tehran\'s economic inroads and business ties
in Iraq. U.S. ally Israel has also threatened to strike Iranian proxies
within Iraq --- including thousands of Iran-backed militia members who
are part of the popular mobilization units --- should they start to
threaten Israel with missiles. In addition, removing U.S forces from
Iraq would also alarm Washington\'s Arab allies, such as Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which it has been encouraging to
invest in Iraqi reconstruction efforts to help counter Iran from doing
[so. Beyond supporting the Iraqi federal government in Baghdad,
[Washington\'s relationship with the]{.mark} Kurdish regional
[government]{.mark} in Arbil [will]{.mark} likely [become]{.mark} even
more [valuable]{.mark} as well, as it tries to reassure allied Kurdish
forces that it is not wholly abandoning all Kurds in the wake of its
withdrawal from the Syrian territories]{.underline}, where U.S. forces
have worked closely with Syrian Kurds for years. [[However,]{.mark} both
the [economic **threat of**]{.mark} **U.S. [sanction]{.mark}s**, as well
as the physical threat of a potential strike on Iraqi militia forces,
[have]{.mark} also [fired up **pro-Iranian Iraqis**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(both in Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq) [who want to defend
against foreign interference]{.underline} --- [[contributing to]{.mark}
the momentum of [anti-U.S. sentiment]{.mark} now building [in
Baghdad]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Rise of Anti-U.S. Sentiment
Over the past year, [an increasing number of [nationalist and
Iran-allied politicians]{.mark} have begun [call]{.mark}ing for
[the]{.mark} Iraqi [government to]{.mark} consider **[expel]{.mark}ling
[U.S. forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and to reassess Iraq\'s
relationship with the United States more broadly. This was recently
evidenced [when President Donald Trump visited U.S. troops in Iraq in
December and ruffled political feathers by not meeting with Iraqi
leaders while he was there]{.underline}. Qais al-Khazali, who is head of
one of the major Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq, quickly seized
on the upheaval following Trump\'s visit by publicly calling for an end
to the U.S. occupation of Iraq. And [while [not all Iraqis support
politicians]{.mark} such as al-Khazali\'s close alliance with the
Iranian government, [many]{.mark} do [share]{.mark} their
anti-imperialist and **[anti-Western sentiment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
graphic showing the party breakdown in Iraq\'s National Assembly. [The
**[election of]{.mark} a more [nationalist parliament]{.mark}** in May
2018 [laid]{.mark} the political [groundwork for]{.mark} some of the
[increasing **backlash** against the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates\' extended stay in Iraq. Cross-sectarian coalitions,
like that of nationalist Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr, won the most
seats by running campaigns that called for Iraqis to reject imperialist
projects in their country]{.underline}. And Iranian-allied political
blocs with deep militia ties, such as that of politician Hadi al-Amiri,
won the second-highest number of seats. [[Washington\'s]{.mark}
hardening [resolve to limit Iran\'s influence]{.mark} and economic
activity across the Middle East [has also fueled Iraqis\' **growing
discontent**]{.mark}. Iraq is one of the biggest foreign markets for
Iranian goods and services, meaning its citizens would suffer if Iraqi
companies were no longer able to easily transact with Iranian
companies.]{.underline} Political Constraints However, pleas from Iraqi
lawmakers and the public to reassess their country\'s ties with the
United States --- no matter how noisy --- won\'t ultimately succeed in
fundamentally changing U.S.-Iraq relations. Any bill to expel the United
States from Iraq would also require amending the Strategic Framework
Agreement signed by former President George W. Bush in 2008, which
stipulates that U.S. forces are in Iraq only at the invitation of the
Iraqi government. Iraqi President Barham Salih, for one, has expressed
his support for retaining the agreement and Baghdad\'s bilateral
relationship with Washington. This also means that even if parliament
were to pass such a bill amending the agreement (majority support
doesn\'t seem to currently exist), the final decision would go to
Iraq\'s Supreme Court because it involves matters of national security.
As long as Iraq's security concerns remain acute, the country\'s ties
with Washington are unlikely to break. Nonetheless, [the [debate in
Baghdad will]{.mark} continue to [rage on]{.mark} --- **deepening
divisions** between Shiite political leaders who fall on opposing
sides]{.underline}. The resulting [[gridlock will]{.mark} further
[thwart]{.mark} the Iraqi government\'s ability to finish [basic
functions]{.mark}, such as completing the appointment of its Cabinet
where the justice, interior and defense minister posts still remain
vacant.]{.underline} In the near future, this means [that the government
will also struggle to address the unrest in Iraq\'s southern provinces
expected this summer when temperatures rise and water and electricity
shortages become more acute.]{.underline} No End in Sight With that
said, [this current flare-up of anti-U.S. sentiment is, of course, part
of the long-standing fallout from the U.S. invasion in
2003]{.underline}. When Washington forcibly removed Saddam Hussein, it
inadvertently gave its rival Iran an opening in the Shiite-majority
country --- which Tehran has taken advantage of ever since. This
complexity has only increased in recent years, with the United States
stating that it wants regime change in Tehran. But [**[above all
else]{.mark}**, the enduring [severity of the **counterterror fight** is
what has kept]{.mark} --- and will continue to keep ---
[relations]{.mark} between Iraq and the United States [as]{.mark} firm
as [they are]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While the territorial
caliphate of the Islamic State is largely defeated, the U.S. Defense
Department recently assessed that the group was still a potent force in
Iraq, adding that it could also resurge in Syria without appropriate
pressure to keep it down. This sobering assessment has solidified
Iraq\'s dependence on both U.S. forces and Iranian-backed militias,
which are both integral in helping Baghdad on the front line of its
grueling counterterror fight. Therefore, as long as Iraq's security
concerns remain acute, the country\'s ties with Washington are unlikely
to break.

### No Internal Link\-\--2AC

#### No impact to Iraq-Iran relations and they're inevitable\-\--security and economic interdependence means it stays stable

Paul **Pillar 19**, senior fellow at Georgetown University\'s Center for
Security Studies, 3/15/19, "Good Iraqi-Iranian Relations Are Not A
Reason To Worry,"
https://lobelog.com/good-iraqi-iranian-relations-are-not-a-reason-to-worry/

[Iranian President Hassan [Rouhani has been visiting Iraq]{.mark} this
week---**[a friendly]{.mark}, extended [visit]{.mark}** that has yielded
several bilateral agreements on trade and transportation.]{.underline}
Such an event causes heartburn, of course, within the Trump
administration and for others who believe that the only useful thing to
do to Iran is to try to isolate and cripple it. History and geography
have pushed Iraq and Iran to strive for close and cordial relations
today. It is the sensible thing for each state to do. And Americans need
not suffer heartburn because of it. Iraq and Iran share a 900-mile
border and at times have shared difficulties along the border such as
restive Kurdish minorities and an old boundary dispute along the Shatt
al-Arab waterway. Such geographic cohabitation has long carried the
potential both for trouble and for cooperation. [The shah of Iran, for
example, assisted an insurgency by Iraqi Kurds as a form of pressure on
Baghdad but stopped doing so as part of an agreement in which Iraq made
concessions regarding the location of the boundary along the Shatt
al-Arab. [A formative experience for both countries was]{.mark} the
devastating [war]{.mark}, which Saddam Hussein started, [between Iraq
and Iran]{.mark} in 1980-1988]{.underline}. The war caused hundreds of
thousands of casualties. [[For Iran]{.mark}ian leaders, [the]{.mark}
indelible [lesson was]{.mark} the need [to]{.mark} have a
**[regime]{.mark} in Baghdad [friendly]{.mark}** enough [toward
Iran]{.mark} never to do what Saddam did. [Iraq]{.mark}, which also
suffered mightily in the war, [came away]{.mark} from the conflict
[with]{.mark} similar lessons about [the need to **have a stable
relationship** with its neighbor]{.mark} to the east]{.underline}. The
Trump administration's effort to get everyone in the world to join in
its campaign of ostracism and punishment of Iran is colliding with these
geographic and historical realities. [[Iraqis]{.mark} of various
political stripes [see]{.mark} the [U.S. coercion of Iraq]{.mark} to
join the pressure campaign as a misguided attempt to export an obsession
and as contrary to Iraq's own interests, and the **[Iraqis resent
it]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [resentment was clear last month when
President Trump said in an interview that he wanted to keep a U.S.
military base in Iraq "partly because I want to be looking a little bit
at Iran because Iran is a real problem." Iraqi President Barham Salih
spoke for his countrymen when he responded, "Don't overburden Iraq with
your own issues...We live here."]{.underline} The senior and highly
respected Shiite cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, stated,
"[[Iraq rejects]{.mark} being a station for [harming any other
country]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[In addition to]{.mark} the **[security
reasons]{.mark}** that both [Iraq and Iran have]{.mark} for keeping
their relationship stable and not making trouble for each other, there
are **[economic reasons]{.mark}**. Iraq as well as [Iran needs]{.mark}
the [bilateral trade]{.mark}. [Iraq]{.mark} especially [depends on
**imports of**]{.mark} **Iranian natural [gas and electricity]{.mark}**
to meet its energy needs. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi notes
how Iraqis suffered from a U.S.-imposed economic blockade during Saddam
Hussein's rule]{.underline} and states, "Iraq will not be part of the
sanctions regime against Iran and any other people." [Iraq and Iran
still have their differences and disagreements, but Iraqis are aware
that the **most consequential thing Iran has done** in Iraq in recent
years has been to **assist the Iraqis** in liberating the large part of
western Iraq that had come under the rule of the so-called Islamic State
(ISIS]{.underline} or IS). [[Iran has been]{.mark} the most
[important]{.mark} source of outside **assistance [in defeating
IS]{.mark}**---assistance that is unburdened by any talk about keeping
military bases on Iraqi soil for the unrelated purpose of "looking" at
rivals of Iran]{.underline}. Awareness of this assistance is probably
one reason Rouhani has enjoyed a successful visit with all the
trimmings, including a full slate of meetings with Iraqi officials,
businessmen, and tribal leaders. In contrast, President Trump's foray
into Iraq last December was a quick, unannounced, middle-of-the-night
drop-in to a U.S. military base without meeting any Iraqi leaders. One
of the principal consequences of the regime-changing war that an earlier
U.S. administration launched in Iraq 16 years ago has been a marked
increase in Iranian influence in Iraq. Now a different U.S.
administration is apparently bent on changing another regime while
exhibiting similar disregard for, or misunderstanding of, relevant
regional realities and likely consequences. [The makers of the 2003 war
surely did not intend to increase Iranian influence in Iraq, and thus
the heightened influence must be considered another failure of that
war.]{.underline} But now that the influence exists, [it is not worth
losing any more American sleep over it, at least not without asking
"influence for what?"---especially given that [the **most conspicuous
objective** Iran]{.mark} has [pursued in Iraq is]{.mark} one the United
States shares: [the **defeat of IS**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United
States still has an interest in post-Saddam Iraq being a stable,
prosperous, and peaceful country[. It thus is against U.S. interests to
pressure Iraq into participating in economic warfare that is damaging to
Iraq itself.]{.underline}

### Iran Defense\-\--2AC

#### Tension with Iran is inevitable but won't lead to war 

Ilan **Goldenberg 6/4**, Director Of The Middle East Security Program At

Would Look Like,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-06-04/what-war-iran-would-look

[[Tensions between Iran]{.mark} and [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [are at their **highest**]{.mark} **point in
years**]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} 2015 Iran [nuclear agreement is
**teetering**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [Trump]{.mark} administration
[is using sanctions to **strangle the**]{.mark} **Iranian
[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and in May deployed an aircraft carrier,
a missile defense battery, and four bombers to the Middle East.
[Washington has evacuated]{.underline} nonessential personnel from [its
embassy in Baghdad, citing intelligence suggesting that Iran is
increasingly willing to **hit U.S. targets** through its **military
proxies**]{.underline} abroad.

[The **U**nited **S**tates also stated that Iran]{.underline} almost
certainly [perpetrated the recent **damage to oil tankers**]{.underline}
[flagged by Saudi Arabia, Norway, and the]{.underline} United Arab
Emirates ([UAE]{.underline}) [and claimed that Iran had temporarily
loaded **missiles** onto small boats in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}.
In early May, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton publicly
threatened a response to any Iranian attacks, "whether by proxy, the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards \[sic\] Corps or regular Iranian forces."

[[The good news]{.mark} is that **[the situation is not as bad as it
appears]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[No]{.mark}ne of the
[players]{.mark}]{.underline}---with the possible exception of
Bolton---[seem to really [want a **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Iran's]{.mark} military [strategy is]{.mark} to **[keep tensions at a
low boil]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **avoid**]{.mark} **a [direct
confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. Washington struck a tough public posture with
its recent troop deployment, but the move was neither consequential nor
terribly unusual. [[If the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [were
truly preparing for]{.mark} a [war, the flow of military assets]{.mark}
into the region [would be]{.mark} much [more
dramatic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Iran Defense\-\--1AR

#### Iran is weak\-\--poor economy, inferior weapons, and can't win a multifront attack

Ben **Hubbard 18**, Middle East correspondent for The New York Times,
5/13/18, "With Demise of Nuclear Deal, Iran's Foes See an Opportunity.
Others See Risk of War.,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-mideast-conflict.html

[[Iran would **struggle to defend itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[against]{.mark} a direct, multifront [attack by Israel, the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} the [gulf
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As a Persian, Shiite-led state, it is a sectarian and ethnic minority in
a predominantly Sunni Arab region. Spurned internationally since a
revolutionary Islamic government seized power in 1979, [[it has
no]{.mark} access to [Western weapons. And Iran's **poor
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[means]{.mark} that its [regional foes
have outspent it]{.mark} on conventional weapons]{.underline}.

Instead, Iran has invested where it could: in relationships with
substate actors that mostly share Iran's Shiite faith and sense of
underdog status.

The prototype for that strategy was Hezbollah, which officers from
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps helped create in Lebanon in
the early 1980s. Supporting Hezbollah gave Iran a means to fight the
Israelis near Israel's northern border, and later gave Iran a hand in
Lebanese politics. Hezbollah, which Israel and the United States have
long regarded as a terrorist organization, has since grown into a
regional force in its own right.

"**[[Iran is]{.mark} actually [not as strong as we
think]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Bassel F. Salloukh, a
political-science professor at the Lebanese American University in
Beirut. "[Its economy is quite weak, [it is surrounded, so it has to
project power]{.mark} in order [to protect itself]{.mark},]{.underline}
and that strategy has worked very well, so they are duplicating it
elsewhere."

#### War small and unlikely\-\--the US would wreck them and neither side wants to fight

Rick **Gladstone 18**, editor and writer on the International Desk of
the New York Times, 7/23/18, "Should We Be Anticipating War With Iran?
No, but It Could Get Nasty,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/world/middleeast/iran-us-conflict-explainer.html?login=smartlock&auth=login-smartlock

[There is little question]{.underline} that [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates would prevail in a conventional war,]{.underline} an
outcome not lost on the Iranians when the United States quickly toppled
the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and routed the Taliban from power in
Afghanistan.

Just judging by statistics, **[the [conventional]{.mark} United States
[military dwarfs Iran's in every way]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[There
are]{.mark} roughly [1.3 million active]{.mark} American [military
personnel]{.mark}, nearly **[triple that of Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Annual [military spending]{.mark} by the United States [exceeded \$600
billion]{.mark} last year, [versus]{.mark} about [\$16]{.mark} billion
[in Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [Americans have]{.mark} nearly
[6,000 tanks, versus]{.mark} fewer than [1,700 in
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [aerial and naval forces]{.mark} of the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} --- more than 13,000 aircraft and
nearly 300 battle vessels --- [vastly [outnumber
Iran's]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[That does not mean]{.underline} Mr. [[Trump]{.mark} is ready to back
his threats by [invading Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [such a
possibility,]{.underline} on the contrary, [[is seen as
**nonexistent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mr. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
has said he [[wants]{.mark} to get the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [[out of foreign]{.mark} military
[entanglements]{.mark}, and Americans have shown little appetite for
another war.]{.underline}

"**[I don't see an [actual war]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [[it's not in
anyone's interest]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Barbara Slavin, director
of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a
Washington-based research group. "[Trump doesn't even want to keep boots
on the ground in Syria]{.underline}."

#### Iran war doesn't escalate -- Responsive selective bombing avoids war

Victor Davis **Hanson 19**, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,
6/20/19, "U.S. Holds All the Cards in the Showdown with Iran,"
https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/us-iran-showdown-american-position-strong/

[But what worked then may not work now. The [U.S. is]{.mark} not only
the [world's largest producer of oil]{.mark} and natural gas, but soon
to become the largest exporter of energy --- and without getting near
the Iranian coast. Likewise, American [allies]{.mark} in the Middle East
such as Israel [are energy independent.]{.mark} America's Arab friends
enjoy seeing competing Iranian oil all but off the market.]{.underline}

[[Time]{.mark}, then, [is on the Americans' side. But]{.mark} it is
certainly [not on the side of a bankrupt and impoverished Iran]{.mark}
that either must escalate or face ruin.]{.underline}

[[If Iran starts]{.mark} sinking ships or [attacking U.S. assets, Trump
can]{.mark} simply [replay the ISIS strategy of selective off-and-on
bombing.]{.mark} The U.S. did not lose a single pilot to enemy
action.]{.underline}

[Translated, that would mean disproportionately replying to each Iranian
attack on a U.S. asset with a far more punishing air response against an
Iranian base or port. The key would be to avoid the use of ground troops
and yet not unleash a full-fledged air war. Rather, the [U.S. would
demonstrate]{.mark} to the world [that Iranian aggression determines the
degree to which Iran suffers]{.mark} blows from the U.S.]{.underline}

[Of course, Tehran may try to stir up trouble with Israel through its
Syrian and Palestinian surrogates. Iran may in extremis also stage
terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S. And it may lie that it has
already developed enough fissionable material to launch a nuclear
missile.]{.underline}

[But the truth is that [America has all the cards and Iran none in its
game of chicken.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Because [Iran]{.mark} is losing friends and money, it [will have to
escalate.]{.mark} [But]{.mark} the U[.S. can respond without looking
weak and without going to war]{.mark} --- and without ensuring the
return to power of the political party responsible for giving us the
disastrous nuclear deal that had so empowered Iran in the first
place.]{.underline}

Trump administration for its obsession with Iran and notes that it has
little relationship to Iran's regional power:

Trump and his aides appear to have embraced the view that Iran is a
potential hegemon poised to dominate the Middle East --- and
specifically to control the oil-rich Persian Gulf. This logic helps make
sense of Trump's unswerving support for Saudi Arabia, including his
endorsements (both tacit and explicit) of the political shake-ups
organized by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at home and his apparent
efforts to interfere in Lebanon's internal politics.

It also explains Trump's refusal to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in
October. Yet this ongoing full-court press against **[Iran]{.mark}**
makes little sense because it **[is nowhere close to being a regional
hegemon]{.mark}**. If anything, the willingness of pundits and
politicians to embrace this alarmist fantasy says more about the
cavalier nature of U.S. strategic discourse than it does about the
actual challenge Iran may pose. As Walt explains, [Iran doesn't have the
resources]{.mark} **to become the region's hegemon**. **[Its [military
and economic power]{.underline} are]{.mark} both [inadequate]{.mark}**
to the task, and that isn't going to change in the foreseeable future.
While Iran is an important regional power, it is not in a position to
dominate the region. The [people claiming]{.mark} [otherwise]{.mark} are
simply trying **to [[scare Congress and the public]{.underline}]{.mark}
[into endorsing misguided and destructive regional policies]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} serve no discernible American interest and [risk]{.mark}
more [[unnecessary wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Conjuring up the specter
of [Iran]{.mark} as a possible regional hegemon is worse than threat
inflation. [It is threat invention]{.mark}. Alarmist claims that Iran
was "on the march" throughout the region engaged in an "imperial"
project of "expansionism" have plagued our foreign policy debates for
many years, but it was only when Trump took office that the hard-liners
advancing those claims gained a receptive audience in the White House.
For at least the last five years, Iran hawks have been warning us about
the dangers of an imaginary Iranian "empire" during the exact period
when the growth of Iranian regional influence stalled and even went into
reverse across much of the Middle East. At the same time, the same hawks
carefully ignored the most significant thing the U.S. did to increase
Iranian influence in the last fifteen years, namely the invasion of Iraq
and the ousting of the old Iraqi regime. It is not an accident that the
people most preoccupied with hurting Iran have frequently backed
policies that have worked to benefit that regime. The aggressive
policies they favor tend to backfire or have unintended consequences,
and [their foreign policy judgment is reliably poor]{.mark}. Even if
there were a danger that Iran might become a regional hegemon, it would
be folly to follow their advice on how to prevent that, and it is a
measure of how shoddy their analysis is that the danger they warn about
isn't real. **The most destructive and costly consequence of these bad
ideas has been the ongoing rationalization of an atrocious Saudi-led war
on Yemen that Washington and Riyadh have dishonestly framed as
"countering" Iranian "expansionism**." That has made it possible for an
indefensible policy of U.S. support to go mostly unnoticed and
unchallenged for the last two and a half years, and it has given both
the Obama and Trump administrations undeserved political cover for their
disgraceful enabling of Yemen's destruction and starvation. [U.S.
policy]{.mark} [in Yemen]{.mark} [would]{.mark} still [be]{.mark}
[outrageous]{.mark} [and shamefu]{.mark}l in any case, [but]{.mark} it
[is]{.mark} made [even]{.mark} [more so because it has been wrapped up
in this lie.]{.mark}

#### Iran is weak now -- Infighting, economic struggles, limited military, few allies

Daniel **Byman 18**, professor at Georgetown University\'s Walsh School
of Foreign Service, 1/3/18, "Iran's foreign policy weaknesses, and
opportunities to exploit them,"
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2018/01/03/irans-foreign-policy-weaknesses-and-opportunities-to-exploit-them/

[Iran]{.underline} is often painted as a powerful monster whose
tentacles stretch across the greater Middle East, but the Islamic
Republic [suffers from]{.underline} array of [problems at home and
abroad.]{.underline} The latest [protests]{.underline}---the most
serious the regime has faced since 2009---[highlight the regime's
unpopularity]{.underline} among its own people. [Iran's [problems
limit]{.mark} its [power and create openings for undermining]{.mark} its
[influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even if the protesters fail to topple
the regime, the United States and its allies should recognize that
[[Iran's foreign policy is]{.mark} shaky and [vulnerable]{.mark} in its
structure of political authority, its economy, its military and its
diplomatic posture. Iran's [weaknesses will reduce]{.mark} Iran's
[clout, foster infighting, and otherwise make it difficult for the
regime to increase its sway abroad.]{.mark}]{.underline} Some of these
weaknesses may also cause additional internal unrest if not managed
properly.

Iran's biggest problems stems from the unusual, and often unwieldy, dual
system of government that mixes elections with a powerful Supreme
Leader. The Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, exercises a veto over Iranian
decision-making, heads the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the
judicial system, and state television, among other powers.
[[Khamenei]{.mark} is almost 80 years old]{.underline}, and rumors say
that [[he will step down.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although Khamenei's role
is supposedly based on his religious authority, his [religious
credentials were]{.underline} always [suspect]{.underline}, and he lacks
the charisma of his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei. The
[current leader gained his authority through revolutionary action and
political loyalty, not careful theological study, but he was able to
cement his power and grow the institution of the Supreme
Leader.]{.underline}

[[Succession may go smoothly]{.underline}]{.mark}---and Khamenei
certainly has tried to plan for this---[[but the possibility of
infighting looms.]{.mark} His successor will inherit the institutions
tied to the Supreme Leader position, but is likely to share Khamenei's
weak religious credentials]{.underline}: None of Iran's most learned
theologians are revolutionary die-hards, and as a result, succession
will go to someone below the top clerical rank. Thus, the supreme
political authority who exercises his power in the name of religion is
likely to remain distinct from the non-political clerics who are more
skeptical of the system. The revolutionary elites are likely to hang
together so as not to hang apart, but much depends on the specific
leader chosen and the politics of that moment.

[[Whomever takes power may need time to consolidate it, and in such
authoritarian transitions **power struggles**]{.mark} **among competing
elites [are common.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In general, [the]{.underline}
Islamic [Republic has shown a gift for managing these struggles and
balancing fierce factionalism, but]{.underline} that
[[balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} act [[may prove harder under a new and
possibly weaker leader.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In addition to uncertainty at the top, [Iran's economy remains
vulnerable.]{.underline} The latest protests began over economic issues
before turning political. The [economy]{.underline} was [shrinking
before]{.underline} the lifting of [sanctions]{.underline}, but
sanctions relief---including additional export opportunities and the
unfreezing of assets---have improved the economic situation, with the
growth rate at roughly 7 percent in recent years and inflation
stabilizing. However, **[[Iran's economy is plagued with
corruption]{.mark}, [and mismanagement]{.mark} is rife.]{.underline}**
The IRGC and [various [religious foundations control much of the
economy, stifling competition and making reform]{.mark} far more
[difficult]{.mark}. [Private investment remains skittish]{.mark},
especially outside the energy sector. The [low price of oil
makes]{.mark} these [structural problems]{.mark} all the [more
painful.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In addition to these problems, popular expectations of prosperity are
higher than they have been for many years. The lifting of sanctions
fostered hope that incomes would rise and economic problems would
diminish---the regime now has less ability to blame the United States or
other enemies for its problems. Protests are a fact of life in
Iran---few are massive, sustained, or tied to a broader political cause,
but all show at least some level of dissatisfaction with the regime.
Indeed, Hassan Rouhani's election and those of his political allies was
in part because of his promises to improve Iran's economy due to
sanctions relief.

In addition to a weak economy, [Iran's [military power is also
limited.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The [expeditionary skill]{.mark} of the
IRGC [coupled with]{.mark} Iran's [use of proxies]{.mark} in Iraq,
Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen]{.underline} often create a sense that Iran is
militarily active throughout the Muslim world. This is true, but it also
[[highlights]{.underline}]{.mark} one of Iran's biggest weaknesses---its
[[lack of conventional military strength.]{.mark} Tehran lacks the
ability to project significant amounts of conventional power beyond its
borders.]{.underline} Iran's regular **[[ground and air forces are in
shambles.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In addition, [although it has acquired
and deployed more advanced air defense systems since the lifting of
sanctions, many of its [weapons systems are old,]{.mark} and at best, it
has limited access to advanced systems from Russia and China as well as
some missile technology from North Korea. Iran's [military often lacks
spare parts,]{.mark} [and it cannot maintain many of its
systems.]{.mark}]{.underline} Its own military industrial base can
produce and support basic systems but not the most advanced ones. As
analyst Thomas Juneau contends: Militarily, Iran can deter, deny, and
spoil, but it can rarely shape events. As a result, Iran can subvert its
neighbors, but it is vulnerable to conventional military pressure.

[[Tehran's soft power also has limits.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Iran has
always presented itself as]{.underline} a leader of a broader Islamic
resistance bloc despite being ethnically distinct (as Persians) and [a
religious minority]{.underline} (as a Shiite Muslim country). To
delegitimize the regime after the 1979 revolution, rival powers,
particularly Saudi Arabia, emphasized Iran's Shiite status, funding
preachers around the world who emphasized this sectarian divide and
otherwise trying to deny the revolution's religious credentials.

Iran could occasionally overcome its minority status, forging ties to
important Sunni groups like Hamas and, at times, gaining support from
Muslim publics for its opposition to Israel and the United States. The
post-2003 civil war in Iraq, which pitted Sunnis against Shiites there,
and especially the post-2011 Syrian civil war, where Iranian help was
instrumental in shoring up Bashar al-Assad's Alawite regime (the
Alawites have doctrinal similarities to Shiism) made Iran seem like a
far more sectarian actor than previously believed. This led Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, and others to play up sectarianism even more,
precipitating another proxy war in Yemen (despite the Houthis being
Zaydi, a different Shiite branch from the Iranian Twelvers branch).
Sunni public support for Iran has plummeted---a 2016 poll found that
over 70 percent of Arabs had a negative view of Iran, making it only a
bit more popular than perennial bugbears like the United States and
Israel. Groups like Hamas have reduced, though not ended, ties.

[[Iran has few friends, and those it has are relatively
weak.]{.underline}]{.mark} Syria is one of Iran's few close allies (and
that rarity explains the Iranian leadership's strong reaction to the
threat to Assad's regime). Tehran also has close ties to Haider
al-Abadi's government in Baghdad, where Iran has successfully prevented
a strong pro-U.S. and anti-Iran regime from taking power. Yet even in
Iraq, Iran remains unpopular with many in the country, and its allies
often try to distance themselves from Tehran as a result. Relations with
Pakistan and Turkey, two key neighbors (and historic regional rivals),
are cordial but not friendly. [Although Iran has stepped up relations
with Russia]{.underline} (another traditional rival with historically
divergent regional interests) to help the Assad regime, [additional
cooperation is limited and may decline as the regime moves away from the
brink of collapse.]{.underline} In addition, [I[ran has been frustrated
by Russia's on-again, off-again approach to arms sales, which are often
disrupted in response to U.S. pressure.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Tehran]{.underline} has at best a transactional relationship with major
military powers like China, and, as the poll mentioned above shows, [it
is loathed by much of the Muslim world. As [a result, when Iran is
threatened, **few countries come to its aid.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Link Turn\-\--2AC

#### Treating Iraq as a pawn in competition with Iran ruins the relationship

Michael W. **Hanna 19**, senior fellow at The Century Foundation,
non-resident senior fellow at the Reiss Center on Law and Security at
New York University School of Law, et al., 2/14/19, "Trump's Iraq
Strategy Is Foolish,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2019-02-14/trumps-iraq-strategy-foolish

[This time, however,]{.underline} [rather than talk of a drawdown,
[Trump argued]{.mark}]{.underline} in an interview with CBS' Face the
Nation [that [U.S. troops should remain in Iraq]{.mark}---not just to
continue to fight the **I**]{.underline}slamic **[S]{.underline}**tate,
or ISIS, [but [to]{.mark} "[watch]{.mark} Iran." U.S. bases in
Iraq,]{.underline} Trump suggested, [would serve as outposts for
monitoring [Tehran's activities relating **to "nuclear weapons or other
things."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump's comments are reckless]{.mark}. They reflect a misguided
obsession with Iran and [portray Iraq as]{.mark} little more than [a
pawn in]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' [[Iran policy. Such]{.mark} rhetoric
[is poison for]{.mark} Washington's [relationship with
Baghdad]{.mark}]{.underline}---one of the last remaining anchors for
U.S. influence in a region littered with dysfunctional and
counterproductive partnerships.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [invasion of Iraq
in 2003 and the disastrous occupation that followed opened the door to
Islamist militancy]{.underline} and sectarianism in the heart of the
Arab world, [while helping Iran to expand its power. The region---and
the world---continues to suffer the consequences.]{.underline} Yet
despite this tortured history, Iraq's leadership remains remarkably open
to U.S. diplomatic and security assistance.

One of us recently visited Baghdad and spoke to political leaders from
across the political spectrum, including critics of U.S. policy in Iraq.
Many of these leaders expressed the hope that Washington would continue
to support the Iraqi government in its efforts to improve security and
build state institutions. U.S. signals intelligence, above all, is
invaluable to the Iraqis; no other source can provide the satellite
imagery and overwatch to monitor potential new ISIS beachheads. With
American help in counterterrorism and intelligence collection, Iraqi
leaders surmise, the Iraqi government can defeat insurgents and grow
strong enough eventually to fend off outside meddling---both from the
United States and from Iraq's eastern neighbor, Iran.

[Ever since the U.S. drawdown in 2011, [Baghdad has had to perform
a]{.mark} careful [balancing act, maintaining]{.mark} friendly [ties
with both Washington and Tehran and using each to stave off dependency
on the other.]{.mark} "We don't like the American military presence in
Iraq,"]{.underline} a senior politician told us in January. ["But if
they leave suddenly, [Iran]{.mark} will fill the vacuum."]{.underline}
Behind closed doors, much of Iraq's political class agrees: until
recently, even members of the Sadrist movement, a group known for its
fiery nationalist rhetoric and armed resistance to the U.S. occupation,
tied calls for U.S. withdrawal to an insistence on the exit of all
foreign (read: Iranian) forces from the country.

[But the Sadrists and others [can only sustain this]{.mark} pragmatic
[position]{.mark} in public [if the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[avoids]{.mark} creating [the impression
that Iraq is part of a]{.mark} U.S.-led [anti-Iran]{.mark}, pro-Israel
[axis]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even sympathetic Iraqis perceive only
limited shared interests with the United States. And [[Iraq
needs]{.mark} the help it gets from [Iran]{.mark}, which has made major
[investments]{.mark} in the country's industrial and tourism
[infrastructure]{.mark} and is Baghdad's most important [trade]{.mark}
partner for [food and natural gas]{.mark}. Tehran also played a crucial
role in the [war against ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline} and provides
technical assistance to the Iraqi interior ministry and parts of the
intelligence apparatus. [Iraqi elites, as a result, are loath to
alienate Iran.]{.underline}

[But if [Iraqi]{.mark} hedging [requires a soft touch from the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates[,
[Trump delivered the]{.mark} polar [opposite]{.mark}.]{.underline} Iraqi
President Barham [[Salih rejected Trump]{.mark}'s interview as "strange"
and [warned the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[not to "overburden Iraq with your own
issues."]{.underline}]{.mark} Iraq's highest Shiite clerical authority,
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, also rebuked the U.S. president. The
Sadrists, for their part, sponsored a parliamentary resolution calling
for the expulsion of U.S. forces. Meanwhile, [the Asaib Ahl al-Haq
movement, a Shiite paramilitary group, suggested that it was ready to
once again take up arms against the Americans. Even if such
anti-Americanism is mostly bluster, the **change in tone is
alarming.**]{.underline}

Put simply, military and intelligence partnerships require discretion
and bedrock respect for the sovereignty of partners. [Iraq is willing to
host a wide variety of U.S. military assets]{.underline} and even turn a
blind eye to U.S. surveillance activities that are not related to the
fight against ISIS. But [[Iraqi leaders will have a]{.mark} much
[hard]{.mark}er [time]{.mark} doing these things [if the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[insists on calling attention to its assets and publicly [portrays Iraq
as a base]{.mark} from which to monitor Iran and protect Israel, as
Trump suggested.]{.underline}

### Alt Cause\-\--Trump

#### Trump messes up Iraq relations

Michael W. **Hanna 19**, senior fellow at The Century Foundation,
non-resident senior fellow at the Reiss Center on Law and Security at
New York University School of Law, et al., 2/14/19, "Trump's Iraq
Strategy Is Foolish,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2019-02-14/trumps-iraq-strategy-foolish

[Washington has made its help easy to accept by offering it at a
relatively low political cost]{.underline}. Iraq could not have defeated
ISIS without U.S. assistance, for example, but the United States did not
call in its debt by seeking excessive influence over Iraqi politics
afterward. [Iran, by contrast, has long tried to increase the power of
pro-Iran militias in Iraq's political system.]{.underline}

[As the United States begins pulling out of Syria and, potentially,
Afghanistan]{.underline}---a necessary, if poorly executed corrective to
U.S. overextension---[[Iraq is a test case for]{.mark} the value of
[continued engagement.]{.mark} At a moment of critical reflection on
U.S. commitments in the Middle East, Iraq offers an opportunity to build
diplomatic, security, and intelligence ties that defy recent trends and
deliver benefits to both sides.]{.underline}

[But [success]{.mark} ultimately [depends on the discretion and judgment
of an administration that has]{.mark} often [been lacking in
both]{.mark}, and which continues to view Iraq as ancillary to its main
regional objectives. Even [as Iraq struggles with]{.mark} major [energy
shortages]{.mark}, the [Trump]{.mark} administration [is urging it to
stop buying]{.mark} energy [from Iran.]{.mark}]{.underline} No amount of
diplomacy can overcome that level of myopia[. If [the United
States]{.mark} does not reframe its approach to Iraq, it [will succeed
in undermining one of the few remaining avenues for constructive
engagement in the region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Relations Low\-\--2AC

#### Relations are low now\-\--Iraq's ties with Iran strain the US-Iraq relationship

Gregory **Aftandilian 18**, lecturer at the Pardee School of Global
Studies at Boston University and a former U.S. State Department Middle
East analyst. 2/2/2018, "Iran sanctions are testing US relations with
Iraq",
<https://thearabweekly.com/iran-sanctions-are-testing-us-relations-iraq>

However, [[the admin]{.mark}istration['s Iran sanctions]{.mark} policy
[is]{.mark} severely **[testing the US-Iraqi
relationship]{.mark}**.]{.underline} US national security adviser [John
Bolton's comment that the administration wants to "squeeze them \[the
Iranians\]]{.underline} until the pips squeak" [[runs counter to
the]{.mark} strong [economic and cultural ties between Iraq and
Iran]{.mark} that have developed since the toppling of Saddam
Hussein.]{.underline}

[Even though it has substantial oil resources, [Iraq is dependent on
Iran for]{.mark} a significant portion of [its energy needs]{.mark};
natural gas from Iran accounts for 45% of Iraq's electricity
consumption]{.underline}, the Wall Street Journal reported.

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[granted Baghdad a 45-day waiver from]{.mark} its most [recent
sanctions]{.mark} against Iran [but]{.mark} US energy officials
[acknowledged]{.mark} that [it will take]{.mark} Iraq [much longer to
develop alternatives]{.mark} to importing energy from Iran.]{.underline}

The United States is pursuing a two-pronged approach. It is encouraging
US energy companies to sign deals with Iraq to capture natural gas from
some of its oil fields to be used to produce electricity. It is also
pushing the Saudis to invest in energy and electricity projects in
southern Iraq, an area that faced severe electricity shortages over the
summer that led to widespread protests.

[Outside of the energy sector, there is much trade between Iran and
Iraq. From March through October, for example, Iraq imported about \$6
billion in non-crude Iranian goods.]{.underline} In addition, Iran has
developed medical facilities along the Iran-Iraq border to attract
medical tourism from Iraq and has invested in infrastructure in Shia
holy cities in southern Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iranian religious
pilgrims visit those sites every year, which helps to shore up Iraq's
economy.

In short, [[it would be difficult for Iraq to]{.mark} substantially
[diminish its economic links to Iran.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Politically, [Iraqi leaders]{.mark} want to [show that, despite]{.mark}
their country's strategic [ties to the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[they will pursue]{.mark} an
**[independent foreign policy]{.mark}**, which includes
[maintaining]{.mark} friendly [relations with Iran.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Iraqi President Barham Salih travelled to Tehran in November for
high-level meetings. [[Salih and Iran]{.mark}ian leaders [pledged to
boost economic ties]{.mark} despite the US sanctions.]{.underline}

Shortly after Salih's visit, [Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-[Mahdi
said Baghdad would not respect the US sanctions on Iran, which he
described as]{.mark} an **[American "diktat,"]{.mark}** not an
international decision that has UN approval.]{.underline}

Interestingly, the United States has not openly criticised those
statements by Iraqi leaders but is clearly worried about Iraq's ties to
Iran, particularly in the military sphere. One of the demands on Iran
that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo enunciated in May, when the
United States pulled out of the nuclear deal, was for Tehran to not
hinder the "disarming, demobilisation and reintegration of the Shia
militias," also known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), in Iraq.

The PMF played a crucial role in defending Baghdad in the summer of 2014
when the Islamic State was on the march and helped to defeat the
jihadist group. Although the PMF includes Shia factions with varying
loyalties, a significant part of its forces is under the sway of
pro-Iran factions. Iran's al-Quds force, the intelligence arm of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been instrumental in training the
PMF.

US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert has reiterated that
Tehran "must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit
the disarming, demobilisation and reintegration of Shia militias." In
response, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry rejected what it said was US
"interference" in Iraq's internal affairs and Abdul-Mahdi pledged to
continue to support the PMF.

It is not just the Trump administration that opposes the PMF and wants
its disarming and demobilisation. The US Congress has become involved
through bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives, called
the Iranian Proxies Terrorist Sanctions Act, that would sanction several
groups within the PMF. Prominent members of Congress have pressed the
Trump administration on why it has not designated such groups as
terrorist organisations, given their close ties to Iran.

[Despite its efforts, the [Trump]{.mark} team['s policy of trying to
nudge Iraq away from Iran]{.mark} through a carrots-and-sticks approach
[is **unlikely to succeed**]{.mark} because Iraq's leaders see merit in
maintaining multifaceted ties to Iran.]{.underline}

### Alt Cause\-\--Sanctions\-\--2AC

#### Iraq can't comply with US sanctions on Iran\-\--pushes them into regional partnership with Iran in the status quo

Geneive **Abdo 18**, resident scholar at the Arabia Foundation, 8/15/18,
"Trump's Iran sanctions are backfiring in Iraq,"
https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-iran-sanctions-are-backfiring-in-iraq-trade-gas-supplies/

As soon as the most recent round of U.S. sanctions, announced by the
Trump administration on August 7, hit Iran, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al Abadi said his country would reluctantly comply. But a week later,
reality has sunk in and many [Iraqi officials have pushed for Baghdad to
**maintain trade relations with Tehran**]{.underline}.

The reason: [[Iraq]{.mark}, which shares a]{.underline} 1,458-kilometer
[border with Iran, [could be]{.mark} **badly [hurt by]{.mark} the
[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Iraq relies on its eastern neighbor
for everything from gas supplies to electricity to water and
foodstuffs.]{.underline} [Not only is Iraq in a no-win position, but it
is the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, [which still
maintains]{.underline} some 5,200 [troops in Iraq, that put it
there]{.underline}: [The country's dependence on Iranian trade and
public services is largely due to the U.S. invasion in
2003.]{.underline}

When the international community imposed sanctions on the late Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein from 1990 to 2003, next-door Jordan was exempt.
The United Nations excused Jordan from sanctions that banned it from
buying oil from Iraq, for instance. So there's a strong precedent for
exempting Iraq from the Iran sanctions.

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} that doesn't happen, and [[Iraq violates
sanctions]{.mark} and is hit by U.S. penalties, [it is likely to place
the country]{.mark} further [into Iran's sphere of
influence]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [exactly what]{.underline} President
Donald [Trump's administration says the **U**nited **S**tates wants to
combat in the broader Middle East, where Iran is becoming **increasingly
powerful**]{.underline}.

Even Abadi, who is considered to be more pro-American than his
predecessor, cannot afford to comply with sanctions. He has been
backpedaling since last week. On August 13, he said: "I did not say we
abide by the sanctions, I said we abide by not using dollars in
transactions. We have no other choice," the prime minister told
reporters in Baghdad.

The U.S. has reimposed sanctions on precious metals, including gold, the
automobile industry, and the purchase of U.S. dollars. Beyond what Abadi
announced about trade in dollars, the government in [Baghdad says it has
not come to agreement on whether to comply with other
sanctions]{.underline} --- [a buzzphrase for
**noncompliance**]{.underline}. Abadi has already faced a significant
backlash from Iraqi and Iranian politicians merely for suggesting at
first that Iraq would comply with sanctions.

According to Iraqi media reports, U.S. Treasury officials visited the
Central Bank of Iraq in July and said the U.S. would sanction any Iraqi
bank that conducted financial transactions with Iran. According to the
Wall Street Journal, the Iraqi government has bank accounts with the
U.S. Federal Reserve, where its dollars are kept. And these dollars,
which the Iraqi economy relies upon, could be frozen should Iraq violate
sanctions.

[Despite]{.underline} such [possible hardships, **[Iraq has no choice
but to violate]{.mark} sanctions**]{.underline}, for several reasons.

First, [[Iraq needs Iran's refined gas]{.mark}. Iraq's electricity
minister said]{.underline} in July 2017 that [Iraq would be reliant on
Iranian gas to generate electricity for at least seven years. Iraq does
produce natural gas of its own, but lacks the facilities to process it
into fuel for local consumption.]{.underline} The gas Iraq receives from
Iran constitutes approximately 20 percent of the electricity it
produces. Already, Iraq meets only 70 percent of its electricity demand.
Iraq has been sending Iran oil to pay for its gas imports and to pay its
electricity debt.

Second, [[Iraq's water supplies are dependent]{.mark} upon the flows of
the Euphrates and Tigris rivers from where it gets 98 percent of its
surface water]{.underline}. [If it chose to do so, Iran could divert 13
percent of Iraq's water resources.]{.underline} Iraqi Deputy Water
Minister told Gulf News in April that 20 to 30 percent of the Tigris
River's water in Iraq originates in Iran. [If Iraq complies with
sanctions, **[Iran could]{.mark} easily [cut]{.mark} the flows of
[water]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it already has done in the northern
Kurdistan area in Sulaimaniyah province, according to the Kurdistan
regional government's Ministry of Agriculture. **[At a time of serious
drought in Iraq, this is no idle threat]{.underline}**.

Third, [[Iran has]{.mark} deliberately [flooded the Iraqi market with
cheap imports]{.mark}, such as foodstuffs. This has undercut Iraqi
agriculture by decreasing demand for homegrown products that are more
expensive]{.underline}. Even if Iraq were to stop buying these goods,
[farmers would not be able to produce enough supplies at

areas due to a lack of demand and conflict with the Islamic State. At
the moment, a decline in the numbers of farmers is also an obstacle.

[[Iran has political leverage]{.mark},]{.underline} too. Since the May
12 national election, [Iraq's political elites have been unable to form
a government in part because of enormous pressure from Tehran to install
politicians in their favor]{.underline}. If Iran's loyalists succeed and
dominate the new government, **[[Iraq's rulers will]{.mark} definitely
make decisions that [support Iranian interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The Gulf states and Turkey would seem to be a logical alternative to
Iranian trade. However, Iran has loosened Iraqi restrictions against it
by greasing the palms of local border and trade officials for years. It
seems unlikely that corrupt officials will seize the opportunity to
broaden Iraq's list of trading partners.

In general, while Gulf states object to Iraq's economic reliance on
Iran, [governments have done little to help Iraq become more
independent]{.underline}. [The Kuwait-sponsored reconstruction
conference to help Iraq,]{.underline} held in February, [has yielded no
results]{.underline}, according to Iraqi sources, even though millions
of dollars of pledges were made.

Once again, [Iraq is finding itself controlled by outside forces and
without any recourse at a time of widespread civil unrest in the country
over water and electricity shortages]{.underline}. [In penalizing
Iran]{.underline}, **[[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates

### Alt Cause\-\--Sanctions\-\--1AR

#### Trump's sanctions on Iran ruin US-Iraq relations and risk driving Iraq to Iran -- Iran becomes more economically dependent on Iraq

Salih's statement was a reminder not just to the Saudis but also to the
United States that **[[Baghdad]{.mark} is [uniquely vulnerable when it
comes to Iranian pressure.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And make no mistake:
Iran has big plans for Iraq. Although relations between the neighbors
have had their ups and downs, [[Tehran has invested deeply in
Iraq]{.mark}, both politically and economically, and these investments
will only multiply in the short term.]{.underline} After all, [U.S.
sanctions on Iran have made Iraq an essential link in Iran's potential
chain of commerce.]{.underline} How such plans play out will put the
Iranians, the Iraqis, and the administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump to the test.

The [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [imposed [on Iran in late 2018 are]{.mark} the most
[severe]{.mark} the country has ever experienced.]{.underline} By all
accounts, Tehran was not only surprised but caught flatfooted without a
backup plan. The [[Iranians]{.mark} had [banked on]{.mark} their
[European and Asian economic partners saving them]{.mark}]{.underline}
from President Trump's wrath by keeping trade channels open under the
framework of the 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran signed with the United
States and five other world powers.

[[Instead, country after country opted to play it safe]{.mark} and avoid
defying U.S. sanctions.]{.underline} The impact was swift and severe:
[Iran's trade]{.underline} with the 28 European Union member states
[dropped]{.underline} by nearly [83 percent]{.underline} from January
2018 to January 2019. Most notably, the Europeans stopped buying Iran's
oil, historically the lifeline of the country's trade with the
continent. In need of a stopgap solution, [**[Tehran turned to]{.mark}
its immediate neighbors**, such as]{.underline} Turkey, Afghanistan, and
[[Iraq]{.mark}, as trading partners who]{.underline}se continued
commerce [could help offset]{.underline} the [deep losses]{.underline}
imposed by U.S. sanctions.

When it comes to circumventing sanctions, geography matters.

When it comes to circumventing sanctions, geography matters. According
to the Trade Promotion Organization of Iran, an advocacy group connected
to the Interior Ministry, at this point U.S. sanctions cannot become any
tougher, and Iran's best option is to focus on boosting trade with its
immediate neighbors. The group urged [political leaders in
[Tehran]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[reorient]{.mark} the [country's
non-oil trade away from distant customers in favor of those nearer to
home.]{.mark}]{.underline} After all, among other problems U.S.
sanctions have created for Iran's long-distance commerce, they have
inhibited shipping and impeded Iran from financing and insuring its
commercial transactions---not to mention repatriating its export
earnings.

[[Iraq is politically close to Tehran and hence comparatively open to
Iranian exports.]{.underline}]{.mark} The bureaucracy of trade functions
more smoothly between linked economies, and transactions that don't use
U.S. dollars don't need to pass through financial institutions that are
forbidden to transact with Iranian entities. [Iraq is also
geographically closer to Iran, which helps Iran avoid the difficulties
it encounters with more distant trade.]{.underline} Hence the latest
talk in Tehran suggests making immediate neighbors the country's top
economic priority, since engaging with them is simply that much less
complicated than with others.

[C. International Treaties & Their Inherent Limits]{.underline}

Outside of the United States, the international community responded to
human rights abuses inflicted on children by enacting the Convention on
the Rights of the Child (CRC). 70 The CRC was adopted on November 20,
1989 and entered into force on September 2, 1990.n1 Currently, 193
countries have ratified the CRC. 72 [Somalia and the United States 73
are the only two countries that have signed]{.underline}, but have not
ratified the Convention.74 Under the CRC, a child is anyone under
eighteen years of age.7s The CRC requires that State Parties \"take all
feasible measures\" to ensure that children under eighteen do not engage
in direct hostilities.76 It further prohibits State Parties from
recruiting children under fifteen into the armed forces.77 The CRC also
imposes positive obligations on State Parties to promote \"recovery and
social reintegration of a child victim of\... armed conflicts.\"7 8
[While [the **international community** overwhelmingly **accepted the
CRC,** critics argue that the **CRC fails to consider** the
**complexities and environments** **that contribute to** the use of
**child soldiers**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 79 [This [leads to
the]{.mark} practical [difficulty of implementing its
articles]{.mark}]{.underline}.so Indeed, State Parties recently emerging
from internal conflict may not have the infrastructure and organizations
necessary to address the long-term needs of its former child soldiers.
8\' Therefore, the international community must act urgently and go
beyond merely condemning the practice in principle; it must take the
initiative to help countries reintegrate and rehabilitate these
children. In 2000, the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on
the involvement of children in armed conflict. 82 This Optional
Protocol, entered into force on February 12, 2002, directly addresses
the need for extra protections for children involved in armed conflict.
83 Unlike the CRC, the United States ratified the Optional Protocol on
December 22, 2002, and is therefore bound by its articles. 84 The
Optional Protocol places more stringent obligations on State Parties
than the original CRC. While the CRC requires States to refrain from
using children under fifteen in direct hostilities, the Optional
Protocol raises this age to eighteen.85 It also prohibits compulsory
recruitment of persons under eighteen into the armed forces. 86 Further,
the Optional Protocol directly addresses armed groups not affiliated
with a nation\'s government by prohibiting these forces from recruiting
or using soldiers in combat that are under eighteen.87 [In addition to
the Protocol\'s prohibitions, this treaty places positive obligations on
States to implement measures to demobilize any child soldiers in its
forces and adopt national laws to criminalize the
practice.]{.underline}8 8 International treaties and instruments, such
as [the CRC and its Optional Protocol regarding children in armed
conflict, are valuable and necessary tools to establish international
norms]{.underline}. In addition, they raise awareness, and in turn, the
support of the international community to collectively denounce human
rights abuses. However, these [[**treaties** are limited in
scope]{.mark} and [nature,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [they **tend to be
idealistic**]{.mark} rather than practicable. The [**U.N**.\'s
mechanisms **only bind** **State Parties that ratify the
treaties**]{.mark}; it [therefore has no authority over]{.mark}
countries that are not parties to the Convention or are [non-state
entities, such as rebel militias recruiting child
soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. 89 [[It **relies on** the **State
Parties** themselves **to** implement its doctrines and **prevent human
rights abuses**]{.mark} around the world. Therefore, most of the
responsibility in preventing such abuses lies with the individual
countries themselves. While the [U.N]{.mark}. views its treaties and
conventions as binding on State Parties, it [has no police power
mechanism to enforce its decisions]{.mark}; therefore, [the **CRC** and
its Optional Protocol **are \"limited by the signatories\' willingness**
to comply]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"90 The CRC, like other conventions,
relies on a reporting system.9\' Each State Party submits a report every
five years illustrating how that country has taken measures to implement
the CRC\'s rights. 9 2 The Committee on the Rights of the Child then
disseminates reports back to those countries, which make suggestions and
recommendations for improved compliance. 93 [[The CSPA]{.mark} is [meant
to complement and further]{.mark} the [goals of]{.mark} [these
international treaties.]{.mark} The [CRC and its Optional Protocol
have]{.mark} inherent [limits that make implementing procedures to
abolish the use of child soldiers]{.mark} unattainable without local and
national efforts. [The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates

IV\. EVALUATING THE CSPA IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

Congress enacted [[the]{.mark} [CSPA]{.mark}]{.underline} to further
[comply with the Optional Protocol]{.underline}.211 [In addition to
[mandating]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[each State]{.underline}]{.mark}
Party [[prevent]{.mark} the [use of child soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}
within its respective territories, [the CSPA [also places]{.mark}
positive [obligations]{.mark} [on]{.mark} states to
[help]{.mark}]{.underline} implement the [[protocol]{.mark} by
preventing activities]{.underline} [\"contrary\" to it]{.underline}.2 12
To comply with this mandate, [the United States]{.underline} described,
in its initial report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, how
it was cooperating internationally by [providing]{.underline}
humanitarian [aid]{.underline} to help demobilize and reintegrate child
soldiers. While these efforts are laudable and certainly helped
demobilize child soldiers[, **[the President\'s
actions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[through]{.mark} the CSPA
[waivers]{.mark} **[directly contravene the statute\'s]{.mark}**
intended **[goals]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the United States\' periodic report, [[the]{.mark} [Committee on the
Rights of the Child]{.mark} [expressed]{.mark}]{.underline} significant
[[interest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [CSPA]{.mark}]{.underline}
legislation.213 After receiving the periodic report, [the Committee
[recommended]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[cease
providing FMF to countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"[[where]{.mark}
[children are known]{.mark} to be-[or]{.mark} [may potentially
be-recruited]{.mark}]{.underline} or used in hostilities, **[[without
the possibility]{.mark} [of]{.mark} issuing
[waivers]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"214 It is evident that [the Committee
finds]{.underline} the issuance of CSPA [[waivers]{.mark}
[inconsistent]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the goals of [[the CRC
Optional]{.mark} [Protocol]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates responded by merely
reiterating the current CSPA language; it [failed to address why it
needed]{.underline} to issue such [expansive waivers]{.underline}.

The [[CSPA\'s]{.mark} goals]{.underline} clearly [[espouse]{.mark} the
[international norms]{.mark}]{.underline} delineated [in the
[CRC]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [its Optional Protocol]{.mark}]{.underline}
and with improvements, [it]{.underline} would
[[strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark} and enhance current [[international
laws and norms]{.underline}]{.mark} that are inherently limited in their
enforcement power. However, with the CSPA\'s present flaws, [the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} government\'s [current [actions fail to
implement]{.mark}]{.underline} both national and [[international
standards]{.mark} regarding the treatment of children.]{.underline}

[[The plight of child soldiers has caught]{.mark} people\'s [attention
around the world]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 It is undeniably painful to
visualize a young child carrying an AK-47, prepared to shoot an enemy at
a moment\'s notice. Stories like William\'s open our eyes to the
intolerable truth that youths are being forced into wars around the
world. Now that these children have our attention, it is time to give
them our help. [[The U]{.mark}nited States, as a first-world nation and
military superpower[, is obligated to help stop this]{.mark} horrid
practice.]{.underline} While the wars are fought far from U.S. soil,
Americans are intertwined with these children in ways they do not at
first suspect. For example, American soldiers encounter child soldiers
on battlefields, placing military personnel in difficult ethical
predicaments. During the War on Terror, a fourteen-year-old boy 4 killed
the first U.S. soldier to die in the war in Afghanistan.

Beyond direct encounters with child soldiers on the battlefields, [[U.S.
foreign policies influence the plight of child soldiers in other
nations. Our position as one of the most powerful nations]{.mark} in the
world [means that other countries]{.mark} often [look to us for
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}, seeking military financing, modern
weapons, and our highly-valued military training and education.5 \"[The
United States is the world\'s largest arms exporter]{.underline}\"6 and
provides military aid, financing, and training to war-torn countries
around the globe. 7 Before 2008, it was the U.S. policy to provide
military assistance to foreign governments regardless of the human
rights violations they committed by forcing children to fight in wars.
In 2008, Congress passed the Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA) to
stop the United States from handing over taxpayer money to governments
that use it to finance child soldiers.9 The CSPA amended the William
Wilberforce Trafficking Protection Reauthorization Act to include a
provision on child soldiers. 10 Former President George W. Bush signed
the bill into law on December 23, 2008, and it became effective on June
21, 2009.11 [The [CSPA prohibits the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[from sending military aid to countries identified as]{.mark} actively
[recruiting and using child soldiers in their]{.mark} official
[militaries or government-supported armed forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### It is impossible to track where weapons go -- 1 billion dollars worth of weapons from the US to Iraq were lost and found with ISIS

**Schatz 17**, Bryan Schatz, Inside reporter and magazine writer, former
teacher, 5/24/17, "The US Lost Track of a Billion Dollar's Worth of
Weapons in Iraq \-- Again",
<https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/us-weapons-iraq-isis-tracking-lost-again/>

In June 2014, Iraqi forces dropped their weapons, shed their uniforms,
and abandoned their posts as ISIS militants stormed into and [captured
Mosul](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/10/iraq-sunni-insurgents-islamic-militants-seize-control-mosul).
More than a year later, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates began
[funneling **\$1.6 billion** worth of]{.mark} new [weaponry]{.mark} and
other support [to the]{.mark} beleaguered [Iraqi
army]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
arsenal [included](http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2015/amendment/FY15_ITEF_J_ook_Final_November_20-2014.pdf)tens
of thousands of assault rifles, hundreds of armored vehicles, hundreds
of mortar rounds, nearly 200 sniper rifles, and other gear.

[[What happened to]{.mark} much of [it is]{.mark} now [a
**mystery**]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to a government audit
obtained by [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/05/us-military-admits-failures-to-monitor-over-1-billion-worth-of-arms-transfers/),
[th[e US Army admits that **it failed to**]{.mark} **accurately
[track]{.mark}** this recent infusion of arms and other [military
supplies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The now-declassified [Department of Defense
audit](http://www.dodig.mil/pubs/report_summary.cfm?id=7112), obtained
through a Freedom of Information Act request, reveals that [[efforts to
keep track of weapons]{.mark} being sent to Iraq [have been]{.mark}
plagued by **[sloppy, fragmented, and inaccurate]{.mark}** record
keeping]{.underline}. The audit concluded that the Army unit in charge
of transferring materiel to the Iraqi government "could not provide
complete data for the quantity and dollar value of equipment on
hand"---including large items such as vehicles.

[[This is not]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} development. "[If you]{.mark} do
[look back]{.mark} at previous audits, almost word for word, [you get
the same recommendations]{.mark} about the fact that [they can't
centralize records]{.mark}]{.underline}, they've got records spread
across different spreadsheets, [**[it's]{.mark} very
[difficult]{.mark}** [for them to locate weapons]{.mark} as they pass
down the chain]{.underline}," says Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty
International's arms control and human rights researcher. He notes that
some Iraqi supply records are hand-written paper receipts.

The problem predates the current conflict by more than a decade. In
2007, the [Government Accountability
Office](http://www.gao.gov/assets/270/264918.pdf) found that [the United
States could not account for nearly 30 percent of the weapons it had
distributed in Iraq]{.underline} since 2004---about 200,000 guns. [[The
situation does not]{.mark} appear to have [improve]{.mark}d much since
then]{.underline}. In 2015, the [Pentagon's inspector general reported
that [the Iraqi army relies on "a manual]{.mark}, paper-based [system
for tracking]{.mark} supplies and equipment."]{.underline} Even US and
Iraqi personnel supervising arms depots did not know where specific
weapons were supposed to be. Last year, Commander Elissa Smith, a
Defense Department spokeswoman, told [Mother
Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/why-iraq-black-hole-american-arms),
"[The bottom line is that [the US military **does not have** ]{.mark}**a
[means]{.mark}** [to track equipment]{.mark} that has been [taken from
the government of Iraq by" ISIS]{.mark}.]{.underline}
