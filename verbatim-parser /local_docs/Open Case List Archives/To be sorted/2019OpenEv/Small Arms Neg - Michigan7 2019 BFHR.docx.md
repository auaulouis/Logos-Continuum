### 1nc---circumvention---- CCL

#### Trump circumvents the aff -- he's putting small arms on the CCL list

**Taylor 18** -- Guy; is the National Security Team Leader at The
Washington Times, overseeing the paper\'s State Department, Pentagon and
intelligence coverage. He has reported from dozens of countries and been
a guest on the BBC, CNN, NPR, FOX, C-SPAN and The McLaughlin Group.
("Trump move would make it easier for U.S. gun manufacturers to export
firearms" The Washington Times. May 14, 2018.
<https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/14/trump-administration-moves-shift-small-arms-gun-ex/>)//GK

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [took a major]{.underline} formal
[step]{.underline} Monday [toward]{.underline} officially [**shifting
authority from the State Department to the Commerce Departmen**t
over]{.underline} the [approval of]{.underline} U.S. **[small arms
exports]{.underline}**, including semiautomatic rifles and weapons
ranging in size up to .50 caliber.

In a closed-door briefing for lawmakers, [State and Commerce officials
outlined specifics of the shift long sought by small arms manufacturers
as a **way to cut red tape and boost exports**]{.underline} --- but
decried by pro-regulation Democrats who warn the policy change could
dissolve barriers designed to keep U.S.-made firearms from criminals and
terrorists overseas.

While Congress could still block the initiative --- Monday's briefing on
Capitol Hill sets in motion a public comment period that lasts for 45
days --- [administration officials are touting the policy as
breakthrough for U.S. manufacturing and stress that key restrictions on
exports to unsavory international buyers will remain in
place.]{.underline}

What will change once the Commerce Department fully takes over as the
point agency for licensing on small arms exports is that [the
"regulatory burden on the U.S. commercial firearms and ammunition
industry" will be "**significantly reduce\[d\],"**]{.underline} says
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tina Kaidanow.

[**The shift will "promote American exports**,"]{.underline} Ms.
Kaidanow told The Washington Times, asserting that officials are also
"prioritizing national security controls and continuing our ability to
restrict exports where human rights, illicit trafficking, and related
issues may be of concern."

### 1nc---circumvention -- gray markets

The preceding [distinctions between legal and illegal trade is the entry
point to a more detailed model of illicit weapons flows.]{.underline}
Legal trades occur with either the active or passive involvement of
governments or their authorized agents, and in accordance with both
national and international law.55 The first category of illicit transfer
is the gray market. This category has two practical meanings. First,
[gray transfers consist of states]{.underline} or non-state actors [who
**exploit loopholes or intentionally circumvent laws** -- thus, these
transfers are not explicitly illegal]{.underline}.56 [These trades
include overt trades in **circumvention of the law**.]{.underline}
Secondly, [gray transfers **consist of covert transfers** from states to
states]{.underline} or to non-state organizations. [These transfers are
gray by virtue of being covert and clandestine -- **hidden from public
scrutiny.** Government-sanctioned gray transfers are "not explicitly
illegal," but covert transfer **implies circumvention of established
laws and norms for the manufacture, sale, and transport of these
weapons**]{.underline}.57 [Gray-covert transfers dominated the Cold War
era arms trade]{.underline}, as exemplified by the U.S. or the former
Soviet Union secretly arming surrogate states or revolutionary forces.58
[This type of **transfer continues to be a significant force and
delivers the weapons "most likely to be used in
conflict."**]{.underline}59 Gray transfers are transnational trades and
generally require brokering -- a means of providing clandestine "cover"
for governments or groups involved in the trade.60

Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) in Post Conflict
Peacebuilding" Research Gate. November 2015.

[Disarmament is the collection, documentation, control and disposal of
arms, ammunition, explosives and weapons in the possession of combatants
and civilians. Disarmament is]{.underline} also [concerned with the
development of legitimate arms and its management for security and
maintenance of peace.]{.underline} While demobilization is the official
controlled disengagement of active combatants from the armed groups
and/or armed forces. [The first stage demonization engagement involves
processing and placement of combatant in camps otherwise called
cantonment sites, encampments, assembly areas or barracks, the second
stage involves support packages geared to aid demobilized and this could
be referred as reinsertion. Reintegration is the reinstatement of
ex-combatants back into the society through their acquisition of
civilian status securing employment and income
opportunities.]{.underline} It is an economic and social process
basically at the local government/community level; also it is the prime
post-conflict development.

The [major element of DRR is to institute stability through security
reforms, social and developmental programs, those programs ensures the
establishment of a functional society by helping combatant and civilians
to transit from the previous hostile]{.underline} or unstable
livelihood/social [network into a viable one]{.underline}.6 This
socially and economically integrate combatants and civilians into a
long-term peaceful coexistence, induced productivity and development of
the society security reforms. However DRR in itself is not a replacement
of ideal development programs that should exist rather it helps in
creating a secured environmental ambiance for such programs to thrive7.

[Effective disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs
are **essential to limiting future proliferation and misuse of small
arms** and light weapons]{.underline}. When implemented properly, [DDR
programs **reduce the number of illicit weapons in circulation** and
provide opportunities for former combatants to pursue a livelihood in

[The PoA encourages states to develop]{.underline} and implement [DDR
programs]{.underline} that include small arms collection, control,
storage, and destruction [and]{.underline}, if states have the capacity

World Bank has a multinational program that coordinates DDR programs
throughout the Great Lakes region of Africa, the goal of which is to
develop programs for up to 350,000 ex-combatants in nine
countries.\[19\] Since the 2001 conference, high-profile DDR programs
have been established in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. [In Afghanistan,
donor governments, such as Japan, helped to pay the \$100 million tab
for disarming approximately 63,000 former combatants]{.underline},
decommissioning 250 former militia units, and providing reintegration
packages to 53,000 ex-combatants.

Weapons Collection and Disposal

[Stockpiles of surplus and obsolete small arms and light weapons are
attractive targets for arms traffickers]{.underline}, who often acquire
them from corrupt or unsuspecting government officials. The vast [Cold
War stockpiles in eastern Europe have been particularly
exploited]{.underline}, as evidenced by recent transfers to countries
under UN arms embargoes. For example, small arms shipments from Ukraine
to western Africa in 1999 and 2000 added 180 tons of assault rifles,
machine guns, MANPADS, anti-tank missiles, and ammunition to the
arsenals of former Liberian president Charles Taylor's rogue regime and
the Revolutionary United Front, an insurgent group that gained control
of Sierra Leone's diamond mines through a campaign of rape and
mutilation.\[10\]

Since 2001, [donor states have teamed up]{.underline} with several
countries [in eastern Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere to **destroy
surplus stockpiles of small arms and light weapons**. These programs
rank among today's **most important and cost effective**]{.underline}
aid programs. In the past five years alone, NATO countries have funded
the destruction of more than 4.5 million small arms and light
weapons.\[11\] Similarly, a modestly funded State Department program has
destroyed more than 800,000 surplus weapons, including 18,500 MANPADS,
and 80 million rounds of ammunition.\[12\] [Despite its obvious
importance, the program received only \$8.6 million in funding for the
current fiscal year]{.underline}, which is little more than "decimal
dust," to use the words of Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).\[13\]

#### Reducing small arms stockpiles [solves the aff]{.underline}

**Peters 09** -- Rebecca; ("Small Arms: No Single Solution" UN
Chronicle. Vol. XLVI No. 1 & 2 2009. January 2009.
<https://unchronicle.un.org/article/small-arms-no-single-solution>)//GK

1\. **[REDUCING THE EXISTING STOCKPILE]{.underline}**

The [existing global small arms stockpile is huge]{.underline} \-- at
least 875 million guns, according to the Small Arms Survey in Geneva.
Less than 25 per cent of these are in the possession of armies, police
or other government agencies; the remaining three-quarters are in the
hands of civilians. Guns on earth outnumber cars by about 40 per cent.
How can we reduce this enormous pool of weapons?

Reducing the existing State stockpile. [The best place to start is with
**government arsenals**, which by nature are easier to identify and
affect than the diffuse civilian holdings.]{.underline} With large
amounts of weaponry concentrated in a few locations, [a focus on the
State stockpile is the quickest way to make a dent in the sheer number
of guns on the planet. Governments may consider large armouries to be
necessary for national defence, but they **overestimate their
need**]{.underline}: according to the Small Arms Survey, [38 per cent of
military small arms in government arsenals are **surplus to
requirements**. This represents not only a **large waste of
resources**]{.underline} (in buying the guns, recording them, storing,
maintaining and guarding them), [but also a **serious hazard to military
and civilian populations living near accumulations of surplus
weapons.**]{.underline} In addition to the physical danger of
explosions, [surplus stocks act as a **magnet for traffickers,
insurgents and criminals, often with tragic results.**]{.underline}

The [grave threat posed by surplus guns and ammunition has been formally
recognized by the UN small arms process.]{.underline} A UN Group of
Governmental Experts on surplus ammunition was established by the
General Assembly in late 2007, and disposal of surplus weapons was one
of the priority topics at the Third Biennial Meeting of States on Small
Arms and Light Weapons in 2008. The consistent advice is that
governments should systematically identify and destroy their surplus
stock.

### 2nc---at: ddr fails

#### The counterplan is key -- DDR programs remain [underfunded]{.underline} and [in need]{.underline} of assistance

**Hanson 07** -- Stephanie; associate director and coordinating editor
at CFR.org, the website of the Council on Foreign Relations.
("Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) in Africa"
Council on Foreign Relations. February 15, 2007.
<https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/disarmament-demobilization-and-reintegration-ddr-africa>)//GK

The proliferation of UN peacekeeping operations coincides with an
increase in UN-led programs to disarm and disband warring parties, as
well as reintegrate ex-combatants into civilian life. "Disarmament,
Demobilization, and Reintegration," or [DDR programs]{.underline} as
they are known to practitioners, [have featured in post-conflict
reconstruction from Afghanistan to Haiti.]{.underline} But the bulk of
DDR interventions---twenty-four since 1992---have occurred in Africa.
[The failure of early DDR programs in Somalia and Liberia, partly
attributed to their vague mandates, prompted a shift in recent years
toward more focused interventions]{.underline}, now codified in a new
set of policy guidelines developed in 2005. [Newer DDR programs in
Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, and the Democratic Republic of Congo have
disarmed hundreds of thousands of combatants]{.underline}, but [experts
say **these programs remain poorly funded**, and a lack of research has
**prevented practitioners from developing better reintegration
programs.**]{.underline}

#### Focusing on the ineffectiveness of DDR is [bad]{.underline} -- [progress]{.underline} has [been made]{.underline}

**Swarbrick 07** -- Peter; ("Avoiding Disarmament Failure: The Critical
Link in DDR" Small Arms Survey. February 2007.
<http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/F-Working-papers/SAS-WP5-DDR-Manual.pdf>)//GK

[Too much concentration on the]{.underline} everyday [difficulties and
complexities of a DDR process can]{.underline} sometimes [**obscure how
much real progress has been made** in an activity that]{.underline},
until quite recently, [did not form]{.underline} part of [the
traditional range of tasks performed by]{.underline} UN peacekeeping
operations or by [the international community]{.underline} in general.
And [though every DDR operation is different]{.underline}---and some,
like the DDRRR operation in the DRC, are more different than
others---[managers, donors, and practitioners are now]{.underline}
slowly [beginning]{.underline}, on the basis of the experience of the
past few years, [to see the emergence of common problems and **practical
solutions that can be applied in a wide variety** of apparently
dissimilar operations.]{.underline} It is hoped that this modest manual
might assist in this endeavour.

### 2nc---ddr solves

#### DDR solves conflict from arms in the short [and]{.underline} long term

[Efforts to assist the]{.underline} national [government in]{.underline}
some aspect of the DDR process will likely begin soon after the
conclusion of some form of peace agreement or settled ceasefire. If
pre-disarmament research into community needs, availability and movement
of small arms, and force composition and strengths has been conducted,
the design and planning of the disarmament process can be greatly
facilitated, and the voices of civil society actors can be fed into the
DDR design process. [The Sierra Leonean experience suggests that the
initial disarmament process should be concluded within approximately
**six months**, but full demobilization and reintegration will take a
long time,]{.underline} perhaps several years.

The [conduct of DDR programmes has been covered **in depth by several
organizations and research groups.** The World Bank, Small Arms Survey,
BICC, UNDP, UNIDIR and the OSCE]{.underline}---among many others---have
all [produced **best practices, lessons learned, case studies,
guidelines or other publications** to assist in the
process.]{.underline} A few points not often covered for project
managers, however, might be noted here.

### 2nc---ddr key

#### DDR is key to [security]{.underline} -- solves the affs impacts [better]{.underline} because it promotes long-term reforms

**Adinoyi 15** -- Julius Adavize; University of Nairobi. ("Importance of
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) in Post Conflict
Peacebuilding" Research Gate. November 2015.
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327861462_Importance_of_Disarmament_Demobilization_and_Reintegration_DDR_in_Post_Conflict_Peacebuilding>)//GK

[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration continues to play an
**important role** in peace and state building initiatives as it
**contributes to a secure environment required for long term
development**]{.underline}. It should also be borne in mind that [DDR is
**directly linked to opportunities for reforming the overall security
sector** in post-conflict situations and therefore]{.underline}, policy
makers should take into account this interdependence.

It is very important for those designing and implementing DDR programmes
to link those programmes to the wider sustainable peaceefforts,
including reforms in the security sector and development of the
socio-economic frameworks that the targeted national government and its
society can use to forestall any relapse into conflict. The [DDR
process]{.underline} therefore [contribute to the broader security
sector reforms that create an **enabling environment for the advancement
of formal education, the development of agriculture, the establishment
of small enterprise development**]{.underline} such as micro-businesses
and other income generating activities, the initiation of vocational
training and apprenticeship programmes, job placements, the promotion of
human rights and justice, the integration of fighting forces into
national armies, the facilitation of reconciliation and the building of
national unity.

Therefore it is evident that [DRR is important in post-conflict
situations]{.underline} to aid Security sector reforms; solves issues
surrounding female soldiers and dependents; disarmament of combatants;
psychosocial aspect of combatants and civilians involved in the
conflict; addressing human rights violations; economic reintegration
processes, and strengthening national capacity in all sectors of the
re-built nation. And while [DDR mechanisms]{.underline} and its
application [decreases violence and ushers long-term peace, increases
security through primarily reduced weapon and violence]{.underline};
there is need for stronger political willingness and sincerity of
worrying parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of DDR in
preventing the relapse of conflict.

### 2nc---solves---illicit trade

#### Buyback solves comparatively better than blocking sales -- shields black market tradeoff.

**[If less weapons equates to less crime, then why are there illegal
weapons markets, and what are these weapons used for?]{.underline}**
Some **[research finds that illegally procured arms have more
significant impacts on violent crime]{.underline}**. Researchers explain
that **[illegal guns are nearly impossible to track]{.underline}** (once
they enter the illegal pool), have further geographical reach, **[and
are used in homicides more often than their legal
counterparts]{.underline}**. In addition, **[introducing stricter
firearms laws (especially in states of close proximity) may increase the
likelihood that firearms will be sold and traded
illegally]{.underline}**. Kahane (2012) finds that, in the American
context, "federal and state laws restricting gun ownership for some
individuals have given rise to the illegal market for guns" (p. 631).
These **[illegal weapons]{.underline}**, in turn, **[are used to commit
various crimes]{.underline}**. By using the Incident Database from South
Carolina (1991-1994), Stolzenburg et al. (2000) find there is a
relationship between illegal gun availability and violent crimes, gun
crimes, and juvenile gun crimes.

Additionally, **[offenders of these crimes do not substitute knives for
guns]{.underline}**; implying **[those owning illegal firearms prefer to
use them during the commission of crimes]{.underline}**. In the United
States, guns are purchased in states with weak regulations and illegally
sold in states with strong regulations, and the closer two opposing
states are the more likely this trade occurs (Knight 2013). **[Thus if
the goal is to reduce violence, tougher regulations may paradoxically
increase the flow of illegal and illicit small arms, which in turn
increases the likelihood that these weapons will be used for
violence]{.underline}**. Because tighter weapons controls induce
black-market trading, regulatory efforts should occur in conjunction
with disarmament and firearms-reduction programs, which indicates that
there are considerable investments to be made if regulations are to be
taken seriously. Within the United Nations' policies, most of the
control is given to the state, and it is stipulated that legislative
measures should tighten lax gun laws (this generally is meant to target
weapons not meant for collecting or recreation). However, because
varying "community standards" exist and the views of firearms change
according to locality, Blocher (2013) concludes that local levels of
government should be the primary regulators of firearm controls.

Because rural communities emphasize gun culture, self-sufficiency, and
hunting more than their urban counterparts, weapons regulations should
account for these two fundamentally opposing views with reference to
firearms regulation. In sum, Blocher answers the regulatory question by
setting central guidelines, and delegating control procedures and
responsibilities to adapt to local standards. While this approach may
have favorable results in the case of the United States and other
western states, local institutions at the local level in developing
countries would most likely lack institutional longevity or credibility
to account for such variation. The solution of delegating responsibility
to the local level presupposes effective regulatory control across
locals, which is something that cannot be uniformly assumed.

**[If reducing weapons numbers reduces crime, then buyback programs
should reduce weapons numbers, and effectively reduce
crime]{.underline}**. While there is some evidence to suggest that
stricter controls on firearm ownership reduce crime, Phillips et al.
(2013) conduct a time series analysis, and find that the reduction of
weapons via buyback programs had little-to-no impact on violent crime in
the United States (and if there is an effect, it takes years to see the
results of such). This finding highlights important aspects of buyback
programs -- namely that most weapons collected are out of date,
non-functional, or are weapons that are typically not connected to
violent crimes (instead they are perhaps smaller caliber or sporting
weapons). The authors did, however, note that **[there was a successful
buyback campaign conducted in Australia where, in response to a massacre
that killed 35 people, legislative action was taken to collect 65,000
weapons in an effective buyback program. This implies that, for buyback
programs to maximize effectiveness, there must be collections of scale
in order to make any substantial impact]{.underline}**. These findings
have impacts for regional arms control policy and disarmament strategies
in post-conflict societies, and, drawing on this research and the modest
success of the "Toys for Guns" program in the Latin context, **[buyback
generally appear to require highly coordinated efforts or significant
capital investment to be effective]{.underline}**.

## Politics

### politics links -- NRA -- small arms

#### The NRA is [actively lobbying]{.underline} for global [arms sales]{.underline} -- it wants to [expand]{.underline} its market

**Volsky 19** -- Igor; executive director of Guns Down America. ("The
NRA is going global. Here's why." The Washington Post. March 28, 2019.
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/28/nra-is-going-global-heres-why/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.6648b0d25ab0>)//GK

[[The N]{.mark}ational [R]{.mark}ifle [A]{.mark}ssociation [is trying to
**export its guns-for-everyone-everywhere agenda
overseas**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and its global activities have
little to do with its mission to protect the constitutional rights of
gun owners.

This week, an investigation released by Al Jazeera showed how NRA
lobbyists advised politicians from Australia's far-right One Nation
party who sought to loosen the nation's gun-control measures and make
firearms more accessible. Among other recommendations, the NRA
representatives suggested shaming gun-control groups after mass
shootings and ghost-writing columns in local newspapers.

This was not an isolated incident. In fact, just [days after a gunman
killed 50 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, figures affiliated with
the NRA went into overdrive arguing that New Zealand's gun-control
measures led to the massacre.]{.underline} Twitter accounts began
tweeting the NRA's pro-gun propaganda at New Zealand lawmakers and
citizens, and the country's pro-gun lobbyIsts began parroting NRA
talking points.

Similarly, [at the end of 2016, prominent NRA-linked researchers
appeared before the Mexican Senate to **discuss bringing in more
firearms**, leading one Mexican newspaper to publish]{.underline} the
headline, ["The Mexican Senate Opens its Doors to the National Rifle
Association."]{.underline}

So [why would an organization]{.underline} that wraps itself in the
American flag and regularly attacks gun-control supporters for importing
"European-style" socialism into the United States [spend so much time
working with pro-gun politicians and advocates in places such as Brazil,
Australia, Russia and New Zealand]{.underline} --- all in an effort to
push those nations to loosen their gun laws?

The likely answer is that [**[the lobby is motivated to find new
international customers for American gun manufacturers]{.mark}** and
help foreign gun makers sell their firearms in the U.S. market. After
all, **it gets a cut.**]{.underline}

The United States is already the largest gun exporter in the world, with
firearm exports increasing over the past six years. A recent report from
the Center for American Progress concluded that U.S.-sourced guns "were
used to commit crimes in nearby countries approximately once every 31
minutes" between 2014 and 2016. And just [last month]{.underline},
partly [[at the NRA's behest]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[made it]{.mark} **even
[easier]{.mark}** [for U.S. weapons manufacturers to send]{.mark} their
[products overseas]{.mark} by imposing a less onerous licensing process
for exporters.]{.underline} The new system will also make it harder to
track how American weapons are used globally.

[As the NRA]{.underline} itself [admitted]{.underline} after the
administration's rules became public, [the goal of the measure is the
"promotion of American industry, innovation, and
competitiveness."]{.underline}

But [the self-proclaimed "oldest civil rights organization in the
country" is happy to cash in from foreign gun makers as
well.]{.underline} Almost one-third of all U.S. gun sales are imports,
and many [[foreign gun makers are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[producing
their firearms]{.underline}]{.mark} right here [[in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}

As Iain Overton, a gun-control activist in London, explained to
Bloomberg, "Europeans sell guns to the Americans that one isn't allowed
to have in Europe. \... People here see no irony in making guns here and
shipping them off to the U.S."

[For those manufacturers, **cultivating relationships with the American
gun lobby is paramount for business.**]{.underline} Who, after all, will
defend foreign gun manufacturers after their firearms are used in mass
shootings here in the United States and ensure that the market for
American customers remains unrestricted? The alleged killer at the
Pittsburgh synagogue in October relied on three Austrian Glock .357
handguns (along with a Colt AR-15 rifle). The shooter at Sandy Hook
Elementary School used a Glock 10mm handgun and a German SIG Sauer P226
9mm handgun as well as an American-made assault weapon to kill 26
people.

So it's no surprise that in 2008, Beretta, an Italian gun manufacturer,
pledged to donate \$1 million to the NRA. Belgian FN Herstal gave as
much as \$200,000 to the lobby in 2013. Glock donated at least \$115,000
during 2011, and both Glock and Beretta are part of the lobby's Golden
Ring of Freedom, an elite circle for donors that gift \$1 million or
more. SIG Sauer is also part of that club.

[Close financial [ties between the NRA and foreign gun makers
highlight]{.mark} just [how]{.mark} far [the NRA]{.mark} has
[evolved]{.mark}]{.underline} from an organization dedicated to
improving the marksmanship of Union soldiers [**[to a powerful]{.mark}
and sophisticated [lobby]{.mark}** dedicated to advancing the economic
interests of firearm manufacturers **all around the
world**.]{.underline} It also raises important questions about the
validity of its status as a tax-exempt social welfare organization that
is supposed to primarily serve the community interest.

the closure of retail firearm dealers and federal requirements for the
registration of all firearms]{.underline}**. While law enforcement and
military personnel are permitted to use firearms by Article 160 of the
country's federal criminal code, the Mexican army (SEDENA) oversees the
sale of all firearms to private individuals through the Federal Arms
Registry. **[Person-to-person firearm sales are prohibited by Article
164 of the criminal code]{.underline}**. .4 **[There are also
restrictions on the caliber of firearms that ordinary citizens may
possess, which is limited to 0.380 or less]{.underline}** (0.357 magnum
and 9 mm parabellum are also prohibited), **[and in practice the lawful
possession of firearms above 0.22 caliber is limited by the difficulty
of obtaining permits to do so]{.underline}**. Hunters and target
shooters may obtain licenses for firearm possession, and gun collecting
is allowed with some exceptions. **[As a result of these strict
controls, there were only about 4300 legally registered firearms in
private possession in the country in 2007]{.underline}** (Grillo, 2007).

### 1nc---illicit trade

#### Regulations don't check illicit trade -- its impossible to quantify the flow of arms to Mexico.

the SecDev Group, John H. Patterson is arguably the father of modern
American sales ("The Way of the Gun: Estimating Firearms Trafficking
across the US--Mexico Border", Journal of Economic Geography, June 2014)

On the other hand, **[despite]{.underline}** these **[strict
regulations]{.underline}**, **[there is a large volume of illegal
firearms in Mexico]{.underline}**. In fact, in 2012, **[the Mexican
military estimated that only one-third of 1% of firearms in Mexico is
legally registered, and 90% of all firearms are used for criminal
purposes]{.underline}**.5 The Mexican federal government has seized a
large number and wide array of arms in recent years (see Figure 3), with
dramatic growth in the proportion of high-powered weapons (including
9-mm pistols, 0.38-caliber 'super' pistols also known as cop killers,
0.45-caliber pistols, and AR-15 and AK-47-type assault rifles, grenades
and bazookas).6 The jump in seizures from 2007 to 2008 is likely due to
increased scrutiny of firearms trafficking by the Caldero´n
Administration, as well as more frequent raids on Drug Trafficking
Organizations (DTOs) that may be in possession of illegal firearms
(Goodman and Marizco, 2010, 175). **[US and Mexican authorities
recognize that a large quantity of firearms, ammunition and explosives
sold legally in USA are trafficked illegally into Mexico, primarily
through overland smuggling routes across the]{.underline}** 2000-mile
US--Mexico **[border]{.underline}** (Goodman and Marizco, 2010; Violence
Policy Center, 2009). ATF efforts to trace firearms provided in Mexico
have consistently found that an overwhelming proportion of firearms---as
high as 90%---came to Mexico from USA (Serrano, 2008).7 A 2007 ATF trace
of firearms confiscated in Mexico found that 1805 (73.5%) of 2455
firearms came from three of the four US border states: Arizona,
California and Texas (Marks, 2006). **[The accessibility of firearms in
the border region is facilitated by the existence of an estimated 6700
FFLs in the border region, which represent more than 12.5% of all
registered gun dealers in the country]{.underline}**. **[The total
volume of firearms traffic from USA to Mexico has both intrigued and
frustrated those seeking to quantify and lower it]{.underline}**. Two
types of figures are routinely examined with hopes of throwing light on
the trade's size: seizures by US authorities of firearms bought or
transported with the intention of being trafficked across the border;
and weapons seized by Mexican police and subsequetly traced back to a
purchase occurring in USA (Goodman and Marizco, 2010). Figure 4 is a
conceptual depiction of the relationship between various subsets of
firearms. As data presented in Figure 1, **[the total volume of firearms
for sale in the domestic market is taken to be total manufactured plus
total imported minus total exported]{.underline}** (M þ I X). Among
these, **[some quantity is purchased with the intention to
traffic]{.underline}**. Of that number, some subset of arms is recovered
by US law enforcement. Another, mutually exclusive, subset of trafficked
arms is recovered by Mexican authorities, along with firearms that were
acquired outside of USA.

Based on US prosecutions alone, **[4976 firearms were bought with the
intention to traffic them to Mexico in FY 2009]{.underline}**. **[This
number corresponds to the proportion of US purchased
firearms]{.underline}** (represented by gray box in Figure 4) **[covered
by horizontal stripes, and is much lower than the Mexican government's
reported number of seizures for the same year of 32,332]{.underline}**
(Goodman and Marizco, 2010, 170, 176), **[which corresponds to the
entirety of the diagonally striped box]{.underline}**. The Mexican
Government claims that of the approximately 75,000 firearms it seized
from 2007 to 2010, roughly 80% were from USA (Goodman and Marizco, 2010,
170). Those 20,000 or so firearms per year correspond to the portion of
overlap between the red and green boxes in Figure 4. **[Few explicit
attempts exist to estimate the total volume of arms purchased for
trafficking]{.underline}**. Goodman and Marizco (2010) have perhaps
conducted the most comprehensive study on the US--Mexico firearms
traffic, but even they limit their research to the types of firearms
most usually trafficked, how DTOs are using those firearms, the
principal methods for buying and transporting the weapons, etc. **[Any
attempt to estimate the total traffic from firearms seizures will suffer
from the obvious disadvantage of relying upon educated guesses of the
percentage of total traffic that the confiscations
represent]{.underline}**. Therefore, we have chosen to use FFLs to
retail firearms as a proxy indicator for demand, and attempt to isolate
the effect of purchasers intending to traffic firearms across the
US--Mexico border on that demand.

The [illicit trade in small arms and light weapons delivers a global
supply of weapons and ammunition to the demand of rogue state and
non-state actors.]{.underline} While arms do not create conflict, they
increase the intensity of violent conflict. The [illicit trafficking of
small arms contributes to irregular conflicts in the Middle East, a
region of persistent conflict and instability. The international
community has attempted to regulate the global supply of small arms
through]{.underline} non-binding [agreement and embargoes, but these
efforts have been ineffective in achieving the goal of preventing the
flow of weapons to criminal organizations, terrorists, and other
de-stabilizing non-state actors.]{.underline} This thesis systematically
examines the illicit small arms trade to identify points of
vulnerability. This study identifies a strategy to disrupt the flow of
arms to specific groups or states by countering arms brokers and the
networks of actors that brokers coordinate.

Because governments cannot lock up gun runners if their activities are
not criminal offenses, [the PoA requires that member states outlaw the
unauthorized manufacture, possession, stockpiling, and trade of small
arms and light weapons]{.underline}. Yet, [many countries still have not
criminalized some or all of the activities identified in the PoA. **Only
about three-quarters of UN member states have laws and procedures that
criminalize the illicit possession of small arms**, and only two-thirds
criminalize the illicit manufacture and trade of these
weapons]{.underline}.\[7\]

Stockpile Management and Security

[Proper management of national small arms stockpiles is]{.underline}
also [essential]{.underline} to curbing the illicit trade. Physical
security and stockpile management practices vary significantly from
country to country. Some governments go to great lengths to secure their
small arms and light weapons, while the control exercised by other
governments is tenuous at best.

[**Too little is known about many national practices** to systematically
assess progress in this area since 2001.]{.underline} Yet, anecdotal
evidence from the press, government officials and UN reports, and data
compiled by civil society suggest [there is still **much room for
improvement**. Since 2001, there have been several disturbing accounts
of egregiously poor practices and a steady stream of reported thefts and
diversions from government arsenals.]{.underline} Furthermore, the 2005
study found that only 99 governments have "standards and procedures for
the management and security of stockpiles," and only 64 claim that they
conduct "regular reviews of stocks."\[8\]

Hence, [global and regional efforts were intensified to **tackle small
arms proliferation** globally. At the first United Nations Conference on
the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons]{.underline} held in
New York from 9 to 20 July 2001, [states were reminded of the terrible
consequences of the proliferation of small arms]{.underline} in human
terms and, through a programme of action, called on governments to take
urgent measures to strengthen the monitoring and regulation of small
arms and light weapons, primarily at the national level.

[The first major intervention]{.underline} in the form of the UN's
Firearms Protocol, which [made illegal transfers of SALWs a
crime]{.underline}, was directed at addressing SALWs proliferation in a
holistic manner. It was designed to regulate and control the manufacture
and supply of firearms, their parts and components as well as
ammunition. [Other efforts include the United Nations Programme of
Action (UNPoA), the UN Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and
Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition (the
Firearms Protocol), the International Tracing Instrument (ITI), the
Nairobi Declaration for the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa, the
Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and
Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related
Materials and the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons.]{.underline}

A major [regional normative instrument on small arms in Africa is the
African Union Bamako Declaration, which evolved out of the need for a
Common African Position at the 2001 UN Conference.]{.underline}
Following a Ministerial Conference in Bamako in late 2000, the
declaration recommends the following actions by African states: Creation
of national coordinating agencies for small arms; Enhancement of
capacity of law enforcement and security agencies and officials,
including training and upgrading of equipment and resources; Destruction
of surplus and confiscated weapons; Development and implementation of
public awareness programmes; Conclusion of bilateral arrangements for
small arms control in common frontier zones.17

### 1nc---straw man

#### The plan doesn't end the flow of arms to Mexico -- straw man purchasers thump.

**McDougal & Topher 19** -- Topher, associate professor at the Joan B.
Kroc School of Peace Studies at the University of San Diego, Robert
Muggah is research director of the Igarape Institute and a principal of
the SecDev Group ("Why a \'Great Wall\' Won\'t Stop the Cross-Border Gun
Trade", America's Quarterly,
<https://www.americasquarterly.org/content/why-great-wall-wont-stop-cross-border-gun-trade>
//Kosack

That Mexico's drug cartels get their firepower from the United States is
no longer much of a mystery. **[Even President Donald Trump has
acknowledged that the U.S. should do more to curb the flow of arms
across its southern border.]{.underline}**

**[But Trump's plan to stop that flow --- at least as it pertains to the
construction of a "great wall" --- doesn't fully take into account the
market forces of the arms trade on both sides of the border. Any effort
to limit Mexican cartels' access to arms will first require policies
that more closely monitor legal sales in the United
States.]{.underline}**

Over the eight years that President Barack Obama was in office, the
price of firearms on the U.S. black market rose dramatically, due in
part to lobbying by the U.S. gun industry that drove demand. The rise
was so significant that by 2010 (and for the first time since the 1994
passage of the Assault Weapons Ban) the cost of black-market guns in the
U.S. exceeded the cost of buying the same weapons on the black market in
Mexico---where legal weapons are difficult to procure. Yet contrary to
what basic economics would predict, hundreds of thousands of guns
continued to flow from the U.S. to Mexico over that time.

**[The reason is that legal sales---made mostly through "straw man"
purchasers who are able to buy guns in the U.S. openly---account for the
majority of the weapons that land in cartel hands. In 2014, roughly 70
percent of all traceable illegal weapons recovered in Mexico were
tracked back to licensed U.S. vendors. Approximately four of 10 of these
weapons originated in Texas.]{.underline}**

**[Part of the problem is that the southward flow of firearms from the
U.S. to Mexico constitutes an economic boon for gun manufacturers and
retailers, and there are considerable financial incentives to maintain
the status quo.]{.underline}** A few years ago, the Igarapé Institute
estimated that 2.2 percent of all U.S. domestic firearms sales from
2010-2012 eventually made their way south of the border. That amounts to
an astonishing 212,887 firearms every year, equivalent to \$127 million
in income for U.S. gun sellers.

If the U.S. truly wishes to turn off the gun-trafficking tap, as Trump
has suggested, the administration must focus first on legal sales.
**[The solutions are widely known: universal background checks, a
comprehensive sales registry, and safeguards to limit straw
purchasers]{.underline}**. **[Even if broader consensus on gun policy in
the U.S. is hard to achieve, improving oversight of outbound traffic at
customs would go a long way toward limiting the flow of
arms.]{.underline}**

Granted, these measures are not without limitations. They are focused on
constraining supply, and in theory supply-side efforts in the face of
inelastic demand can lead to higher profit margins without reducing
total volume (the U.S. approach to the war on drugs comes to mind).

But there is some merit to supply-side approaches to reducing U.S.
weapons sales. First, guns are a unique product in that they create
their own demand. **[The more guns there are in a society, the more they
generate insecurity, and spur further demand. Thus, by making guns less
available through tougher regulations on legal purchases and
interdiction, demand can be reduced]{.underline}**. Second, supply-side
approaches to curbing firearms trafficking can have a radical effect on
cartels by virtue of the parts of the supply chain they target. Domestic
curbs on straw man purchases will, in effect, raise the price of
firearms for cartels and cut into their profits.

These common-sense solutions may be a hard sell in a polarized political
environment, but they are vitally important for Mexico. The country's
homicide rate is on the rise again after dropping from a peak of 23.5
per 100,000 people in 2011. Cities on the border have been hard hit.
Tijuana, for example, experienced the most violent year in its history
in 2016, with 910 registered homicides in a city of just 1.7 million
people. The proportion of homicides involving firearms has also been
steadily rising, from around 50 percent of all murders in the 1990s to
68 percent in 2011.

**[If Trump's wall (and accompanying electronic monitoring capacity)
could be linked with a U.S. domestic sales registry, any arms
interdicted at the border could be traced back to a lawful U.S. buyer,
who might then be prosecuted as a straw purchaser]{.underline}**. Such
integration could bolster domestic law enforcement efforts. **[But a
physical barrier on its own would have a negligible impact on arms
trafficking, both for the reasons above and because U.S.-Mexican
smuggling occurs between the cracks of two overburdened U.S.
bureaucracies. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is traditionally
focused on interdicting illegal inflows---not outflows---of people,
drugs and weapons.]{.underline}** As a result, Mexican authorities
consider the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives their
lead counterpart, even though that agency is ostensibly only responsible
for enforcing domestic laws.

Even assuming the unlikely case that wall-building along the border
succeeds in catching more gun traffickers, what then? **[If Mexican
cartels feel compelled to compete and defend themselves with weapons,
demand will persist.]{.underline}** As a result, profits will simply
rise for those trafficking syndicates that are able---by whatever
means---to deliver the goods.

The tricky question of U.S.-Mexico firearms trafficking needs to be
comprehensively addressed. A retreat to alternative facts will not help
save either American or Mexican lives. What is amply clear is that the
U.S. should have a strong sense of self-interest to ensure stability in
Mexico. And ensuring this security on the other side of the border will
require designing and enforcing much more responsible firearms policies
at home.

#### Straw purchasers thump -- they'll use vehicles to bring arms across the border.

**Martinez 19** -- Gabriela, journalist @ PBS ("The flow of guns from
the U.S. to Mexico is getting lost in the border debate", PBS News Hour,

So-called **["straw purchasers" play a key role in firearms trafficking
from the U.S. to Mexico and other points south]{.underline}**.
**[Typically "straw purchasers" are intermediary or middleman buyers who
purchase and execute all the paperwork required for a legal firearm
transaction on behalf of someone else]{.underline}**. These purchasers
are usually American citizens who adhere to U.S. gun laws, including
passing a background check or meeting other applicable federal and state
gun laws.

In many cases, "**[traffickers will run a ring of straw
buyers]{.underline}**," said Kristen Rand, the legislative director for
the Violence Policy Center. "**[The traffickers are exploiting the
background check system because they just find people who can have the
background check, and as long as they don't raise suspicion with the
dealer, then it's difficult to identify that this is
illegal.]{.underline}**"

Straw buyers also evade suspicion typically by avoiding buying guns in
bulk. Instead of going to stores and buying 20 or 40 guns at a time,
straw buyers often buy only one or two weapons, Rand said.

Once the guns are purchased, traffickers face the next challenge:
smuggling them across the border without getting caught. But traffickers
have ways to surmount this obstacle as well.

For starters, **[guns can be disassembled into many parts, making them
easier to hide]{.underline}**. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives, and Mexican government officials, have told the U.S.
Government Accountability Office that smuggling weapon parts often
limits bilateral collaboration to trace firearms, according to a 2016
GAO report that looks at U.S. efforts to combat gun trafficking.

**[A 2016 study by the Small Arms Survey]{.underline}**, an independent
research project that's part of the Graduate Institute of International
and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, **[found that the
majority of weapons trafficked from the U.S. into Mexico are smuggled
over land in vehicles]{.underline}**. **[The type of vehicles vary, as
well as the manner in which weapons are concealed, factors that further
complicate government efforts to stop the smuggling]{.underline}**, the
study noted.

Trafficking cases documented from 2009 and 2015 reveal the variety of
ways gun runners hide guns in vehicles.

"**[Trafficked weapons were hidden in every conceivable location,
including in the fuel tank, above the exhaust system, and under the
bumpers]{.underline}**," the study said.

#### Straw purchasers were hired by the government---they will continue to pop up

The investigation into a **[federal operation that allowed U.S. weapons
to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels escalated Thursday with
new revelations that an Arizona gun dealer repeatedly expressed fears
that his guns were falling into the \"hands of the bad guys\" but was
encouraged by federal agents to continue the sales.]{.underline}**

A **[series of emails released by congressional investigators makes
clear what has long been suspected: that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives encouraged U.S. gun dealers against their better
judgment to sell high-powered weapons to buyers they believed were
agents for the drug cartels.]{.underline}**

In at least one case, **[employees of one Arizona gun dealer videotaped
gun buyers \-- suspected \"straw purchasers\" who could legally buy the
guns]{.underline}**, though cartel members could not \-- exchanging
money with other people on the dealer\'s premises.

The aim of the ATF program, called Project Gunrunner, was to gather
intelligence on suspicious weapons sales and arrest high-ranking members
of gun trafficking chains.

In an eerily premonitory exchange, the gun dealer expressed fears that
his guns could be used against U.S. border agents.

\"I wanted to make sure that none of the firearms that were sold per our
conversation with you and various ATF agents could or would ever end up
south of the border or in the hands of the bad guys,\" the dealer, who
has not been named, wrote in June 2010 to the lead ATF case agent in
Phoenix, David Voth. \"I want to help ATF with its investigation but not
at the risk of agents\' safety, because I have some very close friends
that are U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern AZ.\"

**[Three guns sold to suspects as part of Project Gunrunner have been
linked to the deaths of two U.S. agents, one in the Mexican state of San
Luis Potosi and the other near the Mexican border in
Arizona.]{.underline}**

\"Not only were the ATF agents who later blew the whistle (on the
investigation) predicting that this operation would end in tragedy, so
were the gun dealers \-- even as ATF urged them to make the sales,\"
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said in a letter with the new emails to Attorney
General Eric Holder.

The Justice Department has denied that the ATF \"sanctioned\" or
\"otherwise knowingly allowed\" the sale of assault weapons to straw
purchasers.

The new emails appear to contradict that assertion**[. They also suggest
that the Arizona gun dealer was seeking assurances from the ATF and the
U.S. attorney\'s office that the company would not be held responsible
if someone got hurt with guns that ended up in the hands of gun
runners]{.underline}**

Voth, the ATF agent, wrote to the dealer: \"I understand that the
frequency with which some individuals under investigation by our office
have been purchasing firearms from your business has caused concerns for
you. \... However, if it helps put you at ease we (ATF) are continually
monitoring these suspects using a variety of investigative techniques
which I cannot go into (in) detail.\"

When news accounts last June reported that **[guns bought in the U.S.
were being found at Mexican crime scenes]{.underline}**, the dealer
again expressed concerns, calling the news reports \"disturbing.\"

On \"one or two\" occasions when the dealer\'s employees videotaped a
suspected straw purchaser exchanging money with another person, ATF
urged that the sale go forward, but the employees refused, Grassley
reported in his letter.

\"**[In light of this new evidence, the Justice Department\'s claim that
the ATF never knowingly sanctioned or allowed the sale of assault
weapons to straw purchasers is simply not credible,\" Grassley
wrote.]{.underline}**

**[Thousands of guns were sold to straw purchasers under Project
Gunrunner]{.underline}**. The ATF has conceded that at **[least 195 U.S.
firearms sold to suspected straw purchasers have been recovered in
Mexico, but agents have said thousands slipped outside ATF
oversight.]{.underline}**

Interestingly enough, there are studies that highlight how
**[environmental conditions and factors can result in security dilemmas
that contribute to the increased potential of gun-related
violence]{.underline}**. Shrira et al. (2013) find that **[societies
that are exposed to deadly disease and parasites]{.underline}** 39
**[are more prone to commit increased levels of violence]{.underline}**.
**[Because the existential threats in diseaseprone societies, in-group
interactions]{.underline}** (as opposed to interactions more broadly)
**[are emphasized and banding together with familiar faces is a common
defensive tactic]{.underline}**. **[This banding effect in turn
increases the fractionalization of society, which increases
ethno-centrist views and promotes xenophobia, which in turn dehumanizes
the out-groups]{.underline}**. **[This dehumanization increases chances
of violence in threatening environments]{.underline}** -- especially if
weapons are easily available. Thus the localization of arms policies,
legislation, punishment, and norms are a highly local matter, which is
why blanket policies are next to impossible in combating both firearm
violence and illegal weapons trading. The United Nations' agreements
from this perspective are justified in delegating responsibility to the
state level. Because small arms dynamics and associated issues are so
heavily localized, the imposition of top-down approaches are generally
considered to be ineffective in combatting locally rooted problems.

### 1nc---alt cause

#### Too many [alt causes]{.underline} to small arms -- other countries, older stockpiles, and the black market all [thump]{.underline}

**FAS 01** -- Federation of American Scientists. ("The Global Threat of
Small Arms and Light Weapons Primer" February 1, 2001.
<https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/primer.html>)//GK

Where are these guns coming from?

[**More than 70 states produce various light weapons** and
ammunition]{.underline}. Direct sales from weapons manufacturers to
foreign governments or private entities are a principal source of
supply. Such sales are usually regulated (that is, licensed for export)
by national governments. In 1996, for instance, the U.S. State
Departments licensed over \$470 million of light military weapons for
export. The Commerce Department, which has jurisdiction over
industry-direct sales of shotguns and police equipment, approved an
additional \$57 million of exports. While these amounts are small in the
context of the overall arms trade (estimated at some \$30 billion
annually), at \$100-300 per gun these figures represent enormous
quantities of weapons.

[Cold war-era surplus stocks are a]{.underline} second [major source of
light weapons supply]{.underline} today. In the past few years the U.S.
military has given away or sold at discount vast quantities of excess
assault rifles, carbines, .45 caliber pistols, machine guns and grenade
launchers. [**Germany, the Netherlands, the former Soviet republics and
several Eastern European countries** have been unloading surplus guns on
the world market.]{.underline}

Covert gun-running by governments to foreign governments or\--more
often\--insurgent groups is a third source of small/light arms
proliferation. Such policies are frought with danger, as evidenced by
the disastrous legacy of weapons shipped by the Soviet Union and United
States to combatants in Afghanistan, Angola and Central America. These
[weapons outlived the original purpose for which they were shipped and
have since been recycled to other conflicts or to bandits.]{.underline}

[**The black market is another major channel of supply**, where private
dealers knowingly violate the arms sales laws and policies of the
source, transit or recipient state for commercial gain.]{.underline}

half of this year. If this trend continues, by 2015 more than 16,000
total violent deaths are estimated (Aristegui, 2015). Some **[factors
such as migration, unemployment, poverty and the increasingly widespread
presence of drug trafficking in our environment have expressed the
complex nature of violent deaths]{.underline}**; **[diverse indicators'
socioeconomic, geospatial, and cultural vulnerability are multiple faces
of gender violence; complexity requires a multidimensional view of the
problem.]{.underline}** The different levels of gender violence like the
extreme expression, and homicidal violence are a matter of political and
public character (Soberón, Zurita, Ramírez, & Torres, 2000).
**[Identifying characteristics, magnitude and intensity of the problem
of violence against women is not easy, mainly because of lack of
political commitment and dialogue interinstitutional to generate
information systems that make the deaths and domestic violence evident;
documented difficulties, scarce resources and skills in the management
of statistical information of the institutions are related to the
topic]{.underline}** (Ortega-Canto, Munguia-Gil, Oliva-Peña, &
Rodriguez-Sosa, 2009).

In this research we start from **[the understanding of gender-based
violence as a social construction]{.underline}**, which now **[needs to
be analyzed and understood from different perspectives given the
influence that social, historical and ideological context exerted on
it]{.underline}**. Precisely the family is one of the contexts in which
violence occurs at an alarming rate, (Domenech et al., 2002). According
to reports from this author, all combinations are possible and the media
are responsible for providing evidence of it; parents against children,
partners against each other, brothers against brothers, and children
against parents; so it looks like a modern phenomenon when in fact it is
as old as the family itself problem. From the look of this author,
family violence should not only be understood as a recent social
problem, but it requires the analysis of a number of socio-historical
factors that family violence can be explained and seen also as a social
and political. In its conclusions it suggests that **[the discourses of
violence are related to specific times and methods and companies that
generate different values to define confrontations, situations,
interactions and cause]{.underline}**s. **[They are always intertwined
with other dimensions such as race, ethnicity or gender, forming a whole
of the defining features of a culture that can be highly or moderately
violence against women and other groups unprotected]{.underline}**.

**[Today, in a globalized world where many ways of being human coexist,
the multiplicity of possible interactions is very diverse; hence
contemporary societies are characterized by a large and complex
heterogeneity;]{.underline}** Carvallo (2006) suggested that **[one of
the greatest ethical, scientific and democratic challenges to the
process of inclusion and exclusion in theory, research and intervention
in interpersonal relationships, was faced]{.underline}**. All this leads
to the analysis about the social transformation of the various
institutions and at the same time the fact that many organizations seek
to achieve through its various institutions, law or science itself,
values such as freedom, justice and equality and the right to a safe and
dignified life.

## merida counterplan 

### 1nc---merida cp 

#### The United States federal government ought to implement the reforms outlined in the Merida 2.0 and;

#### Increase security cooperation with Mexican authorities;

#### Institute universal background checks on purchases from the US;

#### Increase enforcement regulations;

#### Establish a requirement to report sales; and

#### Increase prosecutions and penalties for straw purchasers.

#### The counterplan effectively revitalizes the original Merida Initiatives -- prevents gun violence and illicit trade.

Context: **[Identifying national and transnational criminal
organizations as a priority national security threat in Mexico and the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has been widely
supported in both countries since]{.underline}** at least
**[2006]{.underline}** when then-President Felipe Calderon declared war
on international criminal organization operating in Mexico and across
the hemisphere. **[While the "war on drugs" enjoyed successes over the
proceeding 11 years]{.underline}** -- most notably with the capture or
death of multiple criminal leaders and the weakening, or disappearance,
of several criminal networks - **[the overall criminal threat has
persisted]{.underline}**. As criminal leaders, or capos as they are
referred to in Mexico, have left the scene their criminal networks have
fractured and become unstable, often resulting in greater violence as
competition among criminal groups has increased. Furthermore,
**[criminal organizations have increasingly developed new business
models focusing more on territorial control and diversifying their
criminal activities to include illicit mining and trafficking in stolen
petroleum, and human smuggling to name a few]{.underline}**.

López Obrador: **[The new President has promised to change the
logic]{.underline}** of the war on drugs **[in three]{.underline}**
important **[ways]{.underline}**: **[1) by focusing on the underlying
economic drivers]{.underline}** (poverty and inequality) **[that
encourage ordinary Mexicans to participate in the illicit drug trade; 2)
by offering amnesty to a segment of those involved]{.underline}**;
**[and 3) moving away from a heavy reliance on the military for internal
security]{.underline}**. The new President has argued that providing
vulnerable populations with economic alternatives to the drug trade will
result in fewer people depending on illicit activities to survive.
Likewise, offering amnesty from prosecution to low level producers and
traffickers will provide incentives for them to leave the illicit drug
business thus allowing Mexican security forces to re-focus their efforts
on more serious crime and violent criminals. Finally, **[he has endorsed
the formation of a National Guard -- a specialized military force with
law enforcement training -- as a transitional step away from the
military's traditional counternarcotics role and a bridge towards a law
enforcement focused approach to fighting criminal
organizations]{.underline}**.

New Directions: **[Future policy should take]{.underline}** the
following **[into consideration]{.underline}**: **[a) The risks of
fragmentation]{.underline}**: There is a growing consensus that simply
pursuing the high valued targets is ineffective in dismantling criminal
networks, and can result in greater violence. **[Greater sophistication
in targeting and attacking the midlevel elements of a criminal
organization -- from logistics to finances -- is more effective and
could result]{.underline}** in **[less violence]{.underline}**.

**[b) Greater understanding of organized crime structures and business
models]{.underline}**: Organized criminal networks are not all alike.
Some operate across international boundaries; others are national, and
even locally focused. Some are specialized in logistics and
transportation, extortion, illicit drugs, or human smuggling; and some
deal in multiple criminal activities. Some are focused on control of a
particular territory, while others seek to control specific routes, port
cities, or cross-border ports of entry. **[Greater understanding of a
criminal organization's structure and business model can suggest better
strategies for dismantling the criminal network]{.underline}** rather
than simply imprisoning the capo. **[Measures of success]{.underline}**
should go beyond a simple counting of capos killed or captured and
**[should be based on reductions in violence and improved citizen
security]{.underline}**. **[Greater research and understanding of the
differing models and strategies of organized crime is
essential.]{.underline}**

**[c) Attacking criminal financing]{.underline}**: Billions of dollars
are laundered through the Mexican financial system annually that are
proceeds from drug, arms, and human trafficking, corruption, extortion,
and oil and fuel theft. **[The]{.underline}** Financial Action Task
Force (**[FATF]{.underline}**) **[reported]{.underline}** in January
2018 **[that Mexico faces a significant risk of money laundering from
activities associated with organized crime, corruption, and tax
evasion]{.underline}**. While Mexico has a solid legal framework, fewer
than 20 percent of all 2016 money laundering investigations led to
charges being filed. Moreover, from 2013 to 2016, 12,987 cases of
corruption were investigated, 1,744 judicial actions were carried out,
and only 51 convictions were rendered. In this context, a number of
steps should be considered.

Anti-money laundering efforts**[. Emphasize the importance
of]{.underline}** anti-money laundering (**[AML]{.underline}**)
**[measures to fight corruption]{.underline}** (President López
Obrador's top priority) **[as well as]{.underline}** transnational
organized crime (**[TCOs]{.underline}**). Exploit financial
intelligence. **[Exploit financial intelligence in law enforcement
operations against TCOs]{.underline}**. Target financiers.
**[Aggressively pursue top financiers of TCOs since their main objective
is to maximize profits and their financiers are difficult to
replace]{.underline}**. Adequate resources. **[Push for more dedicated
resources to investigate and prosecute financial crimes]{.underline}**.
Identify beneficial owners.

**[Strengthen measures identifying beneficial ownership in financial
transactions]{.underline}**. Improve coordination. **[Encourage improved
coordination among prosecutors]{.underline}** (particularly within
Mexico's Attorney General's office), **[the FIU, banking regulators, and
law enforcement agencies to increase the number of money laundering
convictions and deter criminal activity]{.underline}**.
Non-conviction-based forfeiture legislation. **[Advocate for the swift
passage of nonconviction-based forfeiture legislation]{.underline}**
(which has been pending Mexican Congressional approval for months);
**[this would allow law enforcement agencies to more easily seize
illicit proceeds]{.underline}**. Training and technical assistance**[.
Provide training and technical assistance for antimoney
laundering-related agencies and promote better interagency and
international cooperation and information sharing]{.underline}**.

**[d) Intelligence sharing]{.underline}**: **[Improved intelligence
sharing between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and Mexico has been a major success of the Merida Initiative to
date]{.underline}**. While intelligence sharing should be continued, two
important challenges remain: 1) Distrust among Mexican security and law
enforcement institutions makes sharing U.S. intelligence with Mexican
counterparts cumbersome and inefficient. Moving to a "task force"
approach with multiple Mexican agencies consuming intelligence
simultaneously and coordinating their actions may be a useful
alternative. 2) Plans to reorganize Mexico's civilian intelligence force
(CISEN) may create better criminal intelligence gathering and analysis,
but may weaken Mexico's overall intelligence capacity to address
concerns about international terrorism etc. (See Section II below on
reforms to CISEN.)

**[e) Drug policy reform]{.underline}**: President López Obrador has
suggested reform of the nation's drug laws must be considered, allowing
for the potential legalization and regulation of some illicit drugs and
amnesty for an unspecified segment of the illicit drug trade. These
reforms may be worth exploring, but they should not be viewed as a
solution to Mexico's crime and violence problems. Legalization and
regulation could have a potentially positive impact on crime and
violence only if they are accompanied by efforts to strengthen the rule
of law and improve regulatory capacity. **[Amnesties]{.underline}** can
be appropriate but **[must be targeted and balanced with the rights of
victims, especially victims of violence]{.underline}**.

**[f) Disrupting the flow of illegal firearms]{.underline}**:
**[Evidence suggests that Mexico is the main destination site for
U.S.-sourced firearms trafficked to the region]{.underline}**. From 2011
to 2016, of the 106,000 guns recovered by law enforcement agencies in
Mexico and submitted for tracing, **[70 percent were originally
purchased in the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Nearly
half of the U.S.-sourced guns recovered in Mexico are considered long
guns---semiautomatic rifles, such as the AK and AR variants. **[The
impact of gun trafficking to Mexico has been devastating]{.underline}**.
2017 and 2018 saw the highest number of intentional homicides in
Mexico's recorded history, and access to firearms is one important
factor contributing to the violence. During 1997, 15 percent of Mexico's
homicides were committed with a gun compared to 68 percent in 2017.
Furthermore, **[information from]{.underline}** Mexico's National Crime
Victimization Survey (**[ENVIPE]{.underline}**) **[indicates
tha]{.underline}**t, from 2013 to 2017, **[close to 25 million
robberies, or one every six seconds, were committed with a firearm, and
an estimated 500,000 extortions and 300,000 kidnappings were committed
with a firearm from 2013 to 2017.]{.underline}**

**[The United States can and should take multiple steps to reduce and
disrupt the illegal trafficking in firearms that impact Mexico in
particular]{.underline}**. **[Among these steps are: improve the amount
and kind of information shared with Mexican authorities about firearms
captured in Mexico and traced by ATF]{.underline}**; **[institute
universal background checks on all purchases in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates; **[enforce stricter
regulations on the purchase of long guns and semi-automatic firearms in
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates to **[reduce straw
purchases and increase enforcement]{.underline}**; **[establish a
requirement to report multiple sales for long guns to an individual and
short period of time]{.underline}**; **[reduce the high number of
firearms stolen each year]{.underline}**; and **[increase prosecutions
and penalties for straw purchasers, or third-party,
purchases.]{.underline}**

Additionally, there are several complementary actions the government of
Mexico can take to reduce the threats posed by firearms trafficking.
Among these are: **[Prioritize firearms seizures at the
border]{.underline}**. A more balanced approach to security and customs
enforcement would move beyond a narrow focus on drug seizures and would
include a greater emphasis on firearms seizures. **[Use federal agencies
to compile information about gun trafficking and gun
violence]{.underline}**. Better data is needed to fully understand the
problem of gun violence and gun trafficking in Mexico. Mexico's
Secretary of Public Health could develop datasets that include details
about gun homicides as well as gun injuries. **[INEGI could conduct
surveys or extend existing ones to gather information about gun
possession and gun movement within the country]{.underline}**.

**[Create an agency in charge of addressing gun trafficking and gun
violence.]{.underline}** At present, several Mexican government agencies
have a role to play in confiscating and securing illegal firearms,
resulting in overlapping and redundant responsibilities. By
**[establishing a primary agency responsible for this matter -- not
unlike the U.S. Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in
the United States - Mexico could cut down on redundancy and inefficiency
and improve performance.]{.underline}**

**[Increase oversight of legal firearm purchases for military and law
enforcement agencies]{.underline}**. Mexico imports more firearms from
the United States than any other country in Latin America. Yet, these
**[firearms are]{.underline}**, at times, **[diverted from Mexican
security agencies to criminal networks]{.underline}**. From 2006 to
2017, close to 20,000 **[firearms that had been sold to state and
federal police agencies were reported to SEDENA as lost or
stolen]{.underline}**.

### 2nc -- solves -- generic

#### The counterplan facilitates long term security cooperation, development, and underpins socioeconomic violence. 

**Beszterczey ND** -- Dora, research associate at the Council on Foreign
Relations ("Merida II: A New Phase in U.S.-Mexico Security Cooperation",
Americas Quarterly, date, <https://www.americasquarterly.org/node/1406>
//Kosack

The meeting laid the foundations for the second phase of **[the Merida
Initiative]{.underline}**. The first phase, **[launched in 2008, was
designed to spend \$1.12 billion to battle organized crime in
Mexico]{.underline}** through the provision of military hardware and
training for police officers, judges, prosecutors and public defenders.
**[However, as turf war violence escalated across a string of border
cities]{.underline}**, the 45,000 troops deployed onto Mexico's streets
increasingly became the visible face of **[Calderón's
strategy]{.underline}**---and **[frontloaded Merida with military
assistance.]{.underline}**

The growing list of allegations against the army---long Mexico's most
trusted institution---is undermining its credibility, and its
operational success. Troops are fielding tips, filtering intelligence,
searching safe houses and detaining and interrogating suspects---tasks
the military was never trained for. **[As]{.underline}** the wars
between drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), their **[allied
gangs]{.underline}**, **[and the army claim innocent
lives]{.underline}**, silence reporters, close businesses, and propel
families north of the border, **[Mexican public opinion is galvanizing
to demand an alternative strategy and many want the army out of the
picture]{.underline}**. According to a poll published last week, 59
percent of Mexicans believe the DTOs are winning the drug war. Only 21
percent believe the government is.

Endemic corruption in Mexico's police force mean that for the short term
at least, the military will remain the central actor in fighting the
DTOs on the ground. But **[Merida II aims to expand bilateral
cooperation beyond enhancing Mexico's military capacity and law
enforcement by incorporating initiatives to improve border surveillance
and address the social and economic factors that underpin the
violence]{.underline}**. The strategy is based on a four-pronged
approach:

1\) **[Disrupting the capacity of DTOs]{.underline}**

2\) **[Reforming and enhancing the capacity of Mexico's security and
justice institutions]{.underline}**

3\) **[Creating a twenty-first century border that advances commerce and
security]{.underline}**

4\) **[Building strong, resilient communities that tackle the drivers of
violence and defy the influence of the DTOs]{.underline}**

The first and second components aren't new, but **[there's a change in
the allocation of the \$310 million requested for 2011 away from
hardware.]{.underline}** After all, much of the hardware originally
included in the first phase of Merida will have been delivered by the
end of this year. Instead, **[the bulk of the new money will go toward
institutional strengthening with \$207 million of the total budget
supporting Mexico's judicial reforms and 'good
governance.']{.underline}**

**[Pilot projects]{.underline}** implemented at the local-level **[that
facilitate policy coordination and information sharing will also be
expanded]{.underline}**. These include DEA agents, the bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and FBI analysts working together and
sharing information with the Mexican military and federal police in
Ciudad Juarez, and the U.S. Border Patrol working with the Mexican
federal police in various localities.

**[To further aid intelligence sharing, the two governments are planning
a new hub]{.underline}** in Mexico City **[where]{.underline}** the
highest level **[law enforcement and intelligence agency representatives
from both countries will work]{.underline}** under the same roof **[to
coordinate interagency policy]{.underline}**, and review and develop new
agendas.

While the first two components are the key to tackling the operations of
drug traffickers, **[the new strategy recognizes that]{.underline}**, in
isolation, **[they fail to offer long-term economic and social
alternatives]{.underline}**. Without an eye to improving the
competitiveness of border states by integrating the two nations'
economies through modernized infrastructure, the U.S.-dependent Mexican
economy will struggle to recover. **[Without the promise of education
and professional opportunities, communities have little to offer youth
as an alternative to the social status gangs provide]{.underline}**.

**[The plan re-conceptualizes the way a dynamic border should
function]{.underline}**: **[new transport hubs will ensure speedy
crossings; pre-screening cargo at plants away from the border will
improve security and free up capacity at customs; GPS on pre-screened
trucks will deter deviation; and southbound]{.underline}** (not just
northbound) **[vehicles will undergo]{.underline}** increased
**[inspection]{.underline}** as a U.S. system for scanning license
plates with databases of stolen cars will be linked to Mexican customs.

To support the emergence of border communities resilient to the
penetration of organized crime, **[the U.S. will provide technical and
financial support to hinder the social and socioeconomic variables that
perpetuate violence]{.underline}**. The strategy is predominantly
focused on youth, who make up 70 percent of those killed in Ciudad
Juarez. There, the scene of one third of all drug-related murders in
Mexico, 40 percent of the city's youth are neither employed nor in
school, its maquila factories offer only low-wage labor, and unequal
access to education offers no prospect for social advancement. Under the
new agreement, **[federal, state and municipal-level interventions will
bring in urban planners to construct public spaces, launch job creation
programs, open new schools and expand university campuses, establish
scholarships to bring drop-outs back to school, raise funding for public
health, and create after-school, youth development and rehabilitation
programs]{.underline}**. (The strategy is reflected in the "We Are All
Juarez" campaign, unveiled in the aftermath of the January murder of
sixteen young people).

### 2nc -- solves -- relations

#### Maintaining specific & local reformation processes in Mexico sustains US relations.

**[In addition to the multiple proposals for new directions in the
bilateral security relationship discussed above, there are three
underlying principles that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Mexico should reaffirm as the
underpinnings of a healthy security relationship]{.underline}**:

We are in this together. **[The principles of shared responsibility and
bilateral collaboration are fundamentally important to successful
security cooperation]{.underline}**. **[Illicit
economies]{.underline}**, whether smuggling drugs, humans, or other
products**[, do not respect borders, so it is essential for both
countries to work together to address these complex
problems]{.underline}**. The United States and Mexico should reaffirm
their commitment to the framework of shared responsibility for
addressing the security challenges that threaten both countries.

**[Addressing the complex nature of crime and violence cannot be reduced
to one issue or one approach]{.underline}**. Law enforcement efforts,
prevention programs, and economic development initiatives all have a
role to play and should be undertaken in an integrated fashion.
**[Focusing on specific local challenges and rebuilding state capacity,
especially locally, can have a profound impact on the criminal landscape
and bring us a step closer to peace and prosperity.]{.underline}**

**[Sustainability is key]{.underline}**. Sustaining reforms is a major
challenge in the context of political transitions. **[Success requires a
sustained approach that transcends a particular
administration]{.underline}**. Each new government will rightly want to
reevaluate what has come before, and propose new strategies.
Nevertheless, **[institutional reforms]{.underline}**, including the
professionalization of police and prosecutors, **[require a long-term
approach since these reforms are profound and require a change in
culture and outlook]{.underline}**. To aid this process, **[it is
vitally important for reformers to build strong societal support for
reforms that can help guarantee the sustainability of such reforms
beyond a particular election]{.underline}**.

#### Military ties outweigh the rest of the relationship.

**[The relationship between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Mexican militaries remains strong
despite significant political fluctuations between both countries
related to immigration and trade]{.underline}**. **[Maintaining these
ties, deepening them, and focusing on]{.underline}** other regional and
global **[security challenges are vital to continued good security
cooperation between both countries and their militaries]{.underline}**.
Increasing the exchange of liaison officers in both countries,
continuing training exchanges, planning bilateral and multilateral
training exercises, and addressing regional and international security
challenges together are positive steps that should be maintained and
expanded.

**[The role of Mexico's military in law enforcement matters continues to
be controversial in Mexico]{.underline}**. A proposed legal reform that
would have redefined the military's role in public security was recently
struck down as unconstitutional by Mexico's Supreme Court of Justice**[.
Adopting a legal framework to ensure legal protections for both the
military and civilians is essential to ensuring there is a strong rule
of law framework in place that would guide and limit the military's
involvement in public security.]{.underline}**

Even more urgent is the professionalization of civilian law enforcement
institutions that render the military's role unnecessary.

Sustainability. **[An emphasis on the sustainability of institutional
reforms is essential at all levels of government]{.underline}**. This
may require committing to reform and implementation plans that extend
beyond each Administration's term. Additionally, **[improved data
collection and shared access to and understanding of available data
could improve the analysis of the security challenges
faced]{.underline}**. Finally, **[mobilizing public support for
sustaining reforms and increasing accountability are important vehicles
for building more resilient communities.]{.underline}**

### 2nc -- solves -- stability 

#### The counterplan solves Mexican instability -- public assistance, human rights protections, and bilateral cooperation.

**[It remains to be seen whether]{.underline}** López **[Obrador
will]{.underline}** live up to his promises of empowering the
downtrodden or whether he will yet **[turn out to be another Mexican
politician who raises hopes, only for the electorate to see its hopes
cru]{.underline}**shed. If that happens, under the best of circumstances
**[it could inoculate Mexico against embracing risky
populism]{.underline}**. Conversely, however, disappointment and
resentment could produce repercussions greater than the country
experienced at any time since the 1990s. **[Mexicans could come to
believe that the entire post-authoritarian political spectrum of
parties, politicians, and ideas has run its course without significant
improvements in their lives]{.underline}**. They may become susceptible
to ideas far more radical and authoritarian than AMLO.

Overall, **[there is no structural reason for the relationship between
an AMLO administration and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to become conflictual]{.underline}**.
Washington should support many of AMLO's goals even while disagreeing
with many of AMLO's methods. Rather than adopting an anti-AMLO policy,
**[Washington should adopt a principled policy of fostering
accountability, rule of law, transparency, and institution building in
Mexico.]{.underline}**

**[Many of these principles were anchored in the Merida Initiative and
Washington should persist with them]{.underline}**, though adjusting
them toward better outcomes and learning from what has worked and what
not. **[They include U.S. assistance in training Mexico's police forces,
judges, and prosecutors]{.underline}**. The United States should also
expand rule-of-law and law enforcement improvements at the sub-federal
level in Mexico, working directly with committed state and city
administrations.

The United States should equally support efforts to professionalize the
Mexican bureaucracy overall and assist with training and rollout of
programs that encourage merit-based appointments and build standards and
protocols. **[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[cannot unilaterally pursue such measures in and for
Mexico]{.underline}**---instead, the AMLO administration will need to
request continued U.S. assistance. **[But AMLO's anti-corruption thrust
provides important openings for U.S. institutional development
assistance, as does his public insistence on upholding and protecting
human rights in Mexico]{.underline}**.

**[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[should]{.underline}** take advantage of such declarations and
**[scrupulously promote such policies]{.underline}**. **[It should also
insist that its counterparts--- whether the Mexican police, military
forces, and eventually the National Guard---are held diligently and
transparently accountable for any human rights abuses]{.underline}**.
And Washington can do its part in advocating civil liberties protections
for Mexicans, including safety for journalists, the empowerment of a
vigilant and vibrant civil society, and respect for Mexico's Supreme
Court.

In some cases, **[advancing those long-term institution-building
measures may require that Washington tolerate divergence in
counternarcotics policies between Mexico and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. In particular, Mexico's leadership may decide
that the country's poppy fields won't be eradicated, and that Mexico may
no longer chase after some of the country's kingpins on Washington's
say-so. This should not be a debilitating problem: Some of these
policies have been not just ineffective but outright counterproductive.
**[Reinforcing Mexico's rule of law and the competence, functionality,
and integrity of its institutions will far more effectively help to
combat criminality in Mexico]{.underline}** and dangerous flows to the
United States than bringing down a particular kingpin. For that very
same reason, as well as basic equity and hence the legitimacy of
democracy, the United States should also support development efforts for
Mexico's marginalized populations and regions. Indeed,
**[in]{.underline}** collaboration with the **[previous
administrations]{.underline}**, **[Washington]{.underline}** has **[led
in implementing anti-crime, socio-economic measures in
Mexico]{.underline}**; and advocating such policies got the Calderón and
Peña Nieto administrations to focus on them as well. The López
**[Obrador]{.underline}** team **[has much to learn from those efforts
as it builds its own policies, and can cooperate with Washington in that
area.]{.underline}**

Such **[efforts to strengthen Mexico's social fabric are]{.underline}**
not only **[fundamental for the quality of democracy in
Mexico]{.underline}**, they have positive repercussions for the United
States. But once again, all such projects should be subjected to a
scrupulous public debate and systematic evaluation of their pros and
cons across many different policy domains. Often, there will be
difficult tradeoffs, but they should be made on the basis of
comprehensive analyses and transparency, requirements the United States
can stipulate in its cooperation with Mexico.

### 2nc -- solves -- violence

It should be noted that **[the government's economic and development
strategy for addressing crime does not include the more focused evidence
informed crime prevention and violence reduction programs that have
resulted in improvements in specific communities across
Mexico.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the López Obrador government has
discontinued the PRONAPRED office, and there does not appear to be plans
for a replacement.

New Directions: **[While fighting violent crime requires professional
and effective security forces, security forces alone will not bring an
end to the crime afflicting communities across Mexico]{.underline}**.
Likewise, **[economic investments to create jobs and opportunity are
important elements of a long-term strategy, but they do not address the
immediate crisis situations]{.underline}**. **[Specific investments in
targeted and evidenced based crime prevention and violence reduction
programs are also needed to strengthen the social fabric of communities
to build resilience]{.underline}**. Reviews of numerous field
experiences with crime and violence prevention programs suggest the
following learnings:

Implement programs supported by strong evidence of impact. Adapting
these experiences to the Mexican context is urgently needed, but **[the
lack of Mexican experiences should not be an obstacle of designing
programs and testing for impact]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}**
U.S. Agency for International Development (**[USAID]{.underline}**)
**[has important experience in developing evidenced based crime and
violence prevention programs in the region, so their role should be
enlarged.]{.underline}**

Develop better diagnoses of local programs and design tailored
solutions. Not all crime and violence problems are linked to national
organized crime or drug trafficking. The **[solutions should respond to
local problems and be tailor-made, starting at the municipal
level]{.underline}**. **[More research and local diagnoses are needed
for this purpose]{.underline}**. Target people and places. **[There is
evidence that crime and violence are concentrated in certain places and
perpetrated by a very small group of people. Solutions then should be
targeted at the highest risk individuals, behaviors, and
places]{.underline}** (e.g. focus on at-risk youth, develop tools to
identify those individuals and places).

Promote an evidence generation agenda**[. Programs should have a strong
design, informed by theory and evidence, and include an evaluation
strategy to generate evidence on what works and why in the Mexican
context]{.underline}**. Implementors, such as governments and NGOs,
should have the capacity to design solid programs (e.g. develop a theory
of change and indicators) and include an evaluation strategy.
Coordination principle. Crime and **[violence prevention policy involves
many actors, and]{.underline}** this **[requires greater coordination
efforts among them]{.underline}**, including law enforcement agencies.
**[One of the biggest mistakes that have been made in this field is to
think that crime and violence prevention does not include law
enforcement agencies, while they are a crucial actor in this
field.]{.underline}**

Conclusion. **[Prevention policies should be a priority in any security
plan but should be one part of a broader and comprehensive security
strategy, which should include institutional strengthening and reforms
for all levels of law enforcement institutions]{.underline}**.

### 2nc---security cooperation key

#### Resolving violence isn't one-size fits all -- local reforms are key to stop corruption.

A local approach. Finally, **[the public security problems Mexico faces
are increasingly localized and thus require a more decentralized and
locally focused approach]{.underline}**. See section III for additional
discussion on this matter. The transformation of Mexico's justice system
to an adversarial model is one of the most profound yet vexing of all
efforts to improve security in Mexico. After 10 years of reform, much
progress has been made while many challenges remain. Some of the
challenges faced include public perceptions that the reforms are
allowing accused criminals to evade justice. **[Much blame is placed on
weak prosecutors and/or judges who either lack the competencies
necessary to manage the new criminal justice system, or have already
become compromised by external and corrupting influences.]{.underline}**

Key institutional areas that need to be addressed as **[the reform
process]{.underline}** moves forward include: Formation of an
intra-governmental coordination body with authority and sufficient
resources to oversee the full implementation of the new adversarial
criminal justice system. Such a body (SETEC)3 existed during the 10-year
implementation phase for the new adversarial justice system. It
**[provides a possible model for improved coordination across the
federal government and between the three levels of
government.]{.underline}**

Address gaps in training, including continuing training throughout a
public servant's career. Additionally, develop **[effective procedures
and mechanisms to evaluate the outcomes of]{.underline}** the
**[training]{.underline}**. U.S. support for training in Mexico should
occur once these mechanisms are in place. **[High profile cases.
Progress by the justice system in addressing high profile cases such as
human rights violations and corruption cases. The recent formation of a
"truth commission" to reassess the Ayotzinapa case involving 42 missing
students is a good first step.]{.underline}**

Disappearances and strengthening forensic capacity. **[Strengthen the
judicial bodies responsible for searching for disappeared persons and
increasing forensic capacity to identify remains]{.underline}**.
Building and maintaining trust. Intelligence cooperation is based on
trust. **[Given the potential upheaval in Mexico's intelligence
community with the dismantling of CISEN, maintaining and reestablishing
trust should be a priority for both countries going
forward.]{.underline}**

Building criminal intelligence capacity. Intelligence gathering to
combat sophisticated criminal organizations should be a priority, and
better integrating this function into the SSP and the Federal Police
makes strategic sense. **[Intelligence gathering, analysis, and better
integrating these products in law enforcement strategies and operations
are urgently needed, so the reorganization of CISEN may have some
benefits on the crime front.]{.underline}**

**[to change the focus of the Merida Initiative, a regional pact aimed
at fighting drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organized
crime, to development programs aimed at job creation and halting forced

\"**[We want to change the Merida Initiative completely, because it

The regional security cooperation pact was crafted by former US

Central America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic fight drug trafficking
and other forms of transnational crime.

**[Since the launch of the Merida Initiative, the US has disbursed an

performance]{.underline}**. **[The State Department has pointed

national training standards for police, investigators, prosecutors, and

over drug production and trafficking, including synthetic opioids. They
also have expanded their involvement in oil theft, kidnapping,
extortion, and other crimes.

**[Mexico's]{.underline}** human rights record has been widely
criticized, as has the **[justice system's inability to address
corruption and impunity]{.underline}**. In 2018, 49 human rights
defenders and 9 journalists were killed. In the past, Mexico's attorney
general's office **[has failed to resolve those types of
killings]{.underline}**. Even the high-profile case of 43 students

### politics link -- Mexico

#### The NRA is [actively lobbying]{.underline} for Mexican arms sales

**Volsky 19** -- Igor; executive director of Guns Down America. ("The
NRA is going global. Here's why." The Washington Post. March 28, 2019.
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/28/nra-is-going-global-heres-why/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.6648b0d25ab0>)//GK

[[The N]{.mark}ational [R]{.mark}ifle [A]{.mark}ssociation [is trying to
**export its guns-for-everyone-everywhere agenda
overseas**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and its global activities have
little to do with its mission to protect the constitutional rights of
gun owners.

This week, an investigation released by Al Jazeera showed how NRA
lobbyists advised politicians from Australia's far-right One Nation
party who sought to loosen the nation's gun-control measures and make
firearms more accessible. Among other recommendations, the NRA
representatives suggested shaming gun-control groups after mass
shootings and ghost-writing columns in local newspapers.

This was not an isolated incident. In fact, just [days after a gunman
killed 50 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, figures affiliated with
the NRA went into overdrive arguing that New Zealand's gun-control
measures led to the massacre.]{.underline} Twitter accounts began
tweeting the NRA's pro-gun propaganda at New Zealand lawmakers and
citizens, and the country's pro-gun lobbyIsts began parroting NRA
talking points.

Similarly, [at the end of 2016, prominent [**NRA-linked researchers
appeared before the Mexican Senate to** **discuss bringing in more
firearms**]{.mark}, leading one Mexican newspaper to
publish]{.underline} the headline, ["The Mexican Senate Opens its Doors
to the National Rifle Association."]{.underline}

So [why would an organization]{.underline} that wraps itself in the
American flag and regularly attacks gun-control supporters for importing
"European-style" socialism into the United States [spend so much time
working with pro-gun politicians and advocates in places such as Brazil,
Australia, Russia and New Zealand]{.underline} --- all in an effort to
push those nations to loosen their gun laws?

The likely answer is that [**[the lobby is motivated to find]{.mark} new
[international customers for American gun manufacturers]{.mark}** and
help foreign gun makers sell their firearms in the U.S. market. After
all, **it gets a cut.**]{.underline}

The United States is already the largest gun exporter in the world, with
firearm exports increasing over the past six years. A recent report from
the Center for American Progress concluded that U.S.-sourced guns "were
used to commit crimes in nearby countries approximately once every 31
minutes" between 2014 and 2016. And just [last month]{.underline},
partly [[at the NRA's behest]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[made it]{.mark} **even
[easier]{.mark}** [for U.S. weapons manufacturers to send]{.mark} their
[products overseas]{.mark} by imposing a less onerous licensing process
for exporters.]{.underline} The new system will also make it harder to
track how American weapons are used globally.

[As the NRA]{.underline} itself [admitted]{.underline} after the
administration's rules became public, [the goal of the measure is the
"promotion of American industry, innovation, and
competitiveness."]{.underline}

But [the self-proclaimed "oldest civil rights organization in the
country" is happy to cash in from foreign gun makers as
well.]{.underline} Almost one-third of all U.S. gun sales are imports,
and many [[foreign gun makers are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[producing
their firearms]{.underline}]{.mark} right here [[in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}

As Iain Overton, a gun-control activist in London, explained to
Bloomberg, "Europeans sell guns to the Americans that one isn't allowed
to have in Europe. \... People here see no irony in making guns here and
shipping them off to the U.S."

[For those manufacturers, **cultivating relationships with the American
gun lobby is paramount for business.**]{.underline} Who, after all, will
defend foreign gun manufacturers after their firearms are used in mass
shootings here in the United States and ensure that the market for
American customers remains unrestricted? The alleged killer at the
Pittsburgh synagogue in October relied on three Austrian Glock .357
handguns (along with a Colt AR-15 rifle). The shooter at Sandy Hook
Elementary School used a Glock 10mm handgun and a German SIG Sauer P226
9mm handgun as well as an American-made assault weapon to kill 26
people.

So it's no surprise that in 2008, Beretta, an Italian gun manufacturer,
pledged to donate \$1 million to the NRA. Belgian FN Herstal gave as
much as \$200,000 to the lobby in 2013. Glock donated at least \$115,000
during 2011, and both Glock and Beretta are part of the lobby's Golden
Ring of Freedom, an elite circle for donors that gift \$1 million or
more. SIG Sauer is also part of that club.

[Close financial [ties between the NRA and foreign gun makers
highlight]{.mark} just [how]{.mark} far [the NRA]{.mark} has
[evolved]{.mark}]{.underline} from an organization dedicated to
improving the marksmanship of Union soldiers [**[to a powerful]{.mark}
and sophisticated [lobby]{.mark}** dedicated to advancing the economic
interests of firearm manufacturers **all around the
world**.]{.underline} It also raises important questions about the
validity of its status as a tax-exempt social welfare organization that
is supposed to primarily serve the community interest.

JLP: There's a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that
says [they were not collaborating effectively.]{.underline} I don't know

permanent director]{.underline} for years, the resources and the
legislation. [The fact that international gun trafficking **has not been
a federal crime in itself** is also an indicator of the lack of
resources that the agency has.]{.underline}

The National Rifle Association (NRA) will be at the center of this
debate. Though widely considered one of the most powerful lobby groups
in the U.S., [the [NRA's impact on firearms policies extends]{.mark}
**far [beyond U.S. borders]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Not only has the NRA blocked or reversed efforts to strengthen gun laws
in the U.S., [[it]{.mark} has also [worked to **oppose international
efforts to combat** ]{.mark}**the [illicit trade in
firearms]{.mark}**]{.underline} at forums such as the United Nations,
[arguing that these measures would trample U.S. rights. It]{.underline}
has also [engaged in policy advocacy in other countries, working against
efforts to strengthen domestic firearms laws]{.underline} through a
variety of means, believing that working internationally can help
prevent global trends that could influence the U.S. debate. [Although
the NRA charter forbids it from spending money abroad, the organization
works around this to provide resources and **exert influence in many
ways**]{.underline}, including working with local gun lobby groups to
develop their capacity to fight gun control legislation.

[**The [NRA's international lobbying activities make it a]{.mark} de
facto [ally of U.S. arms manufacturers]{.mark}**[---the]{.mark} world's
[largest exporters of **small arms**]{.mark}]{.underline}---with U.S.
exports totaling \$706 million in 2009.1 Contributions and
[[sponsorships]{.mark} from gunmakers have [helped make it one of the
**most well-funded political lobbies in the U.S**]{.mark}., which, in
turn, **gives it a strong voice in both domestic and international
firearms debates.**]{.underline} In 2010 alone, the NRA spent more than
\$243 million overall---80 times more than the largest pro--gun control
group in the U.S., the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which spent
just \$3 million.2

Although some of its income comes from membership dues (the organization
claims to have 4.5 million members), [a significant portion of NRA
revenue comes directly from the firearms industry, which contributes to
the group in a variety of ways.]{.underline} The NRA's Ring of Fire
Corporate Partners Program has tiered incentives for business donors and
has provided an estimated \$20 million to \$52 million in funding
between 2005 and 2010. Industry advertising in NRA publications is
another significant source of revenue, representing \$20.9 million in
2010. Some gun manufacturers even subsidize the group directly, either
by purchasing NRA memberships for their customers or by providing the
NRA with a portion of revenues.3

#### The NRA is focused on [foreign markets]{.underline} 

This is [really helpful]{.underline} bc when they say NRA losing
influence in 2ac we can say that's why this link is so massive -- they
are refocusing to foreign markets do thrive despite mass shooting

His victory shows that [a core NRA principle---that armed citizens are
safe citizens---is **gaining political and popular traction far beyond
America's shores**.]{.underline} Founded 148 years ago in New York by
two Union Army vets to promote marksmanship, the group describes itself
as the "oldest civil rights organization in America." Its public events
and messaging are often draped in the Stars and Stripes. Yet for all the
patriotic symbolism, many of the forces shaping the NRA these days are
distinctly non-American.

[Gun control advocates]{.underline} have long [said the NRA is more
concerned with the needs of gunmakers than those of gun
owners.]{.underline} (The NRA didn't respond to multiple requests for
comment.) Lately, [foreign backers---and **foreign markets**---**have
become much more important to the NRA**. Imports have accounted for
almost **1 in 3 U.S. gun sales**]{.underline} in recent years, up from 1
in 5 less than two decades ago. Many foreign and [multinational gun
companies have opened manufacturing facilities in the U.S., taking
advantage of the lucrative civilian market]{.underline} and relatively
lax regulation, making them natural allies with the NRA.

[U.S. gunmakers]{.underline}, in turn, [**have set their sights

## African Stability

### alt cause -- 8 reasons

#### Instability in Nigeria is [inevitable]{.underline} -- 8 different reasons 

-be careful not to read this with the terrorism turn, probably takes
that out

**Umana 18** -- Kubiat; ("Causes of Conflicts and Political Instability
in Nigeria" Research Cyber. August 19, 2018.
<https://researchcyber.com/causes-conflicts-political-instability-nigeria/>)//GK

[Nigeria's political instability is]{.underline} conventionally
[attributed to the manner]{.underline} in which [leaders sustain
themselves]{.underline} in power. [Leaders across the country hold onto
office by **purchasing support** through the distribution of state
resources]{.underline}; as such, any conflict over their allocation is
thought to degenerate into a struggle over control of the state.

It is only natural that [where there is inequality]{.underline} in
access to the control of natural resources and political power for
instance, [there would be discontent, opposition and
controversy]{.underline} Nigeria as a heterogeneous society in terms of
ethnic, religious and cultural pluralism is prone to conflicts.

The giant was brought to its knees by 20 years of brutal and corrupt
military rule, which left a legacy of executive dominance and a
political corruption in the hands of Nigeria's so-called "godfathers" --
powerful political bosses sitting atop vast patronage networks who view
the government primarily through the lens of their own personal
enrichment.

**[1. Ethnicity]{.underline}**

In Nigeria (as in many parts of Africa), [political
conflict]{.underline}s often [**have ethnic coloration.** Ethnicity has
been used in Nigeria in terms of mobilization by political failures
lacking tangible agenda]{.underline} for the country, [and for seeking
economic power.]{.underline} When a politician fails to 'eat' he or she
will probably run to his "tribe" claiming that they are being finished
and this works on their psychology, thereby causing conflicts.

[Unpatriotic leaders use ethnicity to organize people for political
action pretentiously to **'defend' ethnic interests.**]{.underline}
Ethnic consciousness is a product of contradictions embodied in
political relations of structured inequality common in Nigeria. A good
example of this happened in the Nigerian-Biafra civil war Of 1967.

**[2. Military Involvement in Politics]{.underline}**

[Nigeria's political instability could be traced to the frequent
military involvement in politics]{.underline} since January 15th, 1966.
The [Armed forces have failed to maintain peace]{.underline} and
tranquillity as their professional calling. Instead of defending the
territorial integrity of the nation[, the military struggled for
political control of the nation.]{.underline} The unhealthy intense
struggle for political power within the political class and the military
hierarchy on one hand and between the civilian and the soldiers on the
other is indicative of an unstable political system in the country. The
reality is that the Nigerian military has become an estate of the
Nigerian realm. [Military involvement in the political lives of any
state introduces instability in its political structure and subsequently
brings down the economy to its knees.]{.underline}

**[3. Leadership Failure]{.underline}**

Nigeria's political [instability]{.underline} and other related problems
[are a consequence of its leadership crises. Nigerian governments are
run in ways]{.underline} that have been [regarded as far from the modern
western state systems]{.underline} upon which they are modelled. The
leadership pattern in Nigeria lacks the necessary focus capable of
instilling national development and promotes political stability.
Rather, [Nigerian leaders are **preoccupied with their desires for the
appropriation and privatization of the Nigerian state**.]{.underline}

**[4. Interests of the International Community]{.underline}**

Political instability in Nigeria owe much of its cause to internal
factors, however the [interplay of internal and external factors
especially geo-political and economic interests of the international
community constantly **play a significant role in
undermining**]{.underline} the very processes and **[institutions that
are expected to nurture democracy]{.underline}** and to instill a sense
of stability for societal development in Nigeria.

In combination to such factors as unequal development, poverty, disease,
violence and the manipulative tendencies of the local elite, political
and economic stability in Nigeria is constantly under threat. This
threat is however not emanating from within the country; but, from
external interests whose thirst for Nigerian resources, continue to
shape the dynamics in areas related to governance.

**[5. Issue of Money and Politics in Nigeria]{.underline}**

Another root of political instability is the issue of money and politics
in Nigeria. In a civilized society, money is not a determining factor
for elective post. No wonder, former President of the United States,
Bill [Clinton once said that the problem with Nigerians is that when
they want money, they go into politics]{.underline}, but in America when
the people want to make money they go into business.

**[6. Poorly trained Security Personnel]{.underline}**

The Police and other security outfits have not been adequately trained
to manage crises. The use of police and other security outfits has left
much to be desired. In most cases, the [rioters are "too hot" for the
untrained and unsophisticated police to handle in times of violence
outbreak.]{.underline} The rioters are well equipped and carry
sophisticated firearms.

**[7. Inefficiency in the Nation's Legal System]{.underline}**

Another reason why conflict persists and keep-on-reoccurring in the
country is that the [master minds, which instigate, mobilize, sponsor
and even arm the rioters, are allowed to go scot-free. They are **never
prosecuted or tried in any law court**]{.underline}, and if found guilty
sentenced to a long prison. Some of the people, who sponsor violent
conflicts, are the elites and powerful members of the society. The
feeling is that these people are untouchables and their followers see
them as such. Many of these masterminds go back to plan subsequent
rounds of such conflicts and violence, since they are never been brought
to book for their heinous crimes.

**[8. Non-adherence to Basic Democratic Tenets]{.underline}**

One of [the major factors responsible for political instability is the
failure of the political class to sufficiently adhere to the basic
tenets of democracy and constitutionalism. This]{.underline} situation
[has given rise to abuse of power, brazen corruption, disregard for due
process and the rule of law, intolerance of political opposition, abuse
of the electoral process and the weakening of institutions.]{.underline}

### turn -- African stability 

#### US [arms sales]{.underline} to Nigeria are key to combat [Boko Haram]{.underline} -- otherwise African stability [collapses]{.underline}

[In]{.underline} December [2015, Nigeria]{.underline} triumphantly
[announced it "technically defeated" Boko Haram]{.underline}, declaring
victory against one of the world's most brutal violent extremist
organizations (VEO).\[1\] [In 2018, [Boko Haram continues to incite
terror]{.mark} through **high profile kidnappings and deadly bombings
across Nigeria**]{.underline} and the Lake Chad Region. Yet, the message
remains the same, the latest installment coming in February from the
Nigerian Army Theater Commander who avowed Boko Haram is now "completely
defeated" after coalition forces drove them out of Sambisa Forest once
again.\[2\] If the recent surge in gray zone conflict literature
underscores one thing, it is that [the definition of victory is
**fleeting** against a threat specializing in ambiguity.]{.underline}

Despite a multitude of victory sound bites, research from BBC Monitoring
indicates [Boko Haram's attacks have just as frequent and deadly over
the past two years.]{.underline}\[3\] [Boko Haram continues to pose a
significant challenge to sovereignty in Nigeria and]{.underline}
therefore **[a threat to U.S. national interests]{.underline}**. Instead
of expecting more from the same approach, [it is time [to update the
counter-Boko Haram strategy]{.mark}. The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[can revitalize]{.mark} the [strategy **by increasing
f**]{.mark}**oreign [m]{.mark}ilitary [s]{.mark}ales**]{.underline};
enhancing the security forces assistance (SFA) mission to include
aviation training and nonlethal effects focused on information,
electronic warfare, and cyber support; and incentivizing disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts in Nigeria.

WHY NIGERIA MATTERS

[[**Africa is a critical geostrategic priority** for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates due to its sustained economic growth, abundant natural
resources, and growing entrepreneur class.]{.underline}\[4\] [Within
Africa, [Nigeria is]{.mark}]{.underline}, relatively speaking, [**[a
super-power]{.mark}**---the largest economy, the largest producer of
oil, and the most populated.]{.underline}\[5\] Economically, [Nigeria
runs a trade surplus with the United States]{.underline} importing over
\$5.5 billion in U.S. goods annually.\[6\] Despite experiencing a slight
recession in 2016 for the first time in two decades, the Nigerian
economy continues to recover thanks to gross domestic product growth in
2017 and even better estimates for 2018.\[7\] Recently, much of the
recovery is anchored by increased oil and natural gas production, along
with higher petroleum prices. [Though abundant in many natural
resources, oil and natural gas are the country's mainstays. **Nigeria is
Africa's largest petroleum producer**]{.underline}, 12th largest in the
world, and boasts the largest natural gas reserves on the
continent.\[8\] Astoundingly, [Nigeria is also the world's fourth
largest democracy, and the population is projected to surpass that of
the United States]{.underline} before 2050---Nigeria is on track to
become the third largest country in the world in just over three
decades.\[9\] [As the **beacon of Africa,** **the long-term
[stability]{.mark}** and economic growth **[of Nigeria is inextricably
linked to the continent's future]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

CONTINUING CHALLENGES TO SOVEREIGNTY

[Since the [Boko Haram]{.mark} insurgency began]{.underline} in earnest
in 2009, it [continues to serve as a credible challenge to sovereignty
in Nigeria]{.underline} and other states in the the region. [Their
stated [goal is to **overthrow**]{.mark} **the [Nigeria]{.mark}n
government**]{.underline} and replace it with a religious state.\[10\]
Accordingly, the U.S. Department of State officially designated Boko
Haram a Foreign Terrorist Organization on November 14, 2013.\[11\] The
[[violence perpetrated by Boko Haram is]{.mark} responsible for
[generating a **humanitarian emergency**]{.mark}, **displacing over two
million people** and creating a **food crisis for an additional eight
million**.\[]{.underline}12\] The humanitarian and refugee
[crisis]{.underline} also [creates regional challenges to
sovereignty]{.underline} throughout the Lake Chad Region, to include
Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. These nations are unable to control their
borders, quell cross-border violence, or support the influx of displaced
persons due to already-severe humanitarian situations within their
territories. Complicating matters, [[Boko Haram factions
are]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[aligning with]{.underline}]{.mark}**
I~~slamic~~ S~~tate~~ **[[factions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, giving way to
new streams of manning and resources for both groups.\[13\] [[The
result]{.mark} is [a]{.mark} distressed [region **in dire need of
assistance**]{.mark} **to address the Boko Haram challenge to
sovereignty.**]{.underline}

Security " Atlantic Council -- Africa Center. May 2017.
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Why_Africa_Matters_to_US_National_Security_0524_web.pdf>)//GK

[The United States cannot afford to underinvest in Africa]{.underline},
a continent of over a billion people with growing political and economic
power. And yet, [there is a **persistent misconception**]{.underline}
prevalent among the American public---and even many foreign policy
professionals---[that Africa is largely irrelevant to US national
security.]{.underline}

This is dangerous, for three reasons.

First, **[transnational threats from Africa are persistent and
real.]{.underline}** The continent's uneven democratic and economic
growth and pockets of conflict contribute to a disproportionate number
of weak and failed states, which [threaten US interests at home and
abroad by **opening the door to terrorism, criminal activity, and
pandemics.**]{.underline} For example, [the Islamic State]{.underline}
of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and other [groups are expanding their reach
across Africa]{.underline}1 and, but for a swift global response, the
Ebola crisis of 2014 to 2016 could have caused well over a million
deaths and vast economic harm.

Second, economic and political needs will inevitably draw the United
States to Africa. Though the continent is currently underrepresented in
the global economy, that will not last forever. Africa boasts a growing
middle class and, by 2050, will constitute a quarter of the world's
population.2 While US businesses are underinvested in African markets,
China and other global competitors are making deep economic inroads that
are feeding jobs in their own countries and creating economic ties that
translate into greater political influence. Though not always a zero-sum
calculus, [China's deepening ties to the region will undoubtedly reduce
US influence.]{.underline} Moreover, [African states are forming an
increasingly unified voice and salient voting bloc on global
issues]{.underline}, particularly in multilateral fora; these
developments could help either advance or block key aspects of the
United States' global agenda on issues ranging from counterterrorism to
nuclear security.

Third, [incidences of conflict, humanitarian crisis, and mass
atrocities]{.underline} in Africa **[put significant pressure on the
United]{.underline} States to act**, in fulfillment of the nation's
historic global leadership role. Though some question the value of
maintaining the United States' role as "global policeman," [military and
counterterrorism strategists staunchly agree that, in today's complex
and dangerous global environment, it is **insufficient to merely keep
Americans safe on American soil**.]{.underline} Indeed, the rationale
for promoting stability and development goes much further; it gets to
how the United States has traditionally seen itself in the world, by
promoting leadership and values that advance human dignity.3

Serious [engagement in Africa is needed]{.underline}, even [if one's
view of US national security imperatives is limited to **countering
transnational threats**]{.underline}. The logic is simple:
**[instability breeds threats]{.underline}**, and unilateralism breeds
failure. More to the point, advancing the stability and partnerships
needed to protect Americans ultimately requires promoting local
economies, supporting good governance, and addressing conflict in
African countries.

## Relations

[**underscores the deepening U.S. involvement** in helping governments

U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Franken, a deputy commander of the
Pentagon's Africa Command, told a Washington forum last week that there
now are 6,200 U.S. troops - most of them Special Operations Forces -
operating from 26 locations on the continent.

"[The Buhari administration]{.underline} I think has really
[**reenergized the bilateral relationship** in a fundamental
way]{.underline}," one U.S. official said.

The previous Nigerian government of Goodluck [Jonathan]{.underline} had
[scorned the United States for blocking arms sales]{.underline} partly
because of human rights concerns. It also criticized Washington for
failing to speed the sharing of intelligence.

[The souring **relations hit a low** at the end of 2014 **when U.S.
military training of Nigerian forces was abruptly halted.**]{.underline}

[That is changing under Buhari, whose crackdown on corruption has led to
a raft of charges against top national security officials in the
previous government.]{.underline}

**BBC News 14** -- ("Boko Haram crisis: Nigeria fury over US arms

There is no use giving us the type of support that enables us to deliver
light jabs

Adebowale Ibidapo Adefuye, Nigerian ambassador to the US

The attack has highlighted the depth of the crisis escalating in the
north-east, the BBC\'s Nigeria correspondent Will Ross reports.

But the politicians of all parties appear more focused on the pursuit of
power in oil-rich Nigeria and that is playing right into the hands of
Boko Haram, he says.

\'Rumours\'

Government soldiers have been accused by rights groups of carrying out
many atrocities, including torturing and executing suspects.

US laws ban the sale of lethal weapons to countries whose military are
accused of gross human rights abuses.

But Mr [Adefuye said the accusations **were based on \"half-truths\",**
rumours and exaggerated accounts, which were being spread by political
opponents ahead of the elections.]{.underline}

\"The US government has up till today refused to grant Nigeria\'s
request to purchase lethal equipment that would have brought down the
terrorists within a short time,\'\' Mr Adefuye told members of the New
York-based Council on Foreign Relations.

\"[We find it difficult to understand how and why, in spite of the US
presence in Nigeria with their sophisticated military technology, Boko
Haram should be expanding]{.underline} and becoming more deadly,\'\' he
added.

Soldiers say they are poorly equipped to fight the militants

Mr Adefuye said Boko Haram was Nigeria\'s equivalent of the Islamic
State group, and threatened the nation\'s \"territorial integrity\".

\"There is no use giving us the type of support that enables us to
deliver light jabs to the terrorists when what we need to give them is
the killer punch,\" he said.

[\"A friend in need is a friend indeed. The **true test of friendship is
in times of adversity**,\" he added.]{.underline}

Successive [Administrations]{.underline} have [described the U.S.
relationship with Nigeria]{.underline}, Africa's largest producer of oil
and its largest economy, **[to be among the most
important]{.underline}** on the continent. [The country is Africa's most
populous]{.underline}, with more than 200 million people, roughly evenly
divided between Muslims and Christians. [Nigeria,]{.underline} which
transitioned from military to civilian rule in 1999, [ranked for years
among the top **suppliers of U.S. oil imports**]{.underline}, and it is
a major recipient of U.S. foreign aid. [The country is the United
States' **second-largest trading partner** in Africa]{.underline} and
the third-largest beneficiary of U.S. foreign direct investment on the
continent. Nigerians comprise the largest African diaspora group in the
United States.

[Nigeria is a country of significant promise, but]{.underline} it also
[faces]{.underline} serious social, economic, and security
[challenges]{.underline}, some of [which pose threats to state and
regional stability.]{.underline} The country has faced intermittent
political turmoil and economic crises since gaining independence in 1960
from the United Kingdom. [Political life has been scarred by conflict
along ethnic, geographic, and religious lines, and corruption and
misrule have undermined the state's authority and
legitimacy.]{.underline} Despite extensive petroleum resources, its
human development indicators are among the world's lowest, and a
majority of the population faces extreme poverty. In the south, social
unrest, criminality, and corruption in the oil-producing Niger Delta
have hindered oil production and contributed to piracy in the Gulf of
Guinea. Perceived government neglect and economic marginalization have
also fueled resentment in the predominately Muslim north, while communal
grievances and competition over land and other resources--- sometimes
subject to political manipulation---drive conflict in the Middle Belt.

[The rise of Boko Haram]{.underline} has [heightened concerns about
extremist recruitment in Nigeria]{.underline}, which has one of the
world's largest Muslim populations. [Boko Haram has focused
on]{.underline} a range of targets, but [**civilians in the
impoverished**, predominately Muslim northeast]{.underline} have borne
the brunt of the violence. The group became notorious for its 2014
kidnapping of over 270 schoolgirls and its use of women and children as
suicide bombers. [It has staged attacks in neighboring countries and
**poses a threat to international targets in the region**.]{.underline}
Boko Haram appears primarily focused on the Lake Chad Basin region. Its
2015 pledge to the Islamic State and the emergence of a splinter
faction, Islamic State-West Africa (IS-WA), have raised concerns from
U.S. policymakers, though the extent of intergroup linkages is unclear.
IS-WA is credited with a number of devastating attacks in 2018 against
Nigerian military bases; the army has struggled to defend them.

Domestic criticism of the government's response to corruption, economic
pressures, and Boko Haram contributed to the election in 2015 of former
military ruler Muhammadu Buhari. In what was widely hailed as a historic
transition, the ruling People's Democratic Party and President Goodluck
Jonathan lost power to Buhari and his All Progressives Congress, marking
Nigeria's first democratic transfer of power. [Buhari has since
struggled to enact promised reforms amid persistent security challenges
and a struggling economy.]{.underline} He faces a challenge from former
vice president Atiku Abubakar in elections scheduled for February 2019;
it is forecast to be a close race. As in previous elections, there are
concerns about violence around the polls, and intense, high-stakes
contests over a number of legislative and gubernatorial posts increase
the risk of conflicts. U.S. officials and Members of Congress have
called for credible, transparent, and peaceful elections.

[U.S.-Nigeria relations under]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
Administration [appear]{.underline} generally [consistent with U.S.
policy under]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} Administration. Both
[Administrations have **supported reform initiatives** in Nigeria,
including anticorruption efforts, economic and electoral reforms, energy
sector privatization, and **programs to promote peace and
development**.]{.underline} Congress oversees more than \$500 million in
U.S. foreign aid programs in Nigeria and regularly monitors political
developments; some Members have expressed concern with corruption, human
rights abuses, and violent extremism in Nigeria.

soldiers from morale-sapped units have been known to make cash trading
guns on the side, Berman said.

The **[true scale of the problem is unknown]{.underline}** --- top brass
typically keep quiet about missing field artillery. At the very least,
"crates and crates" of thousands of weapons and millions of rounds of
ammunition have been lost to the bad guys, Berman said.

There are also reports of sniper rifles, field artillery and armored
vehicles going astray. Particularly desirable among insurgents are
"technicals," regular civilian off-road trucks that have been fitted
with machine guns, rocket launchers or other hardware.

\"[When a peacekeeping base gets overrun, the raid and its death toll is
the headline]{.underline}. \... But [somebody **also needs to track how
many guns, rocket-propelled grenades, ammunition rounds, vehicles,

### turn -- counter-terror -- links

#### Reducing arms to Nigeria [trades-off]{.underline} with counter-terror efforts

**DeCapua 14** -- Joe; interviews Jennifer Cooke of the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Studies follows U.S.-Nigeria
relations. ("Analysts Weigh Nigeria-Russia Arms Deal" VOA News. December
10, 2014.
<https://www.voanews.com/africa/analysts-weigh-nigeria-russia-arms-deal>)//GK

[Nigeria has turned to Russia to buy heavier weapons following a recent
strain in relations with the United States. [After the U.S. rejected a
request for Cobra attack helicopters, **Nigeria cancelled a U.S.
military training program linked to the fight against Boko Haram
militants**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Analysts now are weighing the effects
of the arms deal with Russia.

"In the broad sense, I think the relationships are good and enduring,\"
she said. \"But at this particular moment [[there is a great deal of
tension]{.mark} particularly [over the security
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Cooke is director of CSIS' Africa Program. Also watching developments in
Nigeria is Ben Moores, senior analyst at the defense and security
analysis organization IHS Jane\'s 360.

"I think the U.S. is still fully committed to supporting democracy in
Nigeria in terms of a trading relationship, in terms of military
equipment. I think it has changed somewhat with \[the\] withdrawal of
trainers -- a training team from Nigeria," he said.

There are several reasons, Moores said, why the U.S. would not sell
Nigeria advanced weapons systems.

"The advanced helicopters and fighter jets the U.S. has, they wouldn't
want to go to Nigeria because that equipment could be passed onto a
third party. And also selling fighter jets and attack helicopters to
Nigeria doesn't perhaps solve the problem that Nigeria has when dealing
with the insurgency. What you really need is a better motivated force, a
more professional force to deal with some of the social and cultural
problems that exist in Nigeria."

Jennifer Cooke said that each side has a different perception of the
situation.

"[[Nigeria's perception \[is\]]{.mark} that [the U.S.
is]{.mark}]{.underline} somehow [**[abandoning Nigeria in its moment of
need]{.mark}** as it's threatened by Boko Haram and not **providing the
kind of security and military assistance that Nigeria feels it needs
right now.**]{.underline} For the United States, there's deep concern
over Nigeria's response to Boko Haram -- a very military heavy response
\-- and one that has raised a lot of allegations about mass human rights
abuses," she said.

#### Weapons sales to Nigeria are [key]{.underline} to counter-terror efforts

**Cooper and Searcey 16** -- Helene Cooper and Dionne Searcey. ("After
Years of Distrust, U.S. Military Reconciles With Nigeria to Fight Boko
Haram" The New York Times. May 15, 2016.
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/world/africa/boko-haram-nigeria-us-arms-sales-warplanes.html>)//GK

ARUSHA, Tanzania --- Less than [two years after it blocked a sale of
American-made attack helicopters to Nigeria]{.underline} from Israel
[because of human rights concerns]{.underline}, the [Obama]{.underline}
administration [says it is poised to sell up to 12 light attack aircraft
to Nigeria as part of an **effort to support the country's fight against
the Boko Haram militant group.**]{.underline}

But the pending sale of the Super Tucano attack warplanes --- which
would require congressional approval --- is already coming under
criticism from human rights organizations that say President Muhammadu
Buhari of Nigeria has not yet done enough to stop the abuses and
corruption that flourished in the military under his predecessor,
Goodluck Jonathan.

Officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon have
been bracing for a fight with congressional Democrats, in particular
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, over the sale of the planes.

The [proposed sale reflects the **warming of the relationship** between
the Nigerian and American militaries]{.underline}, which had frayed
under Mr. Jonathan. The Pentagon often bypassed Nigeria in the fight
against Boko Haram, choosing to work directly with neighboring Cameroon,
Chad and Niger.

In addition to citing corruption and sweeping human rights abuses by
Nigerian soldiers, [American officials were hesitant to share
intelligence with the Nigerian military]{.underline}, saying Boko Haram
had infiltrated it. That accusation prompted indignation from Nigeria.

But [**that was before Mr. Buhari**, a former Nigerian Army major
general, **defeated Mr. Jonathan** in an election last
year.]{.underline}

Since coming into power, Mr. [Buhari]{.underline} has devoted himself to
rooting out graft in Africa's largest economy.

He has **[fired a number of Nigerian military officers accused of
corruption]{.underline}**, and [American military officials say they are
now working closely with some of their counterparts in
Nigeria.]{.underline} The Obama [administration is]{.underline} also
[considering sending dozens of Special Operations advisers to the front
lines of Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram]{.underline}, an insurgency
that has killed thousands of civilians in the country's northeast as
well as in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

Mr. Buhari has also pledged to investigate allegations of human rights
abuses and has said he will not tolerate them.

A move to sell the Super Tucano attack aircraft to Nigeria, first
reported by Reuters, would continue the détente between the two
militaries, administration officials said. [The Super
Tucano]{.underline}, a turboprop aircraft, [is designed for light
attack, counterinsurgency, close air support and reconnaissance
missions.]{.underline} It [could prove useful as the Nigerian military
tries to clear Boko Haram out of the Sambisa Forest, which is believed
to **hold large numbers of the militants, as well as kidnapped girls and
women**.]{.underline}

#### Sales to Nigeria are meant to [combat Boko Haram]{.underline}

**Lardner and Faul 17** -- Richard Lardner is from the Associated Press
and Michelle Faul. ("Trump to sell attack planes to Nigeria for Boko
Haram fight" Military Times. April 10, 2017.
<https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2017/04/10/trump-to-sell-attack-planes-tonigeria-for-boko-haram-fight/>)//GK

WASHINGTON --- The [Trump]{.underline} administration [will move forward
with]{.underline} the [sale of high-tech aircraft to Nigeria for its
**campaign against Boko Haram Islamic extremists**]{.underline} despite
concerns over abuses committed by the African nation\'s security forces,
according to U.S. officials.

Congress is expected to receive formal notification within weeks,
setting in motion a deal with Nigeria that the Obama administration had
planned to approve at the very end of Barack Obama\'s presidency. The
[arrangement will call for Nigeria to purchase up to 12 Embraer A-29
Super Tucano aircraft with sophisticated targeting gear for nearly \$600
million]{.underline}, one of the officials said.

The officials were not authorized to discuss the terms of the sale
publicly and requested anonymity to speak about internal diplomatic
conversations.

Though President Donald [Trump has made clear his intention to approve
the sale of the aircraft]{.underline}, the National Security Council is
still working on the issue. Military sales to several other countries
are also expected to be approved but are caught up in an ongoing White
House review. [Nigeria has been trying to buy the aircraft since
2015.]{.underline}

The Nigerian air force has been accused of bombing civilian targets at
least three times in recent years. In the worst incident, a fighter jet
on Jan. 17 repeatedly bombed a camp at Rann, near the border with
Cameroon, where civilians had fled from Boko Haram. Between 100 and 236
civilians and aid workers were killed, according to official and
community leaders\' counts.

That bombing occurred on the same day the Obama administration intended
to officially notify Congress the sale would go forward. Instead, it was
abruptly put on hold, according to an individual who worked on the issue
during Obama\'s presidency. Days later, Trump was inaugurated.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said this past week that he supported the A-29 deal to
Nigeria as well as the sale of U.S.-made fighter jets to Bahrain that
had been stripped of human rights caveats imposed by the Obama
administration.

Under Obama, the U.S. said Bahrain failed to make promised political and
human rights reforms after its Sunni-ruled government crushed Arab
Spring protests five years ago.

\"We need to deal with human rights issues, but not on weapons sales,\"
Corker said.

The State Department said in a 2016 report that the Nigerian government
has taken \"few steps to investigate or prosecute officials who
committed violations, whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the
government, and impunity remained widespread at all levels of
government.\"

Amnesty International has accused Nigeria\'s military of war crimes and
crimes against humanity in the extrajudicial killings of an estimated
8,000 Boko Haram suspects. President Muhammadu Buhari promised to
investigate the alleged abuses after he won office in March 2015, but no
soldier has been prosecuted and thousands of people remain in illegal
military detention. Nigeria\'s military has denied the allegations.

The A-29 sale would improve the U.S. relationship with Nigeria,
Africa\'s largest consumer market of 170 million people, the
continent\'s biggest economy and its second-largest oil producer.
Nigeria also is strategically located on the edge of the Sahel, the
largely lawless semi-desert region bridging north and sub-Saharan Africa
where experts warn Islamic extremists like the Nigeria-based Boko Haram
may expand their reach.

[The aircraft deal also would satisfy Trump\'s priorities to support
nations fighting Islamic uprisings,]{.underline} boost U.S.
manufacturing and create high-wage jobs at home. The A-29 aircraft,
which allow pilots to pinpoint targets at night, are assembled in
Jacksonville, Florida.

[\"**It\'s hard to argue that any country in Africa is more important
than Nigeria for the geopolitical and other strategic interests of the
U.S.,\"** said J. Peter Pham, vice president of the Atlantic Council in
Washington and head of its Africa Center.]{.underline}

### turn -- counter-terror -- boko Haram bad

#### A strengthened Boko Haram [turns]{.underline} their [ethical claims]{.underline} -- the group causes mass [structural violence]{.underline}

**Campbell and Harwood 18** -- John Campbell is the Ralph Bunche Senior
Fellow for Africa Policy Studies and Asch Hardwood. ("Boko Haram's
Deadly Impact" Council on Foreign Relations. August 20, 2018.
<https://www.cfr.org/article/boko-harams-deadly-impact>)//GK

[Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram remains **one of the region's
deadliest conflicts**]{.underline} despite a major military offensive to
contain the African Islamist militant group and support from
international partners. A new study of the conflict offers fresh
perspective on how lethal it has been, especially for civilians, and the
pattern behind Boko Haram's attacks. Since 2009, [the Boko Haram
insurgency has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, and
violence by militants and security forces continues daily.]{.underline}

The study shows that though Boko Haram's territorial control is now
limited to some small villages and pockets of countryside, a shift in
tactics has helped the group stay a threat to millions. It has turned to
suicide bombings, which accounted for almost a third of all casualties
in the first half of 2018, and has increasingly attacked Muslim places
of worship. [It continues to challenge government authority in Nigeria's
northeast and beyond]{.underline}, and it reportedly collects taxes and
provides some services in areas it controls.

For its part, the Nigerian government holds thousands of alleged Boko
Haram fighters, including women, children, and elderly people. The
United Nations' refugee agency estimates [the conflict has **displaced
2.4 million people and put more than seven million at risk of
starvation**.]{.underline} It has also [led to the degradation of
infrastructure, including]{.underline} the closing or [destruction
of]{.underline} more than half of the region's [schools,
and]{.underline} the near-complete [breakdown of]{.underline} an already
[weak public health system]{.underline}. While this study provides
insight into the evolving tactics and targets of the group, which is now
split into at least two factions, it does not show the wider harms
caused by the conflict, such as disrupted communities and stunted
economic development.

[Boko Haram's]{.underline} four-year-old [insurgency]{.underline} has
[pitted neighbour against neighbour, **cost more than 4,000 lives,
displaced close to half a million, destroyed hundreds of schools and
government buildings and devastated an already ravaged economy** in the

Cameroon, [**weak countries poorly equipped** to combat a radical
Islamist armed group]{.underline} tapping into real governance,
corruption, impunity and underdevelopment grievances shared by most
people in the region. [Boko Haram is]{.underline} both **[a serious
challenge and manifestation of more profound threats to Nigeria's
security]{.underline}**. Unless the federal and state governments, and
the region, develop and implement comprehensive plans to tackle not only
insecurity but also the injustices that drive much of the troubles, Boko
Haram, or groups like it, will continue to destabilise large parts of
the country. Yet, the government's response is largely military, and
political will to do more than that appears entirely lacking.

Nigeria on childhood wasting: a double-difference study" US National
Library of Medicine -- National Institutes of Health. January 24, 2018.
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5782364/>)//GK

[Conflict impacts child health through multiple pathways.]{.underline}
Community and household [resources may be diminished as funds are
**diverted away from social services**, prices for food and other
commodities rise]{.underline}, and fear or physical obstacles prevent
caregivers from pursuing livelihood activities \[1, 2\]. [Infrastructure
such as **health facilities, markets, water supply and sewage systems**,
and roads may be damaged or otherwise inaccessible]{.underline} \[1,
2\]. [Supply chains for food]{.underline} imports and essential
medicines [are often disrupted]{.underline} \[1, 2\]. [Populations may
be forced to leave a conflict zone, which could **expose them to
inadequate shelter, water, sanitation, and food and deprive them of
livelihoods**]{.underline} \[1, 2\]. Health care personnel may leave the
area while the most vulnerable households may be unable to do so \[2\].

Most [deaths due to conflict]{.underline} - particularly for [children -
are not from direct causes such as war-related trauma, but are
attributable to]{.underline} the conditions that were already the main
causes of death before the conflict ([**severe malnutrition, diarrheal
disease, acute respiratory infections**, etc]{.underline}.) \[3\].
Malnutrition is of particular interest in the study of child health and
conflict because a) it is a contributing condition in about 45% of child
deaths worldwide and b) it is sensitive to disruptions commonly found in
war zones such as increased food insecurity \[3, 4\]. In the Democratic
Republic of Congo, malnutrition was cited by respondents as an
underlying or primary cause of death in 8.1% of deaths in non-conflict
areas and 10.9% of deaths in conflict areas \[5\]. In Angola, higher
rates of malnutrition were found in conflict-affected areas and among
assumed supporters of the opposition \[6\].

The objective of this study is to explore whether conflict has had a
deleterious effect on the nutritional status of children in Northeast
Nigeria by examining the counterfactual -- what the status of children
would have been had they not been exposed to conflict. Here, nutritional
status is confined to wasting (low weight-for-height), as it is the
preferred measure in acute emergencies because weight is sensitive to
sudden changes in food availability and infections \[1, 6, 7\]. It is
hypothesized that that children not exposed to conflict will display
better nutritional status than those exposed to conflict, both in terms
of mean weight-for-height and the likelihood of being wasted.

Nigeria and Boko Haram

[Nigeria is Africa's most populous country]{.underline} and among its
most diverse with over 400 ethnolinguistic groups \[8\]. [The country is
affected by several conflicts]{.underline} based on overlapping ethnic,
religious, political and regional divisions including over resources in
the Niger Delta, Christian-Muslim divides in the middle of the country,
[and most recently, the rise of Islamist groups in the north, **most
importantly, Boko Haram**]{.underline} \[8\]. Boko Haram ('Western
education is a sin') was founded around 2002 in Maiduguri, the capital
of Borno state and largest city in Northeast Nigeria (Fig. 1) \[9\]. At
least at its inception, [the main tenet among its followers was regime
change in Nigeria as they believe democratic and secular rule is in
contradiction to Shariah]{.underline} \[9\].

In July 2009, the Boko Haram uprising began in Bauchi and spread to
other northern states, leaving hundreds of followers, Nigerian law
enforcement officers, and civilians dead \[10\]. The following year,
attacks in the Northeast and other parts of the country including
bombings, mass shootings, and executions began to rise \[10\].

In May 2013, [**the president declared a state of emergency** in the
states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa]{.underline} \[10\]. For this study,
these states are defined as "conflict affected" and are compared to
Bauchi, Gombe, and Taraba (the "non-conflict states"). [People in the
non-conflict states **have certainly been affected** by the
crisis]{.underline}, but [the entire population of Borno, Yobe, and
Adamawa states are considered **directly impacted** by the Boko Haram
insurgency]{.underline} \[11\]. Fig. 2 shows a timeline of violent
deaths attributed to events involving Boko Haram, which serve as a proxy
for the intensity of the conflict. The timeline also shows July 2009 as
a hard date for the start of the crisis in its current violent form
\[12\]. This serves as the demarcation between pre-intervention and
post-intervention for this study.

impounded a large quantity of arms and ammunition smuggled through

[**Crime, insecurity, and conflict** are among the most important
drivers of demand, necessitating a response that focuses on the

communities can have a direct effect on reducing demand for craft
weapons. This in turn can have a positive impact on curbing the supply

including AK-47 rifles, rocket launchers and machine guns -- to Niger
Delta militants between January 2000 and December 2006. These arms were
stolen from the depots of the Nigerian Army at the Command and Staff

[The Nigerian government]{.underline} has not only [increased spending
on the military forces, but]{.underline} has [also increased funding for
the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON).
DICON]{.underline}, located in a large compound in Kaduna in the north
of the country, [is the]{.underline} only [facility **authorized to
produce arms and ammunition in Nigeria**.]{.underline} It was created in
1964 to supply arms and ammunition to the police and military in order
to meet the needs of the newly independent country. Over the past
several decades, successive administrations neglected the facility and
failed to provide it with sufficient funding, and it fell into
disrepair. From 1999 President Obasanjo refocused attention on internal
production capacity and how to refurbish the defunct company. At least
two companies, one in South Africa and one in China, have expressed
interest in assisting with the refurbishment of the company, but these
deals never came to pass. Instead, it appears the Nigerian government
has decided to conduct the refurbishment on its own.

In 2006 [Obasanjo authorized funding of NGN 1 billion (USD 8 million)
for DICON to **refurbish the company's production facilities** and
**begin the process of designing an AK-47-type assault rifle** for
production in Nigeria.]{.underline} The refurbishment has reportedly
brought the factory to nearly 70 per cent of its normal production
levels (Buhari, 2007). [DICON]{.underline} has reported that it has
[finished the prototypes of the Nigerian-made AK-47 rifle]{.underline},
dubbed the OBJ-006 after President Obasanjo**[, and is now ready to
commence mass production]{.underline}** (Vanguard, 2007a). There are no
figures available on how many rifles this would entail, or what other
arms or ammunition DICON will now produce. DICON has reported that it
has restored its production capacities for ammunition and rifles, which
have not been manufactured for the past several years due to dilapidated
equipment (Vanguard, 2007a). [Undoubtedly the infusion of funds has
assisted in the refurbishment process. The]{.underline} 2007 national
[budget provides NGN 413,700,904 (USD 3.3 million) for the
company.]{.underline} While just under two-thirds of this amount will go
toward salaries and benefits for company workers, the remainder will pay
for the ongoing rehabilitation of the various facilities and
infrastructure, and for capital investment, including NGN 35,000,000
(USD 280,000) for the new rifle (Nigeria, 2007).

[Craft weapons production in Nigeria is under-researched, yet it is
highly relevant for any future actions to counter small arms and light
weapons proliferation]{.underline}.1 This Briefing Paper provides new
research findings based on extensive fieldwork in four Nigerian states
(Adamawa, Anambra, Benue, and Plateau). It reviews demand and supply
factors that shape the craft market in Nigeria, finding that [demand is
driven by insecurity and conflict]{.underline}, but also by cultural and
societal factors. **[Supply is mostly demand driven.]{.underline}** The
quality of the products and production methods varies greatly across the
surveyed states. [Craft production poses a significant challenge for the
Nigerian state and will require a mix of holistic measures to regulate
or deter it]{.underline}, ranging from improving security (and security
perceptions) and the relationship between security providers and
communities, to licensing, measures aimed at providing alternative
livelihoods for craft producers, and a more comprehensive application of
the relevant legal framework.

Key findings

About [one-fifth]{.underline} (17 per cent) [of civilian]{.underline},
rural weapons holders countrywide [**possess craft weapons** and
one-tenth in urban areas, according to preliminary findings from the
National Small Arms and Light Weapons Survey]{.underline} (NSALWS).

[Craft producers **employ a range of blacksmithing
techniques**]{.underline}, and the type and [quality of their weapons
vary greatly, ranging from muzzle-loading 'Dane guns' to 9 mm
semiautomatic pistols]{.underline} based on Beretta models, and to
assault rifles and sub-machine guns. [Break-action shotguns and pistols
are the most popular craft weapons produced in surveyed
states.]{.underline}

[Craft weapons are]{.underline} mostly [purchased to protect and defend
individuals and communities]{.underline}. Many **[producers are
convinced that craft production is a form of community service in times
of heightened insecurity.]{.underline}**

[Craft weapons are]{.underline} frequently [**purchased because of their
ease of access and reduced price**, which is up to four times cheaper
than their industrially produced counterparts]{.underline}. Craft
weapons are often produced in clandestine workshops that safeguard
blacksmiths' anonymity and safety.

### alt cause -- stockpile management

#### Poor [stockpile management]{.underline} is a [leading factor]{.underline} of illicit small arms -- not legal sales

\"It is widely acknowledged that [one of the **major factors**
contributing to the illicit proliferation of arms is the **ineffective
stockpile management**]{.underline}\", he said.

The UNREC boss stressed that [unsecured stocks and ineffectively managed
stockpiles were a major contributing factor to the trafficking and
diversion of arms into the illicit market]{.underline} and their
subsequent flow to terrorists and other criminal groups as Boko Haram
and Niger Delta militants.

He said that part of the activities programmed under the PSSM in the
Sahel project in the context of the UN and European Union (EU) was to
support security and stability in the region.

Yabouri explained that the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs
(UNODA) had developed the project, which is jointly funded by the EU,
for the benefit of the six Sahel countries of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria.

\"This project aims to support states in the region to prevent diversion
and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition, by improving the PSSM of
national stockpiles\", he added.

Meanwhile, the Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons
(PRESCOM) has disclosed that the federal government has concluded plans
to destroy over 5000 illicit weapons recovered in Zamfara State, North
West of the country.

The chairman of the committee, Ambassador Emmanuel Imohe, also revealed
that about [425 weapons were also recovered from criminals and destroyed
in Katsina State, while Benue State had over 600 weapons
destroyed.]{.underline}

He stressed that [PRESCOM]{.underline} do not just recover these weapons
but [wants to]{.underline} also \"[trace their origins and hold the
countries that are responsible accountable]{.underline}, using the
International Tracing Instrument.\"

ABUJA (Reuters) - **[[Nigeria will protest]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} over [[conditions imposed
on]{.mark} its planned [\$494 million purchase of]{.mark} 12 A-29 Super
Tucano [fighter planes]{.mark}]{.underline}, Defence Minister Mansur Dan
Ali said on Thursday.

Those [conditions include the 2020 transfer date for the aircraft and
that Nigerian technicians will not be trained by U.S. staff, be part of
maintenance crews, nor can they study the production of the
planes]{.underline}, he told reporters at a briefing in Abuja.

The [sale of the planes has been dogged by controversy]{.underline}.
Under Barack Obama, the former U.S. president, the aircraft deal had
been held off due to concerns about the Nigerian military's human rights
abuses. In one instance, up to 170 people died last January after the
air force bombed a refugee camp in the northeastern town of Rann.

But President Donald Trump's administration approved the sale to support
Nigeria's efforts to fight Boko Haram militants and to boost U.S.
defence jobs, sources told Reuters last April. In December, Nigeria's
air force said the deal had been formally agreed.

[Dan Ali did not say whether the disagreement over the conditions would
affect the air force's Feb. 20 target for the final
agreements]{.underline} to be signed and initial payments made.

["**[These conditions we will not accept]{.mark}**," he
said.]{.underline}

["(Nigeria's) security council has approved the purchase of the
aircrafts but some of the [conditions America gave]{.mark} us [are
stringent]{.mark}.]{.underline} We will discuss reducing the conditions
with the American ambassador, (and) [[payments will be made when the
conditions are reduced]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### The United States federal government should:

#### -insist on securing robust, binding end use guarantees and post-delivery monitoring regarding arms sales to Nigeria, 

#### -insist the Nigerian government undertake independent investigations in human rights violations by the military, and that all reports on violations be made public, with victims receiving full reparation, and 

#### -ensure personnel operating military equipment are trained to comply with human rights law.

[Our message to]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} administration [was
that the US should insist on securing robust, binding **end use/r
guarantees, post-delivery monitoring to verify all recipients** are
operating consistently with full **respect for international human
rights** and humanitarian law, and **end user certificate restrictions
are being honored, safeguards against further serious human rights
violations**, and other credible and measurable progress on
accountability]{.underline} within the Nigerian security forces. These
[recommendations were offered with the aim of ensuring]{.underline} that
the [United States did not inadvertently facilitate the commission of
human rights violations in Nigeria]{.underline} and to ensure that the
US is doing everything it can to end the culture of impunity within the
Nigerian military with respect to human rights.

In our earlier letter, we listed several incidents of serious human
rights violations that indicated a systemic failure to respect human
rights and enforce accountability within the Nigerian security forces
(see attached). Unfortunately, to date there has been no progress
towards investigating any of those past incidents or bringing persons
responsible for those violations to justice. Indeed, the Nigerian Air
Force bombing of a remote displaced persons camp in Rann in January 2017
demonstrates the urgency of implementing safeguards and monitoring with
respect to human rights. The bombing of that camp, close to the Cameroon
border, killed at least 126 people (and possibly as many as 200).

Although a panel appointed by the Nigerian Air Force to investigate the
tragedy presented its report to the Chief of Air Force in April, the
report is yet to be made public and speculations about the bombing are
rife. The Chief of Air Force has stated that the bombing was a human
error. However, witnesses claim that the fighter jet circled the camp at
least twice before it bombed the camp.

In view of the continuing patterns of abuse and potential for misuse of
US-supplied equipment, the [U.S. Congress should insist that the
Nigerian government **undertake independent investigation** into all
allegations of human rights violations by the military.]{.underline} Any
such [reports on human rights violations by the military in northeast
Nigeria **should be made public**, including on the Rann
bombing]{.underline}. Further, all [**victims should receive full
reparation**, including financial compensation.]{.underline}

Before approving the intended transfer of the Tucano aircraft, [Congress
should ensure]{.underline} that [Nigerian military personnel involved in
its operation and command will be **rigorously vetted**]{.underline} in
order [to screen out those responsible for past human rights
violations]{.underline} and violations of international humanitarian
law. Moreover, steps [should be taken to ensure that **personnel
operating the equipment** are adequately trained to comply with
international human rights and humanitarian law and
standards.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [we ask]{.underline} you as [Congressional leaders to
insist on **binding guarantees from the Nigerian government that the
equipment will be used in conformity with US and international
law**]{.underline}. Likewise, [Congress should seek guarantees from the
Trump Administration that the Department of Defense will effectively
monitor the use of these aircraft for compliance]{.underline} with
international human rights and humanitarian law.

frequently wound up being used against Americans in combat. And even
more often, local and regional actors, including criminal gangs, have
employed them in their own conflicts. [In civil wars, regime collapse,

[Moores explained why **[Nigeria would turn to Russia for the types of

"[[Russia is known to sell equipment at a]{.underline}]{.mark}
relatively [**[low cost]{.mark}**. It's known to sell to pretty much

guarantees in terms of the where the equipment will go]{.underline} --

What's more, he said, [[Russia may give Nigeria a **billion-dollar line

The IHS Jane's analyst said that [Nigeria has a long wish list of
military hardware]{.underline}, including jet trainers, light to medium

[Moscow has also used arms sales to **sway African leaders to give them
preferential access to their countries' natural
resources.**]{.underline} Negotiations between Russian and Zimbabwean
diplomats in 2012 over what was essentially an arms-for-platinum deal
helped Moscow gain a \$3 billion stake in Zimbabwe's huge Darwendale
platinum deposit in 2014. Russia's ability to extend this approach
elsewhere in Africa remains unclear, however, as its attempts to forge a
similar arms-for-minerals agreement with the Central African Republic
have failed due to China's overwhelming dominance over copper, gold and
diamond reserves there.

Beyond mining and other resources, Russia is still eyeing energy sectors
in sub-Saharan Africa, as it promotes nuclear power as a driver of
economic development. Its most prominent move came in 2014, with a
landmark but controversial \$76 billion deal for Russian energy giant
Rosatom to build two nuclear power plants in South Africa, which has the
continent's only nuclear power station. Then-President Jacob Zuma
personally championed the deal, bypassing South Africa's parliament.
When the deal collapsed in 2017 after a South African court ruled it
unlawful, Russia was forced to look elsewhere in Africa for nuclear
energy clients.

That search has achieved some notable success. Last October, [Rosatom
signed a \$20 billion deal to construct two nuclear power plants in
Nigeria, Africa's largest economy.]{.underline} Russia is now set to
play a leading role in eliminating Nigeria's chronic electricity
shortages, winning it praise. [The Nigeria deal also encouraged Lavrov
to negotiate with Angola on the construction of nuclear power
plants]{.underline}, and to forge a nuclear technology-sharing agreement
with Namibia, the world's fourth largest producer of uranium.

The [**growing appeal of Russian weaponry** has pushed several African
leaders to ask Moscow for help in carrying out counterterrorism
operations.]{.underline}

When it comes to security, Russia has focused chiefly on expanding its
array of existing arms contracts and positioning itself as a useful
counterterrorism partner. [Russia has emphasized its willingness to sell
arms to governments **without discrimination on ideological or human
rights grounds**, portraying itself as a **reliable arms vendor to
authoritarian African leaders**.]{.underline} Many of those leaders see
proof of Russia's commitment to noninterference in Moscow's strident
defense of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe against potential
U.N. sanctions in 2008, along with Russian arms sales to Sudan after its
president, Omar al-Bashir, was indicted by the International Criminal
Court in 2009.

[This hands-off policy has helped Russia expand beyond its traditional
Soviet-era coterie in sub-Saharan Africa.]{.underline} Since 2010,
Russia has supplied Uganda with 74 percent of its conventional weaponry,
signed a \$1 billion defense cooperation agreement with Angola, and
agreed to a major military-technical cooperation pact with Nigeria.
These deals are likely to continue to expand in the years to come, as
Russia's effective use of air power during its military intervention in
Syria and successful marketing of its S-400 missile defense
system---which it recently sold to Turkey, a NATO member---increase its
influence over international arms markets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - **[The U.S. State Department halted the planned
sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines' national police
after Senator Ben Cardin said he would oppose it, Senate aides told
Reuters on Monday.]{.underline}**

**[Aides said Cardin]{.underline}**, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, **[was reluctant for the United States to
provide the weapons given concerns about human rights violations in the
Philippines.]{.underline}**

**[News of the thwarting of the weapons sale was met with disappointment
among the Philippine police and government on Tuesday, but they said
alternative suppliers would be found.]{.underline}** Police spokesman
Dionardo Carlos said the Philippines had yet to be notified about the
sale being stopped.

**[The relationship between the United States and the Philippines, a
long-time ally, has been complicated lately by President Rodrigo
Duterte's angry reaction to criticism from Washington of his violent
battle to rid the country of illegal drugs.]{.underline}**

More than 2,300 people have been killed in police operations or by
suspected vigilantes in connection with the anti-narcotics campaign
since Duterte took office on June 30.

The U.S. State Department informs Congress when international weapons
sales are in the works. **[Aides said Foreign Relations committee staff
informed State that Cardin would oppose the deal during the department's
prenotification process for the sale of 26,000-27,000 assault rifles,

#### U.S. lacks influence in the region in the status quo---the plan would only dig us into a deeper hole 

**Welna '17** \[David Welna is NPR\'s national security correspondent,
"With Mattis Trip To Philippines, Reminders Of Waning U.S. Influence In
Region", *NPR,* 10/25/17,
https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/10/25/559993089/with-mattis-trip-to-philippines-reminders-of-waning-u-s-influence-in-region\]//a.bhaiji

The steel-plated, modified Boeing 747 that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis
travels the world on had flown west from suburban Washington, D.C., for
19 hours when it touched down Monday on an airstrip the U.S. once owned
and operated.

**[Clark Air Base in the Philippines used to be home to American bombers
that pummeled Vietnam during the 1960s and early 1970s. And just as that
ultimately futile U.S. intervention would become emblematic of a
faltering American dominance in the region]{.underline}**, so too is
Clark Air Base now a ramshackle relic from another era, a time before
the Philippines --- **[the United States\' oldest ally in Asia ---
reclaimed its sovereignty and politely showed the Americans the
door.]{.underline}**

**[Mattis\' trip to the Philippines had been billed as routine --- a
show of the American flag at an annual gathering of defense chiefs from
10 Southeast Asian nations. But it came at a time when things are
anything but routine in that part of the world. Events
there]{.underline}** --- primarily North Korea\'s sprint to nuclear
warhead operability --- are forcing the Trump administration to make
real the pivot to Asia to which the Obama administration aspired.

As it happened, the day Mattis landed might have showcased the U.S. as
the still-indispensable nation in that part of the world. Washington had
five months earlier dispatched military counter-terrorism experts, as
well as spying technology and small arms, to help a severely tested
Philippine effort to counter an ISIS-inspired insurgency in the city of
Marawi on the island of Mindanao.

But shortly after Mattis settled into his hotel at the old air base,
Philippine Defense Minister Delfin Negrillo Lorenzana made an unexpected
public announcement.

\"**[The Filipino government,\" he said, \"aided by the government and
massive support of the Filipino people, nipped the budding
infrastructure and defeated terrorism in the
Philippines.\"]{.underline}**

The siege of Marawi was officially over -- but with nary an official nod
of credit to the key American assistance in putting down the insurgency.

**[Instead, Manila\'s official praise was reserved for Russia and
China.]{.underline}** Both had provided weapons that the Obama
administration had failed to deliver due to concerns about Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte\'s violent crackdown on suspected drug
traffickers.

**[Beijing donated 6,000 rifles and 9 million rounds of ammunition
earlier this year. Russia timed its gift of 5,000 AK-47 Kalashnikov
rifles and 20 military trucks to coincide with this week\'s gathering of
defense ministers -- and perhaps the arrival of Mattis]{.underline}**.

MANILA **[- President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday said his
administration will no longer purchase arms and military equipment from
the United States after the latter threatened to impose sanctions on
countries buying military equipment from Russia.]{.underline}**

In a speech in front of soldiers in Bulacan, **[Duterte said he will not
look to buy arms from the US, a treaty ally of the Philippines, after
Washington blocked an arms deal with Manila upon the opposition of an
American senator who raised concerns about human rights violations
here.]{.underline}**

**[Duterte claimed that aside from Russia, the US was also against
Manila purchasing arms from China,]{.underline}** Washington's chief
economic and geopolitical rival.

"Pagka bumili ka sa China o maybe Russia, magsali ka sa embargo. You
cannot trade with America. So para kang inipit doon sa ano. Eh sabi ko
naman sa \-\-- your superiors and the civilian leaders, with that kind
of arrangement, do not expect me to buy arms from the United States," he
said.

(**[If you buy arms from China or Russia, you will be sanctioned due to
the arms embargo. You cannot trade with America. So it's like you're
pushed to a corner. I said to the superiors and civilian leaders, with
that kind of arrangement, do not expect me to buy arms from the United
States.)]{.underline}**

Duterte said he would instead seek arms from other Philippine allies,
such as Israel and South Korea.

"I will not agree to buy \[from the US\]. Pangit tingnan. Hindi maganda.
It does not sit well with the Filipino na ganunin ka tapos pasunod-sunod
ka na lang. Wala naman akong galit sa kanila. Sila 'yung nauna. And they
criticized me heavily dito sa drugs," he said.

(**[I will not agree to buy \[from the US\]. It looks bad. It would not
sit well with Filipinos that you are being told what to do. I am not
angry at them, but they were the first to hit me. And they criticized me
heavily for my war on drugs.)]{.underline}**

Duterte made this announcement even as Defense Secretary Delfin
Lorenzana announced last month that the Philippines will buy 16 Black
Hawk helicopters from the Sikorsky Aircraft Corp for P12.67 billion
(\$240 million), shunning cheaper Russian equipment due to U.S.
sanctions on Russian military exports.

PH to buy US helicopters, not Russian, due to sanctions: Lorenzana

The Philippines is spending P300 billion (\$5.6 billion) over the next 5
years to upgrade its defense capability, replacing World War II-era
warships and Vietnam War-vintage fighters and helicopters.

It recently acquired fighter jets from South Korea, logistics ships from
Indonesia, and armored vehicles and ship-borne missiles from Israel. -

Security in the Asia-Pacific Nevertheless, **[U.S.-Philippines ties are
likely to remain a pillar of U.S. security policy in Asia for years to
come. The alliance is among the United States' five defense pacts in the
region, including agreements with Australia, Japan, South Korea, and
Thailand. "These alliances are the bedrock of U.S. foreign policy \[in
Asia\], and the Philippines relationship is crucial,"]{.underline}**
says CSIS's Bower. Manila has made a concerted effort to improve its
armed forces. In late 2012 the Philippines passed a revised AFP
Modernization Act \[PDF\] for the acquisition of equipment and weapons
systems to boost naval, air force, and army capabilities for a "minimum
credible defense." Defense spending in the Philippines more than tripled
from 1998 to 2015, from \$1.2 billion to \$3.8 billion, according to
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates. The
archipelago would like to be self-reliant, but the AFP have substantial
ground to cover. Traditionally, the AFP focused on internal threats to
protect the country and were dominated by the army. More recently,
Southeast Asian militaries, including that of the Philippines, have
reoriented their focus to include maritime domain awareness. Still, the
Philippines military has been described by the Jamestown Foundation and
other analysts as one of the world's weakest, plagued by insufficient
funds and endemic corruption**[. According to Heydarian, it has a hard
time keeping pace with other defense forces in the region, causing it to
rely more heavily than ever on the United States to ensure its national
security.]{.underline}** The Philippines has also built closer exchanges
with regional partners like Australia and Japan. **[Despite Duterte's
initial foreign policy shifts, experts caution that he cannot cut ties
with Washington without risking backlash from both the Philippine
political and military establishment and the Philippine
public.]{.underline}** Leadership transitions in the United States and
the Philippines may present diplomatic challenges, yet defense ties are
expected to remain strong. Still, Bower says**[, U.S. and Philippine
leaders alike must make strong cases to their peoples for maintaining
this historic relationship and building a regional security network
across a spectrum of capabilities, budgets, personnel, and
expertise.]{.underline}**

Both Western leaders and those involved within the region have been
eager to declare victory over the Islamic State after retaking the major
cities, such as Mosul and Raqqa, that the group has controlled since
2013. But it\'s too soon to be complacent. **[The Islamic State is
already thinking about how to regroup. The Philippines is a long way
from the group\'s birthplace in the Middle East---but the jihadis have
already seized and held a city there for three months,]{.underline}**
and exerted a grim cost on the country\'s security forces to retake it.

**[The Philippines has a long history of Islamic militancy dating back
to the 1970s]{.underline}**, when the Moro National Liberation Front
began battling the government in its quest for greater autonomy from the
central government in Manila. After various splits and splintering
within the Moro National Liberation Front, the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front emerged in 1984 and continued to wage a low-intensity insurgency
throughout the southern Philippines. **[Another Islamic militant
organization, the Abu Sayyaf Group, formed in the early 1990s and has
formed links with al Qaeda and other Islamic militant groups throughout
Southeast Asia, including Jemaah Islamiyah.]{.underline}**

Islamic State is a latecomer to the islands. It had only limited
interest in the Philippines before 2016, when its caliphate in the
Middle East was already under severe strain. Moreover, while over a
half-dozen Philippine factions pledged allegiance to the Islamic State,
the organization didn\'t reciprocate: It never publicly acknowledged an
official wilayat, or franchise, in the Philippines. In a video produced
at the end of June 2016 by the Philippines media office, the Islamic
State highlighted the formal relationship between its core and the
militants in the Philippines, but this was not an official wilayat
announcement.

Southeast Asian militants also have little battle experience with the
Islamic State. The nearly 1,600 South and Southeast Asian foreign
fighters who traveled to Iraq and Syria to join the group would have
made up just 5 percent of the total number of Islamic State foreign
fighters, estimated to be pushing 30,000, according to a report by The
Soufan Center, an international consulting company.

And yet, **[despite receiving far less attention than other Islamic
State franchise groups]{.underline}**---including in Libya, the Sinai
Peninsula, and Afghanistan---**[Islamist militants who have espoused an
affinity for the Islamic State were able to dramatically seize
Marawi,]{.underline}** the largest city in Mindanao\'s autonomous
region, with a population of 200,000. And even though militants in the
Philippines never received official Islamic State wilayat status**[,
there are strong ideological links that have even extended to something
more tangible.]{.underline}** The combined counteroffensive against the
militants failed to recapture Marawi from a loose coalition of these
Islamic State-linked factions, including the Abu Sayyaf Group and the
Maute group, whose effectiveness was bolstered by Islamic State material
support. The core group reportedly sent nearly \$2 million to militants
in the Philippines to help the group wage battle. The Philippines fits
the Islamic State\'s template of seeking to instigate and latch onto
existing ethnic conflicts with sectarian issues, with Muslims from the
south competing with Christians from the predominantly Catholic north.

Despite intense assaults and heavy doses of firepower by Philippine
security forces, the militants were able to hold the city for more than
three months. The feat was even more impressive considering the
counterinsurgent force included elite U.S.-trained special operations
forces, and---reportedly---U.S. forces that operated quietly alongside
them on the ground.

**[The situation on the ground in the southern Philippines is uncertain
today. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte proclaimed Marawi
"liberated"]{.underline}** on Oct. 17, one day after his security forces
killed Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute, the top two leaders of the
jihadis in Marawi. **[However, looming insecurity and a humanitarian
crisis will pose a major challenge to reconstruction efforts in Marawi,
and extremism is likely to increase among the population in response to
the bloody government counterterror campaign and threaten the peace
process between Manila and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, experts suspect Duterte might have
inflated enemy casualty statistics in order to declare Marawi liberated,
making it possible for surviving fighters to return to localities where
they enjoyed local support and to regroup for future combat.

**[Marawi may be a taste of things to come]{.underline}**. With its
Middle Eastern strongholds destroyed, the Islamic State is likely to
become more fragmented and to shift greater attention to new regions,
from Southeast Asia to sub-Saharan Africa. The foreign fighters who came
to Iraq and Syria from around the world may become the nucleus of
expanded movements in their home regions. And with its caliphate gone,
the Islamic State may attempt to revisit its strategy of designating
official franchise groups in an attempt to give its brand a much-needed
refurbishment and boost.

**[Southeast Asia has long been a hotbed of Islamic extremism and
violence.]{.underline}** For example, neighboring Indonesia---the
world\'s most populous Muslim country---was the original home of key al
Qaeda leaders before the 9/11 attacks. More recently it has seen an
uptick of arrests related to terrorist plots by Islamic extremists.
Still, the nucleus of jihadis actively fighting in, and possibly
returning to, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries is
relatively small compared to other countries in other regions such as
North Africa. Nonetheless, **[as the core Islamic State unravels, the
Philippines is likely to continue to become increasingly useful to the
group as a safety valve outside of the Middle East.]{.underline}**

**[The Philippines is likely to remain a ripe target due to its large
Muslim population, the presence of pre-existing radical Islamist violent
and nonviolent fringe movements, the permissiveness of its formal and
informal financial systems, weak local institutions, and a leader in
Duterte who is heading an administration that has overseen a crisis in
Marawi]{.underline}** that has resulted in dozens of civilians killed
and hundreds of thousands displaced.

**[For much of the past 15 years, U.S. special operations forces were
active in the Philippines supporting elite Philippine military and law
enforcement counterterrorism units as part of the global war on terror.
This light-footprint effort is considered among the most successful
counterterrorism campaigns in Operation Enduring Freedom-Philippines,
the largest U.S. counterterrorism effort in the Pacific theater during
the war on terror.]{.underline}**

Though the final results of the May 10 elections in the Philippines are
not known, the steps the new government takes will be critical to
ensuring the country's economic and political stability. A critical ally
in the war on terrorism and pivotal to U.S. interests in the region, the
Philippines must continue to build on the important but still fragile
progress made by the Arroyo administration. "The \[new Philippine\]
administration must move quickly to avert a fiscal crisis and to halt
the influx of foreign extremists and the radicalization of Philippine
Muslims that threatens to turn the southern province of Mindanao into a
terrorist hub."

MANILA • **[China has donated four 12m-long boats and 30
rocket-propelled grenade launchers to the Philippines, continuing the
closer relations between the two countries.]{.underline}**

**[The donation, which follows the provision last year of about 6,000
assault rifles and hundreds of sniper rifles, also included small arms
and ammunition, s]{.underline}**aid the Navy spokesman, Commander
Jonathan Zata.

\"**[They are brand new equipment,\" he told reporters, adding that the
military was assessing how to integrate the material and provide
long-term logistical support.]{.underline}**

**[The Chinese rifles went to the Philippine National Police, helping to
fill a shortfall after United States legislators blocked the sale of
about 26,000 M4 rifles to the police in 2016.]{.underline}**

**[The freeze on the sale came amid concerns about the US arming a
police force accused of widespread human rights abuses during President
Rodrigo Duterte\'s fierce war on drugs,]{.underline}** which has killed
thousands of Filipinos.

Mr **[Duterte, who has been critical of the Philippines\' alliance with
the United States, is eager to develop closer trade and political ties
with old foe China.]{.underline}**

**[China\'s donation is part of a new wave of diplomacy to engage a
country with which Beijing has a bitter history of territorial disputes
in the South China Sea.]{.underline}**

Beijing\'s donations so far remain small compared with arms transfers
from the US, a defence treaty ally with the Philippines since the 1950s.
Washington has in the past five years provided 15 billion pesos
(S\$383.7 million) of military aid, including drones, ships,
surveillance planes and assault rifles.

Washington and Manila have for decades held joint exercises, as many as
300 a year, and the programmes remain intact despite repeated threats
last year by Mr Duterte to cancel them and abrogate bilateral defence
pacts.

**[China has donated thousands of guns to Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte to help Manila in its battle against Islamist gunmen who are
holed up in a southern city.]{.underline}**

The small **[shipment of assault and sniper rifles and ammunition is the
first example of Chinese military aid since Duterte threatened to move
away from Manila's traditional ally America and seek Beijing's
support.]{.underline}**

The **[weapons shipment, worth some 50 million yuan (US\$7.35 million)
"highlights the dawn of a new era in Philippine-Chinese
relations]{.underline}**", Duterte said.

**[China has also donated 15 million pesos (US \$300,000) in relief
assistance to help Marawi recover.]{.underline}**

Hours earlier Wednesday, the military said they had found the bodies of
17 civilians killed by the Islamists, self-styled followers of the
Islamic State movement (IS) who have besieged the city of Marawi since
May 23.

Philippine troops, backed by airstrikes and artillery, have battled for
over a month to drive the extremists out of Marawi but the militants
have fought back.

Nearly 400 people have been killed, including 290 militants and 70
troops, according to official figures. Most of Marawi's 200,000
residents have fled and much of the city is in ruins.

"**[We are almost on bended knees sometimes because of lack of
equipment. It is a good thing we have a good friend like China who is
very understanding," Duterte said.]{.underline}**

Duterte has been reluctant to acknowledge American help, saying recently
that he had no knowledge about US technical assistance to the troops
fighting in Marawi.

**[The Philippines, which has a mutual defence treaty with the United
States, has long relied on US-supplied arms.]{.underline}**

**[But in a swipe at America - which has criticised his flagship war on
drugs - Duterte has said he will seek more weapons from China and
Russia]{.underline}**.

Still, earlier this month the US gave the Philippines new weapons after
Duterte complained of receiving "second hand" military equipment.

Chinese ambassador Zhao Jianhua, who formally handed over the weapons,
said a "second batch" of weapons would soon be delivered.

"**[The donation is not big but it is big in the sense that it marks a
new era in relations between our two militaries]{.underline}**," the
ambassador said.

"**[The Chinese side would like to explore the possibility of joint
training, intelligence sharing and joint military exercises in the area
of fighting terrorism,]{.underline}**" he added.

Duterte, who had declared martial law in the southern Philippines due to
the Marawi siege, said he would not lift it until the military and
police said conditions were safe.

The president assured troops on Wednesday that he would protect them
from any legal action if they accidently killed civilians while battling
militants.

Duterte said in a televised speech that troops don't intend to kill
civilians, but they should "not hesitate to engage just because there
are civilians. It is the duty of the civilians to flee or seek cover."

He assured the troops that he would fight to keep them out of prison for
accidental deaths.

"We will face charges, sometimes massacre, you know a bullet hits
through and through, one squeeze of the Armalite (rifle), it bursts out
about three, four. Keep on pressing it," Duterte said.

"And my orders to you, if he carries a gun, he is not a soldier, he is
not a policeman, just kill him. That is my order, because they will kill
us."

The unprecedented militant siege in Marawi has sparked fears that the
Islamic State group is tapping into Muslim unrest in the southern
Philippines to carve out a foothold in Southeast Asia. The U.S. military
deployed a P3 Orion surveillance aircraft to Marawi at the request of
the Philippine military. Australia also plans to deploy two military
surveillance planes.

LARK, Philippines---Vince Dizon makes sure his guests take in the view
from his ninth-story office before they leave. A set of windows looks
out over a hazy, [expansive airfield that was the center of the United
States' largest overseas military base, until it was handed back to the
Philippines in 1991]{.underline}.

The concrete [skeleton of a new commercial-airline terminal can now be
seen in the distance]{.underline}. Dizon, who leads the Philippine
government agency charged with redeveloping old military sites, is fond
of telling visitors that the Americans built a runway of such quality
that the U.S. Space Shuttle could have landed on it.

Three decades on, the area is still dotted with vestiges of Clark Air
Base, where Americans first established a presence during the Spanish
American War while searching for grazing land for their horses. A
manicured veterans cemetery is managed by the U.S. government; a
building that was once a base hospital sits abandoned outside the gates
of a new water park; an American Legion post is wedged between two
"entertainment bars"---the infamous red-light district, which flourished
thanks to demand from U.S. troops, didn't leave when they did.

Now, though, [the Chinese, not the Americans, are the ones fueling
investments here]{.underline}. Officials from Dizon's agency, the
**[Bases Conversion and Development Authority, and China's Gezhouba
Group, an engineering and construction company that has moved
aggressively into foreign markets in recent years, are finalizing the
details of a \$2 billion, 500-hectare industrial park,]{.underline}**
Dizon told me, while Chinese loans will fund a railway linking Clark to
the coastal city of Subic, the site of a former U.S. naval base.
Separately, Chinese firms are also angling to take over a failing
shipyard in Subic.

**[The projects are part of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's
aptly, if not creatively, named "Build Build Build" economic
strateg]{.underline}**y, under which the government plans to transform
the Clark base into a green, disaster-resilient, stand-alone city that
developers hope will relieve pressure on Manila, the perpetually
gridlocked capital some 60 miles south.

Chinese investment in what will be known as New Clark City "is
critical," Dizon said in an interview. "It is how it all started." **[He
sees the investments as symbols of a "newfound friendship and
relationship" between Manila and Beijing]{.underline}**. **[It is one of
several similar projects launched across the Philippines, and across
Southeast Asia, as China and Chinese companies plow money into projects,
largely as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's much-touted Belt and
Road Initiative]{.underline}**. The globe-spanning infrastructure and
investment program has been criticized by Washington, but has
nevertheless won admirers: Last month, Italy became the first major
European economy to join.

This redevelopment of a former symbol of American might here in Clark by
a Chinese developer may be the best example of the shift under way in
Southeast Asia, **[as a more assertive Beijing courts traditional
American allies in a part of the world where Washington's power long
went unchallenged]{.underline}**. "It is so important," Dizon, who
worked on Duterte's presidential campaign in communications and was
appointed to his current job by the president, said. "I think it will be
one of the major legacies of this shift in foreign policy under
President Duterte." \[...\]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [Legislation approved by the]{.underline} U.S.

to make it easier for gun makers to sell weapons]{.underline} like

[The administration's proposal would transfer regulation of some
firearms exports to the Commerce Department from the State Department,
which critics said would lessen oversight of such sales.]{.underline}

"This doesn't prevent or create any new restrictions on arms exports. It
simply protects congressional oversight, protects national security, and
keeps deadly weapons from falling into the hands of drug cartels and
terrorists. I urge its swift passage in the Senate," Democratic U.S.
Representative Norma Torres, who sponsored the amendment, said in a
statement on Tuesday.

While State is primarily concerned about international threats to
stability, Commerce typically focuses more on facilitating trade.

The measure is several steps from becoming law. Now that the

versions of the NDAA, they must come up with a compromise bill that must
pass both chambers and be signed by Trump.

### 2ac---ddr fails

#### DDR [fails]{.underline} -- programs [rarely]{.underline} include strong reintegration assistance and they fail to consult the UN

**Swarbrick 07** -- Peter; ("Avoiding Disarmament Failure: The Critical
Link in DDR" Small Arms Survey. February 2007.
<http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/F-Working-papers/SAS-WP5-DDR-Manual.pdf>)//GK

In theory, [a DDR programme should be included in the text of any peace
or ceasefire agreement on the basis of thorough negotiations
involving]{.underline} not only the parties, but also those
[international organizations]{.underline} (UN, World Bank) likely to
participate in the programme. Moreover, [an ideal DDR programme should
be constructed 'back to front', with **sound reintegration
programmes**]{.underline} well on the way to being in place before the
disarmament event begins. **[This rarely happens.]{.underline}**

Part of the problem is that [those]{.underline} who are [engaged in
negotiations bear less than full responsibility for the implementation
of the signed agreement. It is not uncommon,]{.underline} for instance,
[for the parties to a conflict to draw up, behind closed doors, an
agreement that commits some outside body]{.underline}---often the UN or
the 'international community'---[to providing substantial
assistance]{.underline} and/or resolving the most intractable political
or security problems. [Without consulting the UN, the
parties]{.underline} will then [announce their agreement and present the
international community with a **fait accompli.** This was the case with
the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement for the]{.underline} resolution of the
conflict in the [DRC, where signatories decided to make the UN
responsible for the forced disarmament and repatriation of foreign armed
groups in the DRC---**a responsibility that the UN never
accepted**]{.underline}.3

#### DDR is [ineffective]{.underline} and fuels [conflict]{.underline} -- laundry list of reasons

The [implementation of the DDR programme failed: the security situation
in the north-east prevented disarmament there and not all groups
participated.]{.underline} In addition, [the government and rebels alike
saw DDR **as a source of income**: lists of participating combatants
were overstated and financial aid from international donors
ransacked.]{.underline} For the DDR programme, the [government received
some \$10 millio]{.underline}n at the beginning of 2009 from the five
member states and the central bank of the Communauté économique et
monétaire de l'Afrique central, which the government in turn refused to
deposit into the trust fund managed by the United Nations Development
Programme (US Embassy Bangui, "Rebels Of Opportunity: DDR Unlikely To
Solve The Ills Of The CAR", June 26, 2009; International Crisis Group,
"Central African Republic: Keeping the Dialogue Alive", p. 11).
Furthermore, the reimbursement for firearms turned in was set too high
by the United Nations Development Programme and led to a boost in arms
sales. [Combatants gave up their previous weapons and **bought new
ones**, which were readily **supplied from Chad and Sudan**]{.underline}
(Babette Zoumara and Abdul-Rauf Ibrahim, "Central African Republic:
Genesis of the Crisis in the Central African Republic", Pambazuka News,
January 30, 2014; US Embassy Bangui, "Rebels Of Opportunity").

From the perspective of international donors, the SSR was the primary
conflict resolution tool available to stabilize the situation. But [the
**unwillingness to compromise and the concomitant delays** resulted in
the failure of the SSR to coordinate its implementation with DDR and to
involve the rebels]{.underline} (International Crisis Group, "Central
African Republic: Untangling the Political Dialogue", p. 3;
International Crisis Group, "Central African Republic: Keeping the
Dialogue Alive", p. 12; UN Peacebuilding Commission). In addition,
Bozizé, fearing a military coup, refused to implement the
recommendations of the SSR and prevented the integration of rebels into
the FACA. As a result, the regime was unable to extend its influence
outside Bangui, improve the security situation in the CAR, or offer the
rebels jobs in the FACA as part of their reintegration.

[The lack of funds, inadequate structural prerequisites and absent
sources of income made the reintegration **almost
impossible**]{.underline} (cf.: Human Right Watch, p. 32). [In the long
term, the economic, infrastructure and government conditions also failed
to improve due to a lack of **long-term** rebuilding
programmes]{.underline}. Furthermore, the north remained structurally
disadvantaged. In fact, Séléka's push to Bangui, the downfall of Bozizé
and the formation of the anti-Balaka resulted in further polarization of
society along ethnic lines with increased violence, plundering and
destruction.

Preliminary conclusion

[The lacking will for peace due to **insufficient attention to push and
pull factors** and the lack of **influence of rewards, persuasion and
coercion,** ultimately lead to the failure of the DDR
programme.]{.underline} The resulting lack of willingness to compromise
prevented an immediate disarmament, which was delayed until between the
summer of 2010 and August 2012. During this time, it is estimated that
[only 1,400 (**17.5%**) of the estimated 8,000 combatants were disarmed,
although it is unclear how many then **bought a new
weapon**]{.underline} ("Country Profile 2012: Central African Republic",
The Africa Report, September 10, 2012). The [implementation of the DDR
was inadequate in **every aspect and failed to include all regions and
all of the armed groups.**]{.underline}

**[Although the U.S.-Mexico security partnership is deeper today than
ever before, an overarching strategy to deal with organized crime or
address other issues on the bilateral agenda has been difficult to
discern]{.underline}**. Beyond the provision of equipment,
counter-narcotics cooperation has largely been based on an informal,
case-by-case basis. On the security front, it is unclear how last
Tuesday's announcements will lead to a formal cooperation framework
beyond intelligence sharing.

**[Convening disparate agencies on both sides of the border to work
together will be no easy feat, but coordinating across Mexico's local,
state and federal law enforcement bodies will pose a more significant
challenge]{.underline}**. (The relatively swift success of Plan Colombia
can be attributed to ease of coordination with Colombia's national
police force; Mexico's over 1300 local, state and federal law
enforcement bodies will make the strategy much more difficult to
harmonize and implement).

**[Administrative hurdles and questions about institutional capacity
also abound]{.underline}**. **[Of the \$1.12 billion appropriated for

NGOs---will be better equipped to absorb funds than Mexico's
well-structured security apparatus. **[Many of the state and local
offices and projects that will be recipients of the new
institution-building and community development assistance lack rigorous
methods for implementing programs and measuring their
effects]{.underline}**. The State Department and USAID will need to be
more flexible in disbursing funds and in measuring the effectiveness of
