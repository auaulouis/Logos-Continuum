#### 1. Israel needs funding -- There has been a wave of Palestinian anti-Israel terrorism.

**MFA 5/16** (Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "Wave of terror
2015-2019"
<https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Wave-of-terror-October-2015.aspx>)
NIJ

Forty four months of terror -- 13 September 2015 to the present [**Since
September 2015, Israel has experienced a wave of terror perpetrated by
individuals, many of them very young, inspired by vicious incitement in
Palestinian social and traditional media and urged on by the Palestinian
leadership.** On March 30, 2018 residents of the Gaza Strip began a
series of events that they call the \"Great Return March\". Carefully
planned and led by Hamas, the campaign is actually an excuse for mass
riots at the border between Gaza and Israel, with Hamas activists and
gunmen hiding behind women and children as they try to breach the fence.
Israeli soldiers stationed at the border have been using anti-riot
measures and have been forced to use live fire to prevent the rioters
from violently breaking into Israeli territory and harming Israeli
civilians. If the rioters would succeed in crossing the border, the loss
of life and number of injured on both sides would be far greater than
has been recorded so far.]{.underline} May 2019 update: Terror from Gaza
since the beginning of the \"March of the Return\" demonstrations (March
2018 -- 5 May 2019) Seven killed 282 wounded 1,932 rockets/mortar bombs
841 petrol bombs 25 shootings 128 IEDs 2000 fires ignited by arson
kites/balloons (30 Mar 2018 -- 10 May 2019) 8,648 acres of land damaged
(updated 4 Nov 2018) [The newest form of terrorism is \"arson terror\",
to which the Gazans attach incendiary material and send over the border
to the Israeli side. Since 30 March, about 800 such kites and helium
balloons have been launched (over 600 of them intercepted), causing over
450 fires. To date, more than 2,600 hectares of agricultural fields and
forests (6,424 acres) have been damaged by the fires.]{.underline} The
loss to the farmers is estimated at 7-8 million shekels (about \$2
million). But the real cost is much higher: [the entire eco-system of
the western Negev has been affected. Trees that have stood for
generations -- preventing soil erosion, improving the carbon footprint
and providing a habitat for birds and animals -- have been destroyed.
Experts estimate that it will take decades for the area to
recover.]{.underline} [For a short time in May 2018, the Kerem Shalom
border crossing, which serves as the transfer point for delivering goods
and fuel to residents of the Gaza Strip, was closed due to repeated
attacks by Palestinian rioters, which damaged equipment and fuel lines
-- the only way to bring gasoline and diesel fuel into Gaza. On 8-9
August 2018, more than 150 rockets were launched at Israel from the Gaza
Strip.]{.underline} Two Thai workers were injured, one seriously. A
number of Israeli civilians were injured and some were treated for
panic/anxiety attacks. [On 14 July 2018, about 190 rockets were launched
from the Gaza Strip towards Israel.]{.underline} One rocket fell in the
yard of a house in Sderot, in southern Israel. Four family members were
treated for shrapnel/glass shard injuries. [\"Arson terror\" continues.
Objects such as kites and helium balloons with incendiary material
attached to them, blown by the wind to the Israeli side of the border,
have caused about 1,316 fires since March 30, and thousands of acres of
forests, nature reserves and agricultural lands have been destroyed, at
an estimated cost of \$3 million. Experts estimate that it will take
decades for the area to recover. ​]{.underline} Terror by numbers:​ [Since
October 2015, 83 innocent people have been killed in Palestinian
terrorist attacks and 1282 wounded (including tourists, a foreign worker
and several uninvolved Palestinians). There have been: 204 stabbing
attacks and 154 attempted stabbings; 233 shooting attacks; 74 vehicular
(ramming) attacks; and 394 roadside/pipe bombs (IEDs). In addition,
riots and other types of attacks occur almost daily: rock throwing
(9038); petrol bombs/grenades/arson kites & balloons (2562) Since
October 2015, 1,764 rockets and mortar bombs have been launched from the
Gaza Strip towards Israeli territory, most of them in the past 14
months. According to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorisn
Information Center (ITIC), beginning in September 2015, there has been a
wave of terrorist attacks which began on the Temple Mount and in east
Jerusalem.]{.underline} The attacks later spread to Judea and Samaria
and even crossed the Green Line into Israel under the battle cry of
\"Al-Aqsa mosque is in danger.\" **[The current wave of terrorist
attacks is part of the PA\'s strategy of \"popular resistance\" (i.e.,
popular terrorism) adopted by the PA and Fatah at the Sixth Fatah
conference in August 2009.]{.underline}** Statements by Fatah, Hamas and
PIJ spokespersons have described the attacks as \"heroic actions\" and
\"the natural response to Israel\'s crimes\". **[The terrorist attacks,
which had been concentrated in greater Jerusalem, spread to other
locations in Israel, including Kiryat Gat in the south, Tel Aviv, Afula
in the north, and Gan Shmuel (near Hadera) and Raanana (in the center of
the country).]{.underline}** The attacks have been carried out by young
lone terrorists, most of them from east Jerusalem, and some from Judea
and Samaria. There were also two Israeli Arabs (from Nazareth and Um
el-Fahm), Palestinians staying in Israel illegally, two women and two
children. They were motivated for the most part by the lie spread by the
Palestinian media that Israel allegedly threatened Al-Aqsa mosque, as
well as by the frustration, desperation and anger of the younger
generation. Generally speaking, the terrorists have not been operatives
of any established terrorist organization, and the current wave of
terrorism has not been directed by any organization, but rather is
directly inspired by the intensive incitement accompanying it.
[According to the Israel Security Agency, October 2015 saw the beginning
of a wave of terrorism that has led to 620 attacks (483 in the form of
firebombs) in one month, compared to 223 in September. Eleven people
(one foreign national and 10 Israelis) were killed in terrorist attacks
in October, and 80 were injured, 37 of them moderately or more severely
(one foreign national, 18 Israeli civilians, and 18 members of the
security forces).]{.underline} In November 2015, 10 people (one
Palestinian and 9 Israelis) were killed in terrorist attacks. Among the
non-fatal casualties, 22 were wounded in stabbings (including 5 in
Jerusalem and 10 within Israel), 24 in vehicle attacks, and 12 in
shootings.

#### 2. Arm reductions would change nothing -- Israel still has access to US weapons stored in the area, receive military and intelligence aid, and would be shielded diplomatically.

**Freilich 17** (Charles D., Former Israeli Deputy National Security
Advisor and a Senior Fellow at Harvard University\'s Belfer Center "Can
Israel Survive Without America?" *Survival* 59, no. 4, p. 137-138) NIJ

[Israel]{.underline} apparently [enjoys a de facto US security
guarantee]{.underline}, an important addition to its own deterrent
capabilities at all times, but one which may prove critical in the
future, for example, if the nightmarish -- but possible -- scenario of a
Middle East with multiple nuclear actors emerges. [No other country
would or could address Iran's nuclear programme, a potentially
existential threat for Israel, as the US did, even if there were
eventual differences over the means of doing so. No other country would
have helped Israel build a rocket and missile shield, the only one of
its kind in the world, or have engaged]{.underline} (reportedly) [in
joint offensive cyber operations. The US further provides Israel with a
link to its global satellite missilelaunch surveillance system, which
gives it an invaluable extra few minutes of warning time, enabling
civilians to take shelter, and the IDF to prepare and take
countermeasures. The military relationship]{.underline} also [includes
extensive bilateral exercises, allowing the IDF to learn some of the
most advanced tactics in the world. Some of the exercises have been
multilateral, thereby contributing to the strengthening of Israel's
foreign relations, in some cases with strategic importance. The US has
prepositioned a large store of weapons and munitions in Israel, to which
Israel has partial access]{.underline},5 [and the two countries engage
in a wide variety of counter-terrorism, homeland-security and
counter-proliferation measures.]{.underline} Unequivocal American
support for Israel during the 2006 war in Lebanon made it the first
military confrontation in the history of the Arab--Israeli conflict in
which Israel did not face constraints of 'diplomatic time'. [The US and
Israel conduct unusually close and intensive strategic dialogue and
planning.]{.underline} On the Iranian nuclear programme in particular,
the two countries engaged in a broad, largely unprecedented strategic
conversation for some 20 years. Other issues have included, inter alia,
the Iraqi, Syrian and Libyan programmes for weapons of mass destruction,
the situation in Syria, Hizbullah and Hamas, the Palestinian issue and
much more. [Intelligence cooperation -- an area in which the US also
benefits greatly from the relationship, but which is critical for Israel
-- is broad.]{.underline} On the diplomatic level, too, the US is truly
the indispensable nation for Israel, with no alternative for the
foreseeable future. [The US has used its diplomatic clout in a variety
of international forums to protect Israel from an endless array of
injurious resolutions regarding the peace process, various Israeli
military and diplomatic initiatives and, of particular note, its
purported nuclear capabilities.]{.underline}6 [No other permanent member
of the Security Council would repeatedly use its veto, as the United
States has done, to shield Israel from such resolutions, including
possible sanctions, even over policies with which it has sometimes
disagreed.]{.underline} Between 1954 and 2011, the US vetoed a total of
some 40 one-sided or clearly anti-Israeli resolutions.7

#### 3. Fatalism DA -- Structural settler colonialism flattens Indigenous agency and reproduces a colonial fatalism.

**Macoun 13** -- Researcher @ Indigenous Studies Research Network
(Alissa, "The Ethical Demands of Settler Colonial Theory," *Settler
Colonial Studies*, 3.4)

\*SCT=Settler Colonialism Theory

Despite these powerful contributions, we also identify some important
issues associated with SCT in Australian academic debates about the NT
intervention. The first is a direct consequence of one of SCT's vital
contributions, arising from the theory's present tense iteration of
settler colonialism. [By emphasizing continuities in colonial
relationships between the past and the present, SCT can depict
colonization as structurally inevitable, and can be deployed in ways
that re‐inscribe settler colonialism]{.underline}. We suggest that SCT's
struggle to narrate its own ending can be countered by approaching the
theory as an account of settler desires which makes visible our own
frames of reference. This in turn exposes a range of possibilities and
political visions outside these frames. Such an approach is significant
in countering potentially problematic misuses of SCT that erase its
location as a settler discourse. Such erasures problematically empower
academics to speak with neutral descriptive authority over both settler
and Indigenous realities. Firstly, by disturbing settler colonialism's
narratives of progress, SCT attributes a peculiar suspended temporality
to the settler project. This can portray settler colonialism as an
inevitable structure likely to exist across time -- the fact that the
past persists in the present implies that this past will also persist in
the future. Foundational scholar Patrick Wolfe has been labelled 'very
much a structuralist stuck in a poststructuralist world'.63 As we have
outlined, this structuralism is particularly useful in identifying the
operation of political hierarchies. However, [it can]{.underline} also
[excuse us from]{.underline} human [political action in the present by
presenting this action as futile or already determined]{.underline}.64
[The role of political activists is to wait for the structurally
determined future]{.underline}, and at most to prepare others for its
arrival. The [particular challenge of SCT's analysis is that it does not
give an account of such a transformed future, or of the conditions for
settler colonialism's demise. This can lead to a theoretical and
political **impasse** and result in a kind of colonial **fatalism**.
Such fatalism can be deployed to imply a **moral equivalence** between
different forms of settler political interaction with Indigenous people,
and, at its worst, to **deny the legitimacy of Indigenous
resistances**.]{.underline} Structuralist narratives are able to posit
radical change, but only if this change is built into the structures
they describe -- for example because these structures are subject to
internal contradictions or are inherently unstable. Settler colonial
structures, however, appear as highly stable and 'relatively impervious
to regime change'.65 Therefore, at the same moment settler scholars
finally see the depth and reach of settler colonialism in the present
they feel unable to find 'postsettler colonial passages'.66 This
tendency is reinforced by SCT's capacity to identify significant
commonalities in the objectives of conservative and progressive policy
approaches, as discussed above. It shows that traditional 'decolonizing'
pathways such as treaty making, reconciliation and formal apologies may
also serve colonial ends by absorbing and extinguishing Aboriginal
political difference without disturbing the foundational structures of
settler dominance. As Australian anthropologist Deborah Bird Rose notes,
this makes it 'difficult to offer a critique of the colonizing features
without calling into question the whole decolonizing project'.67 [If
every settler action is framed as always already colonizing, then
individuals are excused from anti‐colonial action]{.underline} in the
present and Indigenous people are destined to be victims of an
unstoppable colonizing state.68 As bell hooks argues in relation to US
race relations, [this is useful to those in a position of dominance: 'so
many White people are eager to believe racism cannot be changed because
internalizing that assumption downplays the issue of accountability. No
responsibility need be taken for not changing something if it is
perceived as immutable.]{.underline}'69 [Is it possible that settlers
are particularly attracted to SCT precisely because it gives us a sense
of being intellectually committed to the end of colonialism while
simultaneously unable to act against our own privilege?]{.underline} As
a recent article concluded about the prospects for decolonization: I can
only assess this with a degree of gloom. I am yet to be convinced that
we can prevent indigenous disadvantage remaining structurally embedded
in society and through the state even after any kind of 'transition' or
'transformation'. At the same time, I fear decolonization. I am myself a
settler, like several of my ancestors before me, and I have nowhere else
to belong.70 [SCT's structuralism may serve these conflicted
interests]{.underline}, in [allowing us to feel we have done all we can
while facing the 'reality' of an inevitable settler colonial
future]{.underline}. [This structuralism gives many within settler
colonial studies a particular orientation towards Indigenous resistance
and scholarship]{.underline}. Australian scholar Tim Rowse argues that
critical settler perspectives on colonialism can 'reproduce that
sorrowing form of attention in which defeat and marginality are
highlighted at the expense of understanding the nature and limits of the
Indigenous agency that circumstances afforded'.71 [He and others suggest
that this sort of analysis caricatures Indigenous responses, presenting
a false binary between resistance/sovereignty and co-optation in the
colonizing process.]{.underline}72 This, [they suggest, leads scholars
to position one sort of Indigenous response as more valid and authentic
than others, re‐performing the authority settlers have always claimed
over definitions of Indigenous reality]{.underline}. Joanne [Barker
identifies a 'troubled focus within settler colonial studies on
structure to the erasure of Indigenous experiences and perspectives
about colonialism even within analyses of the "logic of elimination"
that fuels colonial processes of social formation.]{.underline}'73 SCT
may be revelatory to many settler scholars, but Indigenous people have
been speaking for a long time about colonial continuities based on their
lived experiences.74 Some SCTs have sought to connect with these
discussions and to foreground Indigenous resistance, survival and
agency.75 Others, however, seem to use SCT as a pathway to explain the
colonial encounter without engaging with Indigenous people and
experiences -- either on the grounds that this structural analysis
already conceptually explains Indigenous experience, or because
Indigenous resistance is rendered invisible. In these cases, [the
structuralism of SCT theory can be mobilized to **actively reinforce**
settler colonial authority and to participate in the **attempted erasure
of Indigenous independence**]{.underline}. We argue that Australian
scholar Dirk Moses76 deploys SCT in his analysis of the NT intervention
in ways that clearly demonstrate this potential re‐inscription of
colonial authority.77 Moses, perhaps more than some others, recognizes
the radical implications of settler colonial analysis. He acknowledges
that because 'Australia remains a settler colonial entity,' the
Indigenous 'experience of disintegration is intense ... in the face of a
White settler colony determined to assimilate the "Native" other.
Cultural survival is, then, a pressing issue for Indigenous leaders and
intellectuals'.78 In his recent pieces on contemporary Australian
Indigenous policy, Moses deploys postcolonial and SCT to evaluate the
responses of Indigenous intellectuals and political leaders, leveraging
theory and his status as a settler intellectual to provide an account of
Indigeneity. He seeks to both encompass Indigenous experiences of
colonization and offer an assessment of appropriate Indigenous survival
strategies. Ultimately, Moses uses SCT to argue that, for their own
good, Indigenous people must give up the struggle for survival in order
to release themselves from violence and find freedom and policy agency.
In what Moreton‐Robinson has labelled a form of 'racial
ventriloquism',79 Moses uses the work of African postcolonial theorist
Achille Mbembe to suggest that Aboriginal people should 'inculcate an
ethics of responsibility by recalling, mourning, accepting and
transcending the trauma of colonialism'.80 Moses acknowledges Mbembe is
speaking in a formally decolonized context while Australian Indigenous
people are subject to ongoing colonialism, yet argues that the 'much
discussed crisis of remote communities has led some Indigenous leaders
to abandon the liberation narrative' and therefore the Indigenous
experience in Australia should be considered postcolonial.81 He suggests
that Aboriginal people need to move on psychologically and politically
from colonialism, in effect creating a rupture with the colonial past
and expelling this past from the present. There is a complex slippage
here between the ongoing settler colonial temporality and Indigenous
perceptions of that ongoing temporality. For Moses, political narratives
of liberation presume the past and the present are the same, and
changing these narratives will in itself create a break between the past
and the present: this defensive perspective is indentured to a
particular relationship to time. The traumatic past is the traumatic
present. The colonialism that began in 1788 persists today. Indigenous
people were victims then and they are now ... But if Hart's contention
that the past affects the present is undeniable, Mbembe would ask
whether freedom is thereby compromised.8

#### 4. "Settler" DA -- The framing of situation as "settler" naturalizes occupation.

**Barker 11** (Joanne, Professor of American Indian Studies at San
Francisco State University "Why 'Settler Colonialism' Isn't Exactly
Right"
<https://tequilasovereign.com/2011/02/28/why-settler-colonialism-isnt-exactly-right/>)
NIJ

So [I begin with the etymology of "settler" as a thing or person that
settles within the etymology of "settle" as a thing or person that
"comes to rest," that establishes a "permanent residence."]{.underline}
Fair enough. That would seem to be in line with the important efforts of
scholars like Wolfe, Cavanagh, Veracini, Razack, Jacobs, Ford, and so
many others to figure out the kind of "colonial" structure and social
formation that has been historically articulated through the ascension
of the Nation-State and its usurpation of indigenous sovereignty and
territorial rights through criminal jurisdiction and violent programs of
genocide and child theft. [But "settle" also belongs etymologically to
"reconcile" or "reconciliation," which means to "bring together"
(again), to "make friendly," and to "make consistent."]{.underline} And
[here is where I have troubles with "settler colonialism." Because it
suggests not merely an important set of contingencies within the
historical genocide and dispossession of indigenous peoples, but because
it anticipates a reconciling of those histories within the current
structure and social formation of the nation-state. A nation-state that
is, albeit colonial, but by implication no longer imperialist or
colonialist proper. The nation-state is treated within "settler
colonialism" as having moved beyond its own tragically imperial and
colonial history to be something else, still albeit colonial, but not
quite entirely colonial because it is "reconciled" and
"consistent."]{.underline} I guess [I am wanting to hold onto harsher
terms like "imperialism" and "colonialism" proper to describe the
current relationship]{.underline} of the United States to American
Indians, Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiians, and the indigenous peoples
of its occupied territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. [I think
it is important and necessary to secure indigenous self-determination
and decolonization to hold onto the "empire" in our understanding,
describing, and strategizing ways of empowerment and
revolution.]{.underline}

###  1NC BDS Doesn't Work

#### Sanctions don't work to change behavior -- studies prove 

**Chapkovskii 2018** (Philipp Chapkovskii, PhD Political and Social
Sciences of the European University Institute, \"Collective Sanctions:
An experimental approach\", European University Institute Department of
Political and Social Sciences, September 14 2018,

mmv)

**[Despite the positive evaluation by some policy makers, collective
sanctions do not seem to result in higher levels of group
cooperation]{.underline}**. **[The mechanism of delegation does not work
as it should]{.underline}**. Its failure can be explained by strong
negative feelings against the entire regime of collective sanctions --
the sentiment that an approach that treats the group as one entity is
deeply immoral. **[Another reason why collective sanctions fail may be
found in a wrong incentive structure]{.underline}**. In dynamics across
all 15 rounds the cooperation rate under collective sanctions have been
lower than under individual sanctions. One of the plausible explanations
is the main mechanism that presumably had to drive peers to punish their
team members who do not cooperate, works in the opposite direction.
**[Collective sanctioning sends a mixed signal punishing cooperators
despite their pro-social behavior]{.underline}**. **[Instead of looking
for a cause of their trouble within the group, cooperators start
changing their behavior towards defection]{.underline}**. This feeling
is mostly shared by those who position themselves as trustful. Thus,
**[lacking an institutional justification, collective sanctions might
erode social trust, and, as a result, decrease cooperation instead of
increasing it.]{.underline}** To make collective sanctions work, **[a
greater effort may be needed to make people believe that their use is
fair.]{.underline}** In order to avoid framing effects in the lab, we
used highly neutral wording to describe the collective sanction regime.
We thus applied the, arguably unrealistic, assumption that participants
would need no information on the origin and "justifiedness" of the
specific regime. **[In real-life situations, the introduction of such a
fundamentally unfair regime begs for a certain level of justification
and legitimization. When used in practice, collective sanction regimes
are usually explained by the difficulty of detecting individual
wrongdoers, and the wish to delegate such detection towards their
peers]{.underline}**. That is the way collective sanctions usually work
in school collectives; for example, if no one admits to breaking a
window, the entire class is kept after school. Here, the central
authority tries to change the structure of the costs and benefits of
whistle-blowing. **[Another approach to justifying collective sanctions
is with reference to the guilt of third parties -- a guilt that precedes
the "wrong" action by an actual, individual infringer, and which may be
sees as having caused the later infringement]{.underline}**. The Russian
tsarist government explained their use of collective punishment to
peasant communities for tax evasion of individual members in this
way**[. All peasants of the community are guilty, the logic goes, for
"not trying to convince their fellow to fulfill his duty, when they
observed him giving himself up to negligence and
idleness"]{.underline}** (Brockhaus and Efron 1896 Article
"Frankpledge"). **[Different legitimation discourses may thus have an
effect on the efficiency of collective sanctions]{.underline}**.
Additional studies on the subject will be necessary to study these.

### 1NC BDS Bad

#### Sanctions imposed haphazardly by the US would be perceived as hypocritically and unfair and would result in lash out by Israel -- turns the case 

**Chapkovskii 2018** (Philipp Chapkovskii, PhD Political and Social
Sciences of the European University Institute, \"Collective Sanctions:
An experimental approach\", European University Institute Department of
Political and Social Sciences, September 14 2018,
diana-n.iue.it:8080/bitstream/handle/1814/58424/Chapkovskii_2018_SPS.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,
mmv)

For a start, the rational approach to sanctions -- that sanctions will
always work to move a subject in the desired direction -- has been
attacked on both theoretical and empirical grounds. **[Criminal
propensity theory suspects that punishment is a bad tool to deter crime
because criminals tend to be individuals who are criminally-prone by
nature]{.underline}**. Being impulsive, high risk-taking and
present-oriented, criminals are also the least likely to be deterred
(Wright et al., 2004). Even worse, **[sanctions may not only fail to
prevent crime, but may crowd out prosocial behavior]{.underline}**.
Starting from the 1970s, **[psychologists have explored how rewards and
punishment may in fact undermine the intrinsic motivation for some
socially beneficial actions]{.underline}** (Kruglanski, Friedman, and
Zeevi, 1971). **[The presence of a sanctioning system undermines the
belief of participants that a collective good can be produced without
them]{.underline}** (Mulder et al., 2005). **[Collective sanctions may
also fail because their internal logic harms basic principles of just
sanctions]{.underline}**. These principles are the following: 1)
Sanctions should be fair: there should be a causal chain between
punishment and the wrongdoing; 2) Sanctions should be proportional:
there should be correlation between their size and the size of the harm
the wrongdoing produced; 3) Sanctions should be bounded, or
well-defined: for the specific crime, the size and duration of sanctions
should be known beforehand and finite. **[Collective sanctions do not
perform well on all three dimensions. By definition, the causal chain is
broken between action and counter-action: under collective sanctions
formally non guilty actors bear the burden of punishment]{.underline}**
-- just because they belong to the same group as a wrongdoer.
**[Depending on the specific rules of punishment implementation,
collective sanctions may also fail on proportionality]{.underline}**.
For example, collective sanctions could be additive, meaning that if two
perpetrators are caught, this cause twice the amount of sanctions being
imposed on the group as if one perpetrator was caught. With such a rule,
if the crime rate is high, the amount of punishment received by each
individual member will be disproportionally high. Finally, **[collective
sanctions also lack clear boundaries: if the crime rate is not known,
the amount of sanctioning that an individual agent will receive is also
unknown. Another problem with collective sanctions is that they are
perceived as procedurally unfair, simply because the entire group is
punished for a misdeed and there is no procedure that determines who
specifically is guilty]{.underline}**. To be effective, **[punishment
should be applied in a situation where the object of punishment feels
guilt, otherwise punishment fails to be an effective deterrent or even
provokes counter-punishment]{.underline}** (Hopfensitz and Reuben,
2009). **[Procedural fairness is crucial in raising individual
satisfaction with the outcomes]{.underline}**. This principle has also
been shown in the lab. Even if personally, subjects suffer from a
specific game outcome, they are less upset if they find the process that
resulted in this outcome procedurally fair (Lind and Tyler, 1988; Culnan
and Armstrong, 1999). **[A failure to meet the requirements of fairness
and proportionality undermines the legitimacy of a regime, making it
less effective]{.underline}**. **[Any sanctioning regime consists of an
asymmetric dyadic relation where the active party, the administrator of
sanctions, produces some harmful actions upon the passive
recipients]{.underline}**. **[If the sanction is perceived as unfair,
however, the recipients of the sanction may rebel and cease to cooperate
to signal their disapproval. Indeed, their willingness to send such a
signal may be so strong that they may be ready to incur high costs to do
so]{.underline}**. **[The use of collective sanctions may also be
hampered by a reluctance by the active side in the sanctioning dyad, the
administrator, to actually use them. The administrator may refrain from
imposing sanctions when their fairness is doubtful for several reasons:
moral costs, the expected threat of retribution, and
empathy]{.underline}**. First, there are usually moral costs associated
with controlling and sanctioning others. The questionable legitimacy of
sanctions increases these costs. Second, a person applying supposedly
unfair sanctions may expect retaliation from the recipient. Third, the
administrator may put himself in a recipient's shoes: if he would end up
in a similar situation, he would prefer not to be the object of similar
sanctions.

#### BDS is a propaganda tool meant to alienate and radicalize- they forclose the possibility of reform while polarizing and multiplying violence

**SBDS nd** stopbds.com "Targeted BDS" and Why its a Bad Idea -- Stop
BDS. Stop BDS. http://www.stopbds.com/?page_id=1383. // 7-18-2019 //
Justin

**[Following are ten reasons why this so-called "targeted BDS" is a bad
idea: BDS, at its heart, is a tool designed to win a propaganda war, not
help bring a real peace. It is a blunt weapon of ideological hostility,
not human empathy and engagement. It is neither a genuine response to
the suffering endured by both peoples nor a program designed to address
effectively the complex challenge of improving their lot. Focusing on
BDS in any form weakens other, constructive forms of
engagement]{.underline}** and action that seek to bring Israelis and
Palestinians together. Choosing even partial BDS as policy promotes a
vision which undermines the principles of engagement, tolerance,
dialogue and coexistence and makes it more difficult to establish trust,
mutual awareness and compromise. Despite claims to the contrary, there
are other ways to express concern and opposition to the ongoing Israeli
presence in the territories, if that is a position that someone wishes
to support. The presentation of boycotts as a last resort where all
other measures have failed is a misrepresentation of the opportunities
to impact positively on the story. **[While someone supporting a limited
boycott may think they are not engaging in an act of delegitimization,
BDS proponents use and abuse any kind of BDS activity to claim support
and momentum for their own, full-blown anti-Israel version of the
strategy]{.underline}**. No matter how good the intention may be,
associating with BDS strengthens the delegitimizers who seek Israel's
demise. BDS doesn't address the real sources of the current political
impasse, such as the Palestinian failure to reassure the Israeli public
of the peacefulness of their intentions. **[Punishing Israelis for the
"occupation" may even help entrench maximalist Palestinian claims,
rather than encouraging the necessary moderation needed to reach a fair
political accommodation.]{.underline}** Opponents of the "occupation"
would also have greater credibility within Israel if they dissociated
themselves from the boycott campaign. **[Boycott campaigns by their very
nature are divisive and hurtful. BDS tactics have brought division and
rancor to every institution]{.underline}** (coops, campuses, church
groups and others) **[they have targeted, precisely because the conflict
in the Middle East is a complex one in which both sides have grievances
that must be addressed in direct negotiations. One-sided attacks on
Israel do not resolve Palestinian concerns and ignore Israel's
altogether]{.underline}**. The distinction between Israeli businesses
and communities in the territories and the rest of their compatriots
cannot be applied in practice. **[Any steps to isolate and exclude
Israelis from over the green line would inevitably also isolate and
exclude Israelis from within it. The collective-punishment nature of the
BDS agenda which makes it wrong in general also undermines its validity
in its supposedly more focused version]{.underline}**. The Arab League
has applied a boycott against Israel since 1945 without significantly
harming Israel's economy or coercing it to change its policies. **[A BDS
campaign is also doomed to failure as it will not change Israel's
perception of its fundamental national interests as regards the core
issues of security, borders, Jerusalem, settlements, and refugees.
"Targeted BDS" is easily dismissed by Israelis who see it as
hypocritical, anti-Semitic and/or anti-Israel given that the proponents
express no concern about non-democratic countries]{.underline}**.
"Targeted BDS" won't help the Palestinians achieve their political or
economic goals. In fact, were BDS in the territories to take hold it
would make Palestinian lives worse, by removing the livelihood of tens
of thousands of Palestinian bread-winners, with no viable prospect of
alternative employment anywhere to be seen. **[On the political level,
BDS creates a magnetic attraction for Palestinians away from the
negotiation table and reinforces the view that the way ahead is to run
to supporters in the international community, rather than make tough
decisions inside the negotiating room.]{.underline}**

#### Movements compromise security for vulnerable populations and proliferate anti-semitism

**[There is growing debate about the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions
(BDS) movement against Israel on college campuses and
beyond]{.underline}**. With reports of anti-Semitism on campuses, the
need to address this issue is urgent. **[Here are three critical points
that are often lost. 1. Criticism of Israel doesn't mean
anti-Semitism]{.underline}**. In decades of public life and Jewish and
Israel activism, I have never heard anyone say that criticism of Israel
is itself anti-Semitic. I have written and spoken critically of Israel,
and I have invited critics of Israel's policies---including Reza Aslan
and Hussein Ibish---to speak at my synagogue, without receiving
accusations of anti-Semitism. **[Accusations of anti-Semitism are
sometimes used by flamethrowers to quiet opposition, but no responsible
spokesperson in the Jewish world uses the epithet this way. 2. But
anti-Semitic motivations are part of the movement.]{.underline}** In a
world in which there are few protests on campuses about Russia's
treatment of Ukraine, the Taliban's treatment of women, or ISIS's
history of beheadings, the nation-wide focus on Israel raises some
suspicions. According to a Pew Research Center, there are 49 countries
where Muslims are the majority, 158 countries and territories where
Christians are the majority, and one country where Jews are. Yet
**[Israel is routinely condemned, and the court of common sense offers a
strong verdict that anti-Semitism has something to do with it. This does
not mean that all those who advocate BDS are anti-Semitic. But it does
mean that anti-Semitic motivations are beneath the surface of some
protests, and it is unsurprising that anti-Semitic symbols and tropes
are often found in pro-BDS events. 3. The arguments for BDS don't make
sense. If you say it is because the U.S. gives Israel foreign aid, then
what of Egypt, to which the U.S. gives about \$1.3 billion a year in
aid? Why no big campaigns when about 1,000 people are killed in Rabaa in
a single day? If you say it's to help the Palestinians, then BDS is a
bad tactic because it could hurt the Palestine economy. If you say it's
for democratic reasons, then it's by working within the democratic
process, not by seeking to coerce it, that one gets results. The BDS
campaigns will not and cannot work. When a nation's security is at
stake, making the citizens feel less secure is not a recipe for
compromise]{.underline}**. A nation surrounded by hostile powers is not
moved to negotiate by threats from friends. Boycotts are a blunt tool
dropped into a delicate and ongoing struggle. I am heartbroken over the
decades of pain on both sides of the conflict. But **[the proliferation
of anti-Semitic imagery along with one-sided evaluations of both the
country and the conflict do not advance solutions; they polarize. Groups
on campuses far away debating the issue doesn't help those people in the
region who must learn, together, how to live in peace.]{.underline}**

#### BDS splinters voices fighting for Palestinian human rights and radicalizes Israeli sympathizers- their scholarship is based on overexaggerated media accounts of situations

Ironically, or perhaps tragically, **[those who are most injured by this
are, in fact, those who advocate most strongly for a dovish approach to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]{.underline}**. On the BDS issue, for
example, **[many critics of Israel who are not political extremists feel
suffocated and abused by their more extreme colleagues. When the
American Studies Association announced its boycott of Israeli academics,
Peter Beinart, a prominent critic of the current Israeli government,
wrote that he was deeply troubled by the group, and criticized it for
"denying the legitimacy of a democratic Jewish state, even alongside a
Palestinian one]{.underline}**." Another longtime dove, Leon Wieseltier,
asserted that if the boycott spreads, "scholars would be punished not
because of what they believe---which would be bad enough---but simply
because of who they are based on their nationality.... This is
discrimination pure and simple." And even one of the Times' own regular
columnists, Roger Cohen, recently argued that while he is "a strong
supporter of a two-state peace," he nonetheless can't get behind BDS: I
do not trust the BDS movement. Its stated aim is to end the occupation,
secure "full equality" for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and
fight for the right of return of all Palestinian refugees. The first
objective is essential to Israel's future. The second is laudable. The
third, combined with the second, equals the end of Israel as a Jewish
state. **[This is the hidden agenda of BDS, its unacceptable subterfuge:
beguile, disguise, and suffocate]{.underline}**. Perhaps the most
**[troubling testimony comes from Mira Sucharov, who wrote in The Daily
Beast that "no one loves a liberal Zionist,"]{.underline}** and said
that she is "frequently pummeled" by anti-Israel extremists. "**[The
creepiest example," she wrote, "is when an anti-Zionist website sought
to compare my ethics-based call for a two-state solution to the worst of
Jim Crow proponents in the American segregationist era," a position
actively defended by the activists the New York Times tends to
whitewash]{.underline}**. In addition, Sucharov writes that she supports
a two-state solution, and "for that, boycott-divestment supporters have
been quick to pounce." Indeed, as many have already noted, the
**[Palestinian Authority itself does not support a boycott of Israel,
and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, has said so quite
explicitly]{.underline}**. Even some among the extremists have admitted
that many tactics used by the anti-Israel industry, and BDS in
particular, are counterproductive. Norman Finkelstein, who has accused
Jews of exploiting the Holocaust for their own and Israel's gain, has
nonetheless described the BDS movement as "a hypocritical, dishonest
cult" led by "dishonest gurus" who want to "selectively enforce the law"
by posing as human rights activists. **[Noam Chomsky, who for decades
advocated dismantling Israel in favor of a "binational" state, has said
that any movement that targets Israel alone can be attacked as
anti-Semitic and "unfortunately, this \[characterization\] is with
justice." He has also said that the BDS movement's "hypocrisy rises to
heaven,"]{.underline}** criticizing Barghouti, the movement's founder,
for advocating a full boycott of Israel despite having studied at Tel
Aviv University. **[All this points to the immense importance of the
media's coverage of anti-Israel extremism: By refusing to report
accurately on it, media outlets enable forces that fundamentally oppose
any genuine reconciliation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They
help empower extremists---some too extreme even for their fellow
extremists---who use bullying and sometimes unethical tactics to
marginalize and silence precisely those voices who might help bring
about reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. And more than
anything else, they give hope to those who will never accept a Jewish
state and, in refusing to do so, make peace impossible.]{.underline}**

### XTN -- US Not Key

#### It would be difficult, but Israel would simply manufacture it's own weapons.

[Israel does manufacture (and export) a remarkable variety of munitions
on its own]{.underline}, but these are designed to fulfill unique
operational needs. Otherwise, [there are only three exceptions to its
reliance on weapons systems from the U.S: it produces its own
tanks]{.underline}, albeit equipped with American engines, [and buys
submarines and missile boats from Germany.]{.underline} Moreover, as we
saw earlier, the U.S.-Israel military relationship extends far beyond
the supply of weapons to include the link to the American warning
system, bilateral and trilateral exercises, and even a de-facto security
guarantee. No other country can or would provide Israel with such
capabilities and assurances, and no other country would have helped
Israel build a rocket and missile shield---the only one of its kind in
the world---or (reportedly) engage with Israel in joint offensive cyber
operations. On the diplomatic level, too, there is no alternative to the
United States today. No other permanent member of the Security Council
would repeatedly use its veto to protect Israel from sanctions, or
provide diplomatic cover in virtually all international forums, or even
try to take a balanced position on the peace process. As Israel's
international isolation has grown, its dependence on the U.S. diplomatic
shield has become almost complete. In brief: [economically, were it
forced to, Israel might]{.underline} somehow [tough it out virtually
alone]{.underline} in a globalized world, but [the adjustment would
certainly be difficult]{.underline} and require drastic domestic
changes. Militarily and diplomatically, it would be close to impossible.
No one likes to be reliant on a foreign power, even one as friendly and
well-meaning toward Israel as the United States. This, however, is the
reality, and its implications for policy need to be faced soberly.

###  XTN -- Settler Colonial Theory Bad

#### Binarism DA -- Settler colonialism is a [poor structuring analytic]{.underline} that [forecloses]{.underline} dynamic and contingent relations that elide its binary

**Vimalassery 16** \[Manu, Assistant Professor of American Studies at
Barnard College, Juliana Pegues, Alyosha Goldstein, "On Colonial
Unknowing", Theory & Event, 19(4), \*language modified
https://muse.jhu.edu/article/633283\]

The theorization of "settler colonialism" is indicative of these
tensions. [Activists and academics have increasingly taken up settler
colonialism as an analytic]{.underline} to address the particular ways
in which colonialism operates and persists in places such as Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, as well as
Israel/Palestine. To a considerable extent, much of the work that has
recently become associated with settler colonial studies has already
been underway in Native American and Indigenous studies, as well as
other fields including ethnic studies and colonial discourse studies.
Our contention is that [the]{.underline} particular [ways in which
settler colonialism has assumed predominance as an **analytic** risks
**obscuring** or eliding as much as it does to distinguish significant
features of the present conjuncture]{.underline}.22 Indeed, we suggest
that [when settler colonialism is deployed as a stand-alone analytic
it]{.underline} potentially [reproduces]{.underline} precisely the
effects and [enactments of colonial unknowing]{.underline} that we are
theorizing in this introduction[. Approaches to the analysis of settler
colonialism, as isolated from imperialism and differential modes of
racialization]{.underline}, are consequences of the institutionalization
of this work as a distinct subfield, which is claimed and consolidated
through analytic tendencies that **[foreclose]{.underline}** [or bracket
out interconnections and **relational possibilities**.]{.underline}
Settler colonial histories, conditions, practices, and logics of
dispossession and power must necessarily be understood as relationally
constituted to other modes of imperialism, racial capitalism, and
historical formations of social difference. The [key
insights]{.underline} of settler colonial studies into the particularity
of settlement as a manner of colonial power have also led to a tendency
to [focus on]{.underline} this distinction as constituting [a discrete
and modular form or ensemble of practices]{.underline}--- such as
Patrick Wolfe's often cited contention that "settler colonialism
destroys to replace"23---that can be applied across differences of
geography or time. [As such, settler colonialism appears as a
self-contained type rather than a situatedly specific formation that is
**co-constituted** with other forms and histories of colonialism,
counter-claims, and relations of power]{.underline}. For instance, in
the U.S. context, settler colonialism as a singular manner of
colonialism entirely misses the ways in which the abduction and
enslavement of Africans and their descendants was a colonial practice
that, while changing in its intensities and modes of organization over
time, was co-constitutive of colonialism as a project of settlement
rather than a supplement that demonstrates the taking of land and labor
as distinct endeavors. Wolfe's [description of settler colonialism as a
structure, and not an event, has by now achieved the status of a
truism]{.underline} in analyses of settler colonialism.24 Wolfe's work
has been crucial in bringing further attention to the fact that
colonialism is an ongoing fact of life for indigenous peoples more than
fifty years after the advent of the so-called era of decolonization. His
scholarship insightfully underscored historical continuities in the
shifting regimes and policies of settler states in relation to
indigenous peoples, and challenged a certain produced ignorance about
the "post" colonial character of societies like the U.S., Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand.25 Yet [drawing an **absolute
distinction**]{.underline} [between structure and event,]{.underline}
[and as a result, discarding a focus on]{.underline} the
**[historicity]{.underline}** of settler colonialism, [neglects some of
the ways Wolfe distinguishes between the binary terms structure/event in
the service of further analysis.]{.underline} For example, Wolfe
emphasizes how settler colonialism is a "complex social formation" with
"structural complexity" that emerges through process.26 [When taken up
as a\[n\] modular analytic that travels without regard to the
**specificities**]{.underline} of location [or]{.underline} social and
**[material relations]{.underline}**, [a]{.underline} categorical
event/[structure binary banishes deeply engaged historical knowledge
from the landscape]{.underline}, turning away from historical
materialism, [devolving into a **scholastic debate** over identities and
standpoints that are reduced to structural **essences** and divorced
from]{.underline} [**politics** or **contingency**.]{.underline}
[Emphasizing structure over event also limits the analysis of settler
colonialism]{.underline} itself [into a **descriptive
typology**]{.underline}, orienting our vision narrowly within the
technical perspective of colonial power (in the white Commonwealth
countries), [away from geographies from below, such as a hemispheric
perspective of the Americas, with their multiple and distinct modes of
colonialism]{.underline}, thus replicating the conditions of
unknowing.27 [Foregrounding structure]{.underline} against event might
also [divert attention away from imperialism.]{.underline} This binary
perpetuates taking what Lisa Lowe calls the "colonial divisions of
humanity" as given. Situating this compartmentalization as a consequence
of imperial formations calls attention to how, as Lowe writes, "The
operations that pronounce colonial divisions of humanity---settler
seizure and native removal, slavery and racial dispossession, and
racialized expropriations of many kinds---are imbricated processes, not
sequential events; they are ongoing and continuous in our contemporary
moment, not temporally distinct now as yet concluded."28 If the analytic
project is reduced to naming and delimiting settler colonialism as a
distinct structure of power that exists in specific places, primarily
the settler peripheries of Anglo imperium, we lose focus on the
Caribbean and the Americas as the grounds of modern imperialism,
abdicating the hard-won horizon of anti-imperialism. An emphasis on
structure over event is symptomatic of the stabilization of colonial
unknowing through binaries and schematic modes of thought. As Wolfe
writes, "Territoriality is settler colonialism's specific, irreducible
element."29 However, Wolfe's cartographic model is that of the frontier,
in which "the primary social division was encompassed in the relation
between natives and invaders."30 The frontier is a linear model, a
binary opposition between civilization and savagery, reflecting both a
colonizing subjectivity and its state form. [What socio-spatial
imaginaries, and concomitant critical models, might become]{.underline}
~~visible~~ [if we thought from other spatial forms]{.underline}, such
as circles or spirals, spatial forms that are often more relevant to
indigenous epistemologies than straight lines? If we remapped the
colonial condition through circular or spiraling forms, what new
insights might we gain on the decolonial imperative?¶ For one, [we
might]{.underline} ~~be able to~~ [better grasp colonial, racial, and
imperial simultaneities, as well as positions that do not easily fit
into a settler/native binary]{.underline}. As Wolfe writes,
"Settler-colonists came to stay. In the main, they did not send their
children back to British schools or retire 'home' before old age could
spoil the illusion of their superhumanity. National independence did not
entail their departure."31 Moreover, to inflect these insights through
the lens of negritude produces a considerably more complex set of
possibilities, where the verbs come and stay do not carry any simple or
easily recoverable trace of agency or consent.32 As Iyko Day writes,
"the logic of antiblackness complicates a settler colonial binary framed
around a central Indigenous/settler opposition."33

Today [the world seems profoundly broken. Decades of endemic financial
crisis and stagnant real wages have produced **planetary inequality** of
such magnitude that eight white men now own the same wealth as the
poorest half of the world's population]{.underline} (Oxfam, 2017).
[Seemingly **nihilistic armed conflicts** engulf many
regions]{.underline} of world, [contributing to a reality in which one
in every hundred people on the planet lives as a refugee]{.underline}
(Connor and Krogstad, 2016). [It is now ninety-five percent likely that
temperatures will rise above the two-degree Celsius threshold, making
the most dangerous effects of global climate change largely
inevitable]{.underline} (Raftery et al., 2017). And [this does
not]{.underline} even [include the success of racist, alt-right, and
fascist movements across the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Europe, and elsewhere. All this at a time when governments and
institutions around the world seem completely ill-equipped to even begin
engaging the issues **central to human survival**]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} brave new world is not only profoundly dispiriting,
it [poses]{.underline} very [serious challenges to those whose academic
and political practice involves critically engaging the world with the
aim of crafting the theoretical tools]{.underline} -- or, as Amílcar
Cabral (1979) might suggest, weapons -- [needed to change
it]{.underline}. Today, [the academic workbench of]{.underline}
concepts, [theories, and analysis seems **woefully inadequate**
to]{.underline} honestly [stare into the abyss before us, much less
provide **meaningful guidance** for systemic transformation. One
reason]{.underline} for the considerable gulf between available theories
and present political realities [stems from the fact that much of the
intellectual tradition structuring the academy today was built alongside
imperial]{.underline} or liberal political and [historical
trajectories]{.underline}. Many of the cherished thinkers we draw upon
to construct the contemporary political imaginaries were often
coconspirators in the solidification of the European state system and
Western imperialism. During the twentieth century, theorists engaged in
celebrating a politics of mass demonstration and deliberation, social
movements, democratization, and post-Cold War cosmopolitan civil
society. The theoretical lessons learned from these historical moments
now seem either complicit in, or overly stressed by, the weight of the
current pressures. Similarly, [many of the]{.underline} political and
[theoretical apparatuses used to critique this history pale in the face
of a historical moment that seems to demand a renewed]{.underline}
militancy of [purpose, a willingness to take risks]{.underline} for
justice, [and the **urgent need** for even more vibrant and vital
networks of **human solidarity**]{.underline}. It is not surprising,
therefore, that within the current conjuncture political thinkers in the
Western academy have begun returning to the shelves of the African
anticolonial archive (for example: el-Malik and Kamola, 2017; Phạm and
Shilliam, 2016; el-Malik, 2016). [The twentieth-century struggles
against colonialism in Africa, the African diaspora, and around the
world, seem to once again speak in instructive]{.underline} and
unexpected [ways]{.underline}. There is good reason for this return.
[These voices are poetic yet strident, theoretical but **immediately
practical** to the particularities of struggle. These writings on
colonialism, race, class, violence, and governance **avoid abstract
musing**]{.underline} -- and the polish and perfection of argument that
goes along with it. Instead, [they are timely statements made with great
urgency]{.underline}. The assumed audience of African anticolonial
thought was often not scholars, but rather one's immediate and intimate
comrades. [The horizons of these]{.underline} texts and
[arguments]{.underline} often [contain futures filled with
possibility]{.underline}, even if the specific outlines are not entirely
discernable in the present moment. Several recent books have argued, in
different ways, that [returning to thinkers of African anticolonial
struggle greatly enriches the theoretical understandings and political
struggles of the present]{.underline}. Gary Wilder's Freedom Time:
Negritude, Decolonization, and the Future of the World (2015), Robbie
Shilliam's The Black Pacific: Anti-Colonial Struggles and Oceanic
Connections (2015), and Achille Mbembe's Critique of Black Reason (2017)
all make the compelling argument that [the **ideas**, **concepts**, and
**modes of argument** developed during anticolonial struggles in Africa
and by the African diaspora are uniquely suited to help make sense
of]{.underline} -- [and **intervene into**]{.underline} -- [the present.
Unlike previous debates]{.underline} about 'African philosophy' or the
popular turn towards 'comparative' or 'global' political theory,
[these]{.underline} three [authors neither seek to 'bring' black and
African voices 'into' an academic field; nor do they take anticolonial
thought as **confined** to a location, **limited** to specific set of
'problems']{.underline}, or focused exclusively on the aim of national
independence. [Instead, Wilder, Shilliam, and Mbembe treat the work of
anticolonialism as a **human inheritance**, one that transcends time and
space. Wilder]{.underline}, for example, clearly states that he is less
interested in 'provincializ\[ing\] Europe' than in working to
'deprovincialize Africa and the Antilles' (p. 10). To do so, he [tackles
the]{.underline} political and intellectual [work of]{.underline} Aimé
[Césaire and]{.underline} Léopold Sédar [Senghor in ways that force
attention to their broader commitment to articulating a
post-national]{.underline} (and post-continental) [human politics, as a
radical critique of Western modernity rather than the limited plotting
of]{.underline} national independence or a [black political
identity]{.underline}. Similarly, Shilliam foregrounds the epistemic and
manifest networks through which the liberatory desires embedded within
black power movements and RasTafari spiritual practices circulated among
religious, activist, and youth communities in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and
beyond. [Mbembe]{.underline} also [rejects the compartmentalization of
'Africa' from the world, demonstrating that the racialized practices and
knowledges once used to justify the colonization of Africa have become
**widely generalized beyond race**]{.underline}. The political and
epistemic practices that used 'Black' and 'Africa' as references to
concoct racialized categories have become universalized beyond race.
These authors share a commitment to rereading African peoples,
practices, and thought -- especially as they relate to the refusal of
the Western modern and colonial project -- as central to understanding
the contemporary condition. They contextualize anticolonial thinkers
within their specific conjuncture, while taking care not to reduce their
arguments to these temporal and spatial contexts. [This work
short-circuits the all-to-common assumption that the anticolonial
project is a finished]{.underline} -- [or **largely
failed**]{.underline} -- [project]{.underline}. However, rather than
rebutting such accusations, Wilder's Freedom Time gracefully argues that
such claims are only relevant if one assumes that Césaire and Senghor,
the two protagonists of his book, were primarily concerned with ending
colonial rule within particular geographical spaces. Wilder argues that
[contemporary readers often miss the fact that these]{.underline} two
[thinkers understood their complex intellectual and political projects
as engaged in a wholesale **rebuilding of modern humanity** beyond the
nation-state]{.underline}. As such, the work of Césaire and Senghor
should not be understood through the lens of national independence, but
rather read for the not-yet-realized political visions they contain.
Wilder writes: 'Scholarship long promoted one-sided understandings of
Césaire and Senghor as either essentialist nativists or naïve
humanists...Negritude, whether embraced or criticized, was treated as an
affirmative theory of Africanity rather than a critical theory of
modernity' (p. 8). Wilder argues instead that Césaire and Senghor
actually reject 'the doxa that self-determination required state
sovereignty' and instead proceeded from a position that 'colonial
peoples cannot presume to know a priori which political arrangements
would best allow them to pursue substantive freedom' (p. 2). In this
way, [Césaire and Senghor were intellectuals who lived as complex and
fluid thinkers engaged in a 'pragmatic orientation' that 'was
inseparable from a utopian commitment to political imagination and
anticipatory politics through which they hoped to transcend the very
idea of France, remake the world, and inaugurate a new epoch of human
history']{.underline} (p. 2). This requires understanding Césaire and
Senghor as practicing a form of thinking that is simultaneously
'strategic and principled, gradualist and revolutionary, realist and
vision, timely and untimely' (p. 2). Wilder's book alternates chapters
between Césaire and Senghor, tracing the evolution, exchange, and
collaboration between these two intellectuals, as well as tracing how
their ideas evolved over the course of their engagement with party and
state politics. Reading these texts as already instantiated within a
political terrain makes it possible to grasp their full nuance. For
example, in a chapter on Senghor's African socialism, [Wilder writes
that Senghor 'called neither for France to decolonize Africa nor for
Africa to liberate itself, but for Africans to decolonize
France']{.underline} (p. 214). To this end, [African socialism was not
simply a political platform]{.underline}, or an effort to remake Marxist
theory, [but]{.underline} rather [a way of imagining the world that left
open the possibility that Africans were the **agents of 'planetary
salvation'** and 'human emancipation']{.underline} (p. 215). This
approach helps explain the seemingly quixotic political commitment that
Senghor held concerning regional federalism and his insistence on
maintaining a fraternal relationship between Senegal and France (two
political positions often cited as evidence of his inability to uphold
the true promise of national independence). Instead, Wilder suggests
that thinking 'with Césaire and Senghor' requires us to 'engag\[e\] a
future that might have been'. While the specific conclusions Césaire and
Senghor arrive at might not necessarily 'be applied to our times', 'the
problems they identified' still 'persist', and their 'utopian realist
thinking, at once concrete and world-historical, still resonates' (p.
256). Shilliam's book, The Black Pacific, similarly traces connections
among anticolonial activists and intellectuals across space and time.
However, rather than examining the exchange between Francophone Africa,
France, and the Caribbean, Shilliam locates his study in the dense
relationships between the Māori and Pasifika peoples of Aotearoa (New
Zealand) and the 'children of Legba'. Legba is a reoccurring figure from
African cosmology that mediates the spiritual and physical worlds.
Shilliam opens with the story of a 1979 exchange between Māori elders
and their guests, a black theater troupe and a RasTafari band visiting
Aotearoa NZ from England. The elder, or kaumātua, greeted the visitors,
saying: 'everyone being one people' to which the theater director
replied: 'the ancestors are meeting because we have met' here today (p.
1). This exchange reflects Shilliam's larger argument about the already
existing 'deep, global infrastructure of anti-colonial connectivity' (p.
3). He contrasts these lived and meaningful connections with the
colonial ethnographic mapping practices that sought -- and still seek --
to firmly establish separation between colonial subjects, with a gaze
remained firmly trained on Europe. Shilliam counters by offering a
'decolonial science of "deep relation"' (p. 13) that draws out the
moments of connectivity between the spiritually synchronistic
descendants of Legba, the Pacific Island figure of Tāne/Māui, and the
Arcadian Hermes within the Western philosophical tradition. In doing so,
Shilliam provides evidence of the profound spiritual bonds that ground
relations of strength and connectivity. He argues that, while the
'manifest world is a broadly (post)colonial one, structured through
imperial hierarchies that encourage the one-way transmission of
political authority, social relations and knowledge', there also exists
alongside this world vast 'hinterlands of the spiritual domains' (p.
20). Legba, Tāne/Māui, and the Arcadian Hermes continually assist in
that translation and binding of the manifest and spiritual worlds and,
in doing so, they eschew a 'developmentalist understanding of time' in
favor of one that can account for 'the reparation of ancestral ties' (p.
21). Re-grounding anticolonialism in this shared spiritual inheritance
emphasizes the dense human connections that, through their cultivation,
might inform the healing of colonial wounds. Shilliam demonstrates the
durability of these deep relations in chapters examining the movement
and adaptation of Black Power in Aotearoa NZ, the embrace of the
political concept of blackness among the Māori and Pasifika peoples, the
spiritual and cultural circulation between liberation, RasTafari, and
indigenous Rātana theologies, and the movement of Māori and Pasifika
activists between Ethiopia, South Africa, the Caribbean, and the African
diaspora in England. Unlike Wilder and Shilliam, who locate anticolonial
thinking and practice within the expansive spatial, temporal, and
spiritual realities of specific individuals, [Mbembe's Critique of Black
Reason engages in nothing less than a rewriting of the history of
modernity as the 'mobiliz\[ation\]' of 'Africa and Blackness' with the
goal of 'the fabrication of racial subjects']{.underline} (p. 129). As a
'river with many tributaries', Mbembe's book examines the evolving
nature of race and Blackness within a world in which 'Europe is no
longer the center of gravity' (p. 1). The book moves rapidly and
expansively between theoretical engagements -- with Fanon, Césaire,
Foucault, Arendt, and others -- and the historical events that created
both modernity and racialized partition (the slave trade, the Haitian
and American Revolutions, the Algerian War, and others). He re-casts
'the biography' of the 'assemblage that is Blackness and race' into
'three critical moments': the Atlantic slave trade, the 'birth of
writing' marked by Blacks demanding 'the status of full subjects in the
world of the living' (spanning from the Haitian Revolution, abolition,
African decolonization, American civil right movement, to the
dismantling of apartheid), and concluding with the current period of
'neoliberalism' (p. 3). In this latest period, [we now inhabit an
economic and racial order defined by the 'industries of the Silicon
Valley and digital technology', in which 'time passes quickly', where
workers have been replaced by 'laboring nomads', and 'the tragedy of the
multitude']{.underline} -- [comprising 'superfluous
humanity']{.underline} -- [has become 'that they are unable to be
exploited at all']{.underline} (p. 3). [Within this new epoch, race and
Blackness have taken on new forms such that]{.underline} the [colonial
technologies]{.underline} once developed to separate and manage human
beings according to racialized categories [have now become replaced by a
universalized Blackness that extends beyond race]{.underline}: 'for the
first time in human history, the term "Black" has been generalized. This
new fungiblity, this solubility, institutionalized as a new norm of
existence and expanded to the entire planet, is what I call the Becoming
Black of the world' (p. 6). Islamophobia, for example, operates
according to the traditional logics of racism; however, the
characteristics once used to describe supposedly biological races has
now been applied to '"culture" and "religion"' (p. 7). [While Blackness
has become universalized beyond race, Mbembe argues that the 'Western
consciousness of Blackness' -- which reduces humans to 'a racial subject
and site of savage exteriority' -- has **always existed alongside** the
'Black consciousness of Blackness', namely the articulation of Blackness
within 'a **long history** of radicalism, nourished by struggles for
abolition and against capitalism']{.underline} (pp. 28, 30).
[Blackness]{.underline} therefore [exists within a 'manifest dualism',
both 'the living crypt of capital' through which 'skin has been
transformed into the form and spirit of merchandise', but simultaneously
'the symbol of a conscious desire for life, a force springing
forth]{.underline}, buoyant and plastic, [fully engaged in the act of
creation and capable of living in the midst of several times and several
histories at once']{.underline} (p. 6). [Drawing from]{.underline} these
'reserves of life', and [the]{.underline} awesome [refusal to 'retreat
from humanity' that defines Black life, makes it possible to maintain
the 'possibility of restitution, reparation, and justice']{.underline}
(p. 179). [For Mbembe, whatever our own 'horizons of...struggle' might
be today, the fundamental struggle remains '**how to belong fully** in
this world that is common to all of us, how to pass from the status of
the excluded to the status of the right-holder, how to participate in
the construction]{.underline} and the distribution [of the
world']{.underline} -- [that is, the creation of a 'world in
common']{.underline} (p. 176). Taken together, [these]{.underline} three
books [offer insights into the potential benefits of grounding
contemporary political and theoretical practices within the contours of
African anticolonial thought]{.underline}, widely understood. First, all
three are fundamentally concerned with the question of time and
temporality. [While colonialism is still often studied in a linear
fashion -- representing a break from a pre-colonial past, and eventually
giving way to a post-colonial present]{.underline} (Cooper, 2002, pp.
14--16) -- [these]{.underline} three authors [highlight how emancipatory
conceptions of freedom require tarrying with modernist]{.underline},
developmentalist [conceptions of time]{.underline}. Mbembe points out,
for example, that the 'remembrance among Blacks depend\[s\] to a large
extent on the critique of time...Time is born out of the contingent,
ambiguous, and contradictory relationship that we maintain with things,
with the world, or with the body and its doubles' (p. 121). In Freedom
Time, Wilder examines 'how a given historical epoch many not be
identical with itself and historical tenses may blur and interpenetrate'
(p. 15). [This attention to time and temporality allows the past to
become more malleable and contingent and]{.underline}, thus, the [future
becomes **more open**]{.underline}. Wilder highlights this point,
situating his book within the 'postwar opening' -- a historical moment
that was fluid, contested, and heterodox, existing between 'earlier
moments of epochal transition' (i.e., 1790s--1840) and our 'contemporary
conjuncture' (p. 14). Second, [these]{.underline} three books [demand
that we examine the **relationships** between the possible politics,
economics, and epistemologies within the academy and those demanded by a
still-very-present anticolonial politics]{.underline}. For example,
Shilliam reminds us that [if we aim for 'epistemic justice', then the
'seedbed of such a decolonial project' **cannot 'be found** in academic
discourse but in the **living knowledge traditions** of colonized
peoples']{.underline} (p. 7). If one takes this argument seriously then
both 'personal and institutional' anticolonial practice within the
academy requires acknowledging that even our own 'self-reflexivity' is
not 'a unique product of modernity' but rather an 'institutionally
traditional' form of knowledge, and one that demands that any claim
about the 'superiority of Western academia' be 'radically questioned'
(p. 9). Unlike academic, colonial, and Western sciences, 'decolonial
science cultivates knowledge, it does not produce' knowledge --
production is an act of extending the self, while the cultivation of
knowledge requires that we 'till' in order to 'turn matter around and
fold back on itself so as to rebuild and encourage growth' (p. 24).
[Cultivating knowledge involves planting and tending seeds for the
unexpected, unknown, and **even impossible**]{.underline}. The
decolonial science of deep relations, therefore, engages in the
cultivation of its own 'biotope', involving a 'circulatory' and
'constant oxygenation process', thereby establishing a 'grounding' of
its own (p. 25). Finally, [these]{.underline} three texts [share a
common affirmation of a politics of freedom, of solidarity, and
interconnectedness that is both **extremely fragile yet durable** beyond
imagination]{.underline}. Wilder, Shilliam, and Mbembe insist that
[anticolonial thought and practices are **already embedded within the
present**, and remain part of our human inheritance]{.underline}. They
also suggest that [turning to this body of work makes it possible to
understand political freedom and human emancipation as a project that
remains radically inclusive, spatially expansive, and temporally
heterodox -- both already present, rooted in the past, and always on the
horizon]{.underline}.

##  Framing

###  1NC Frontline

#### 1. Evaluate extinction level scenarios first--- it's the only irreversible impact

**Bostrom, 2** \[Nick, Swedish philosopher at the University of Oxford
known for his work on existential risk, the anthropic principle, human
enhancement ethics, superintelligence risks, the reversal test, and
consequentialism. "Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction
Scenarios and Related Hazards; Published in the Journal of Evolution and
Technology, Vol. 9, No. 1. 2002.
http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html\]

In this paper we shall discuss risks of the sixth category, the one
marked with an X. This is the category of global, terminal risks. I
shall call these existential risks. [Existential risks are distinct from
global endurable risks]{.underline}. Examples of the latter kind
include: threats to the biodiversity of Earth's ecosphere, moderate
global warming, global economic recessions (even major ones), and
possibly stifling cultural or religious eras such as the "dark ages",
even if they encompass the whole global community, provided they are
transitory (though see the section on "Shrieks" below). [To say that a
particular global risk is endurable is evidently not to say that it is
acceptable or not very serious. A world war fought with conventional
weapons or a Nazi−style Reich lasting for a decade would be extremely
horrible events even though they would fall under the rubric of
endurable global risks since humanity could eventually
recover]{.underline}. (On the other hand, they could be a local terminal
risk for many individuals and for persecuted ethnic groups.) I shall use
the following definition of existential risks: [Existential risk -- One
where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth−originating
intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential.
**An existential risk is one where humankind as a whole is imperiled.
Existential disasters have major adverse consequences for the course of
human civilization for all time to come.**]{.underline} The unique
challenge of existential risks Risks in this sixth category are a recent
phenomenon. This is part of the reason why it is useful to distinguish
them from other risks. [We have not evolved mechanisms, either
biologically or culturally, for managing such risks.]{.underline} Our
intuitions and coping strategies have been shaped by our long experience
with risks such as dangerous animals, hostile individuals or tribes,
poisonous foods, automobile accidents, Chernobyl, Bhopal, volcano
eruptions, earthquakes, draughts, World War I, World War II, epidemics
of influenza, smallpox, black plague, and AIDS. [These types of
disasters have occurred many times and our cultural attitudes towards
risk have been shaped by trial−and−error in managing such hazards. But
tragic as such events are to the people immediately affected, in the big
picture of things -- from the perspective of humankind as a whole --
even the worst of these catastrophes are mere ripples on the surface of
the great sea of life. They haven't significantly affected the total
amount of human suffering or happiness or determined the long−term fate
of our species.]{.underline} With the exception of a species−destroying
comet or asteroid impact (an extremely rare occurrence), there were
probably no significant existential risks in human history until the
mid−twentieth century, and certainly none that it was within our power
to do something about. [The first manmade existential risk was the
inaugural detonation of an atomic bomb]{.underline}. At the time, there
was some concern that the explosion might start a runaway chain−reaction
by "igniting" the atmosphere. Although we now know that such an outcome
was physically impossible, it qualifies as an existential risk that was
present at the time. For there to be a risk, given the knowledge and
understanding available, it suffices that there is some subjective
probability of an adverse outcome, even if it later turns out that
objectively there was no chance of something bad happening. If we don't
know whether something is objectively risky or not, then its risky in
the subjective sense. The subjective sense is of course what we must
base our decisions on.\[2\] At any given time we must use our best
current subjective estimate of what the objective risk factors are.\[3\]
[A much greater existential risk emerged with the build−up of nuclear
arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all−out nuclear war was a
possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences
that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and
terminal.]{.underline} There was a real worry among those best
acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear
Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or
permanently destroy human civilization.\[4\] Russia and the US retain
large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation,
either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other
states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a
smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is
not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart
humankind's potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local
terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted[. Unfortunately,
we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are
mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the
21st century. **The special nature of the challenges posed by
existential risks is illustrated by the following points: Our approach
to existential risks cannot be one of trial−and−error. There is no
opportunity to learn from errors. The reactive approach -- see what
happens, limit damages, and learn from experience -- is unworkable.
Rather, we must take a proactive approach. This requires foresight to
anticipate new types of threats and a willingness to take decisive
preventive action and to bear the costs (moral and economic) of such
actions.**]{.underline}

#### 2. Even if predictions are difficult, we still have to make educative predictions to stop catastrophe.

**Garrett, 2012** -- BA from Stanford, PhD from Brandeis University, rom
Director of Strategic Foresight Initiative at the Atlantic Council
(Banning, "In Search of Sand Piles and Butterflies",
<http://www.acus.org/disruptive_change/search-sand-piles-and-butterflies)//BZ>

"Disruptive change" that produces "strategic shocks" has become an
increasing concern for policymakers, shaken by momentous events of the
last couple of decades that were not on their radar screens -- from the
fall of the Berlin Wall and the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the 2008
financial crisis and the "Arab Spring." These were all shocks to the
international system, predictable perhaps in retrospect but predicted by
very few experts or officials on the eve of their occurrence. [This
"failure" to predict specific strategic shocks does not mean we should
abandon efforts to foresee disruptive change or look at all possible
shocks as equally plausible. Most strategic shocks do not "come out of
the blue." We can understand and project long-term global trends and
foresee at least some of their potential effects, including potential
shocks and disruptive change]{.underline}. [We can construct alternative
futures scenarios to envision potential change, including strategic
shock]{.underline}s. Based on trends and scenarios, we [can take actions
to avert possible undesirable outcomes or limit the damage should they
occur. We can also identify potential opportunities or at least more
desirable futures that we seek to seize through policy course
corrections. We should distinguish "strategic shocks" that are
developments that could happen at any time and yet may never
occur]{.underline}. [This would include]{.underline} such plausible
possibilities [as use of a nuclear device by terrorists or the emergence
of an airborne human-to-human virus that could kill
millions.]{.underline} Such possible but not inevitable developments
would not necessarily be the result of worsening long-term trends. Like
possible terrorist attacks, [governments need to try to prepare for such
possible catastrophes though they may never happen.]{.underline} But
there are other potential disruptive changes, including those that
create strategic shocks to the international system, that can result
from identifiable trends that make them more likely in the future---for
example, growing demand for food, water, energy and other resources with
supplies failing to keep pace. [We need to look for the "sand piles"
that the trends are building and are subject to collapse at some point
with an additional but indeterminable additional "grain of sand" and
identify the potential for the sudden appearance of "butterflies" that
might flap their wings and set off hurricanes]{.underline}. Mohamed
Bouazizi, who immolated himself December 17, 2010 in Sidi Bouzid,
Tunisia, was the butterfly who flapped his wings and (with the "force
multiplier" of social media) set off a hurricane that is still blowing
throughout the Middle East. Perhaps the metaphors are mixed, but the
butterfly's delicate flapping destabilized the sand piles (of rising
food prices, unemployed students, corrupt government, etc.) that had
been building in Tunisia, Egypt, and much of the region. The result was
a sudden collapse and disruptive change that has created a strategic
shock that is still producing tremors throughout the region. But the
collapse was due to cumulative effects of identifiable and converging
trends. When and what form change will take may be difficult if not
impossible to foresee, but the likelihood of a tipping point being
reached---that linear continuation of the present into the future is
increasingly unlikely---can be foreseen. Foreseeing the direction of
change and the likelihood of discontinuities, both sudden and
protracted, is thus not beyond our capabilities. While efforts to
understand and project long-term global trends cannot provide accurate
predictions, for example, of the GDPs of China, India, and the United
States in 2030, [looking at economic and GDP growth trends, can provide
insights into a wide range of possible outcomes]{.underline}. For
example, it [is a useful to assess the implications if the GDPs of these
three countries each grew at currently projected average]{.underline}
[rates -- even if one understands that there are many factors that can
and likely will alter their trajectories.]{.underline} The projected
growth trends of the three countries suggest that at some point in the
next few decades, perhaps between 2015 and 2030, China's GDP will
surpass that of the United States. And by adding consideration of the
economic impact of demographic trends (China's aging and India's youth
bulge), there is a possibility that India will surpass both China and
the US, perhaps by 2040 or 2050, to become the world's largest economy.
These potential shifts of economic power from the United States to China
then to India would likely prove strategically disruptive on a global
scale. Although slowly developing, such disruptive change would likely
have an even greater strategic impact than the Arab Spring. The "rise"
of China has already proved strategically disruptive, creating a
potential China-United States regional rivalry in Asia two decades after
Americans fretted about an emerging US conflict with a then-rising Japan
challenging American economic supremacy. [Despite uncertainty
surrounding projections]{.underline}, [foreseeing the
possibility]{.underline} (some would say high likelihood) that China and
then India will replace the United States as the largest global economy
[has near-term policy implications for the U]{.underline}S and Europe.
[The potential long-term shift in economic clout and concomitant shift
in political power and strategic position away from the US and the West
and toward the East has implications for near-term policy
choices.]{.underline} Policymakers could conclude, for example, that the
West should make greater efforts to bring the emerging (or re-emerging)
great powers into close consultation on the "rules of the game" and
global governance as the West's influence in shaping institutions and
behavior is likely to significantly diminish over the next few decades.
[The alternative to finding such a near-term accommodation could be
increasing mutual suspicions and hostility rather than trust and growing
cooperation between rising and established
power]{.underline}s---especially between China and the United
States---[leading to a fragmented, zero-sum world in which major global
challenges like climate change and resource scarcities are not addressed
and conflict over dwindling resources and markets intensifies and even
bleeds into the military realm among the major actors.]{.underline}
Neither of these scenarios may play out, of course. Other global trends
suggest that sometime in the next several decades, the world could
encounter a "hard ceiling" on resources availability and that climate
change could throw the global economy into a tailspin, harming China and
India even more than the United States. In this case, perhaps India and
China would falter economically leading to internal instability and
crises of governance, significantly reducing their rates of economic
growth and their ability to project power and play a significant
international role than might otherwise have been expected. But this
scenario has other implications for policymakers, including dangers
posed to Western interests from "failure" of China and/or India, which
could produce huge strategic shocks to the global system, including a
prolonged economic downturn in the West as well as the East. Thus,
looking at relatively slowly developing trends can provide foresight for
necessary course corrections now to avert catastrophic disruptive change
or prepare to be more resilient if foreseeable but unavoidable shocks
occur. [Policymakers and the public will press for predictions and
criticize government officials and intelligence agencies when momentous
events "catch us by surprise."]{.underline} But unfortunately, as both
Yogi Berra and Neils Bohr are credited with saying, "prediction is very
hard, especially about the future." One can predict with great accuracy
many natural events such as sunrise and the boiling point of water at
sea level. We can rely on the infallible predictability of the laws of
physics to build airplanes and automobiles and iPhones. And we can
calculate with great precision the destruction footprint of a given
nuclear weapon. Yet even physical systems like the weather as they
become more complex, become increasingly difficult and even inherently
impossible to predict with precision. With human behavior, specific
predictions are not just hard, but impossible as uncertainty is inherent
in the human universe[.]{.underline} As futurist Paul Saffo wrote in the
Harvard Business Review in 2007, "prediction is possible only in a world
in which events are preordained and no amount of actions in the present
can influence the future outcome." One cannot know for certain what
actions he or she will take in the future much less the actions of
another person, a group of people or a nation state. [This obvious point
is made to dismiss any idea of trying to "predict" what will occur in
the future with]{.underline} [accuracy, especially the outcomes of the
interplay of many complex factors, including the interaction of human
and natural systems]{.underline}. More broadly, the human future is not
predetermined but rather depends on human choices at every turning
point, cumulatively leading to different alternative outcomes. [This
uncertainty about the future also means the future is amenable to human
choice and leadershi]{.underline}p[. Trends
analyses]{.underline}---[including foreseeing trends leading to
disruptive change---are thus essential to provide individuals,
organizations and political leaders with the strategic foresight to take
steps mitigate the dangers ahead and seize the opportunities for shaping
the human destiny]{.underline}. Peter Schwartz nearly a decade ago
characterized the convergence of trends and disruptive change as
"inevitable surprises." He wrote in Inevitable Surprises that "in the
coming decades [we face many more inevitable surprise]{.underline}s:
major discontinuities in the economic, political and social spheres of
our world, each one changing the 'rules of the game' as its played
today. If anything, there will be more, no fewer, surprises in the
future, and they will all be interconnected. Together, they will lead us
into a world, ten to fifteen years hence, that is fundamentally
different from the one we know today. [Understanding these inevitable
surprises in our future is critical for the decisions we have to make
today .... We may not be able to prevent catastrophe]{.underline}
(although sometimes we can), [but we can certainly increase our ability
to respond, and our ability to see opportunities that we would otherwise
miss."]{.underline}

#### 3. Large impacts should always outweigh small ones---their argument is an example of illogical scope neglect.

**YUDKOWSKY 2006** (Eliezer, Singularity Institute for Artificial
Intelligence, "Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global
risks," forthcoming in *Global Catastrophic Risks*, August 31)

In addition to standard biases, I have personally observed what look
like harmful modes of thinking specific to existential risks. The
Spanish flu of 1918 killed 25-50 million people. World War II killed 60
million people. 107 is the order of the largest catastrophes in
humanity\'s written history. [Substantially larger numbers, such as 500
million deaths, and especially qualitatively different scenarios such as
the extinction of the entire human species, seem to trigger a different
mode of thinking]{.underline} - enter into a \"separate magisterium\".
[People who would never dream of hurting a child hear of an existential
risk, and say, \"Well, maybe the human species doesn\'t really deserve
to survive.\"]{.underline} There is a saying in heuristics and biases
that [people do not evaluate events, but descriptions of
events]{.underline} - what is called [non-extensional reasoning. The
extension of humanity\'s extinction includes the death of yourself, of
your friends, of your family, of your loved ones, of your city, of your
country, of your political fellows. Yet people who would take great
offense at a proposal to wipe the country of Britain from the map, to
kill every member of the Democratic Party in the U.S., to turn the city
of Paris to glass - who would feel still greater horror on hearing the
doctor say that their child had cancer - these people will discuss the
extinction of humanity with perfect calm. \"Extinction of humanity\", as
words on paper, appears in fictional novels, or is discussed in
philosophy books - it belongs to a different context]{.underline} than
the Spanish flu. We evaluate descriptions of events, not extensions of
events. The cliché phrase end of the world invokes the magisterium of
myth and dream, of prophecy and apocalypse, of novels and movies. [The
challenge of existential risks to rationality is that, the catastrophes
being so huge, people snap into a different mode of thinking. Human
deaths are suddenly no longer bad, and detailed predictions suddenly no
longer require any expertise, and whether the story is told with a happy
ending or a sad ending is a matter of personal taste in
stories]{.underline}. But that is only an anecdotal observation of mine.
I thought it better that this essay should focus on mistakes
well-documented in the literature - the general literature of cognitive
psychology, because there is not yet experimental literature specific to
the psychology of existential risks. There should be. In the mathematics
of Bayesian decision theory there is a concept of information value -
the expected utility of knowledge. The value of information emerges from
the value of whatever it is information about; if you double the stakes,
you double the value of information about the stakes. The value of
rational thinking works similarly - the value of performing a
computation that integrates the evidence is calculated much the same way
as the value of the evidence itself. (Good 1952; Horvitz et. al. 1989.)
No more than Albert Szent-Györgyi could multiply the suffering of one
human by a hundred million can I truly understand the value of clear
thinking about global risks. [Scope neglect is the hazard of being a
biological human, running on an analog brain; the brain cannot multiply
by six billion. And the stakes of existential risk extend beyond even
the six billion humans alive today, to all the stars in all the galaxies
that humanity and humanity\'s descendants may some day touch. All that
vast potential hinges on our survival here, now, in the days when the
realm of humankind is a single planet orbiting a single star. I can\'t
feel our future. All I can do is try to defend it]{.underline}.

###  XTN -- Extinction First

#### Extinction is [irreversible]{.underline} but [never inevitable]{.underline}---the neg forwards a pedagogy of [errands against extinction]{.underline} which counters the [core]{.underline} of the modern colonial mission

**Singh, 18**---Associate Professor of English and Women, Gender, and
Sexuality Studies, University of Richmond (Julietta, "Errands for the
Wild," The South Atlantic Quarterly 117:3, July 2018, dml)

[What has this day been for, if its future is **only now**? What kinds
of **pedagogies** might we enact under the **threat** and **fact of
erasure**? How can we teach a pedagogy of extinction that **remains
firmly political**, **hopeful**, **committed to ever-widening communal
formations**?]{.underline} By ["**pedagogy of extinction**"]{.underline}
I mean to signal a tentacular pedagogy --- to borrow from Donna Haraway
(2016) --- that [**will not separate** the teaching-learning of
histories of extinction produced through the **systemic force of
colonization** and its ecological legacies from all those who are
**becoming extinct**]{.underline} in the wake of the Anthropocene [and
the **irreversibility of our collective end**]{.underline}. At the end
of The TimeEaters, the pedagogical errand is confronted by the
extinction of its target. In response to this jam, the pedagogue
determines to teach his alien friend the art of protest (in the form of
letter writing, which feels touchingly retro as it aims toward the
future). [The errand here is an **insistence**, an **unrelenting
pedagogy of hopeful protest in the now**, regardless of **what gets
scheduled for us tomorrow**.]{.underline} Humanimal Projects If the
future in The Time-Eaters is precarious for the alien friend, what is
the future of the human child who is also (always) animal? For Kathryn
Bond Stockton (2009: 5), the figure of the child is "precisely who we
are not and, in fact, never were. It is the act of adults looking back.
It is a ghostly, unreachable fancy, making us wonder." In the poetic
prose collection Humanimal: A Project for Future Children, Bhanu Kapil
(2009) undertakes her "project" for and through the queer historical
animal-child, one for whom the future ultimately comes through other
bodies. As she undertakes this project, Kapil is accompanied by a French
filmmaking crew to West Bengal to research the alleged true story of two
"wolf girls," Amala and Kamala, found living in the wild in 1921 by the
Reverend Joseph Singh. Humanimal upturns history for a future that has
already passed; Kapil's errand into this wild past unfolds the
missionary logic of a wildness that must be forcibly converted. As the
bodies of the wolf girls emerge through this text, they are tangled up
with other bodies --- those of the missionary and Kapil herself --- who
are likewise becoming animal through their accounts of their fantastical
engagements with the wild girls. Humanimal opens with an explicative
passage about the Reverend Singh, the missionary who claimed to have
discovered and captured the wolf girls and later wrote about his work to
civilize them: In the jungle, on a Mission to convert the tribal
population, Singh had heard stories of "two white ghosts" roaming with a
mother wolf and her pack of cubs. He decided to track them. Upon
discovering the "terrible creatures" to be human, he killed the wolves
and brought the children back to his churchrun orphanage, the Home, in
Midnapure. For the next decade, he documented his attempt to teach the
girls language, upright movement, and a moral life. Despite his e¦orts,
Amala died within a year of capture, of nephritis. Kamala lived to be
about sixteen, when she died of TB. (Kapil 2009: x) I'm fascinated here
by Kapil's elucidation of a relay of errands --- a mission within
Singh's mission, that is, the movement from an errand to convert tribal
communities into another adjacent errand that dispels the logic of the
ghost to capture and civilize the wild girls. This second pursuit is a
"sidetrack," an errand that strays from but remains staunchly within the
logic of the first. They are crucially linked by conversion, by a logic
of capture that is at the heart of the colonial mission. Taking up the
missionary's voice, Kapil writes that Singh killed the wolf pack before
capturing one of the girls in a bedsheet: "I cut a hole," Singh states,
"and removed her from the cave" (14). So begins Singh's pedagogy of
conversion, a pedagogy that is also a civilizing cut. And his engagement
with this civilizing errand, this pedagogy of cut, is one that
continuously mimics the very thing it seeks so willfully to convert:
"Accused by an orphan of biting, Kamala is called into Joseph's study
where he bites her back. Beats her with a bamboo wand, then pricks her
in the palm with its tip" (41). Kapil emphasizes the savagery of
civility in capture and its attempt to tame, questioning the line that
separates civility from the wild it so relentlessly desires to control.
Singh's own errand-pursuing body becomes itself errant. Even before he
captures and cuts the girls into civilization, his own body is already
animal, a being whose "hide shivers" as he encroaches on the gendered
bodies of the wolf girls to civilize them (22). My interest is in how
one colonial errand gives rise to the advent of another and in how this
relay might be perverted and redirected toward the decolonial wild.
Kapil's poetic decolonial errand is trans-temporally tentacular: into
Bengal, into history, into the wilderness where the wolf girls may once
have lived, she begins to uproot the grand colonial errand. In
Humanimal, the future child for whom she writes is the wolf child of the
past, a girl whose "new, animal mother" will come (has already come,
will come again) to cross over with her "into the green" (18). And Kapil
herself is as much this wolf girl as she is the one of the past and the
one of the future. She embodies her errand: "To write this, the memoir
of your body, I slip my arms into the sleeves of your shirt. I slip my
arms into yours, to become four-limbed" (15). Constructing memory
becomes a requisite labor of intimacy, a mission against the Mission, a
strategy for messing with time --- reversing and bringing forward the
acts of becoming animal, becoming human, becoming civilized, becoming
hybrid with, as, and for the other. Kapil writes herself into the body
of the historic wolf child and, in so doing, takes on the violence of an
intimate history that has sought forcibly to convert the wild. This is
yet another kind of pedagogy operating in the text that stands fiercely
against the pedagogy of the colonial cut. Kapil's is a self-rendering
pedagogy, a willingness to becoming other-animal, a recognition of the
mythical but no less embodied trace of the animal girl who is in you.
Who is you. Whose own tortured body has also been and is still becoming
yours. Through her journey to Bengal and the writing of her collection,
Kapil undertakes missions against the Mission. Errands against colonial
force. Errands of wild embrace. Wild errands. [From **within the
colonial errand** that we are all living out]{.underline}, Dodge and
Kapil point us --- [from **very different locations** and through
**divergent forms**]{.underline} --- toward how [we might dispatch
**resistant errand-acts** that **create static** in the delivery of the
**almighty colonial message**]{.underline}. If we can conceive of the
colonial errand as a kind of permeating noise, [we might
also]{.underline} follow Michel Serres (2007: 69) in beginning to
[attune ourselves to **other forms of resistant noise** that are also
always sounding]{.underline}: "[There are **always multiple systems at
play**]{.underline}, making noise, [even while we live in a world in
which it **appears that there is only one system**, **one dominant
form**]{.underline} of noise [we have been socialized into]{.underline}
hearing." Dodge and Kapil take up errands that make noise within and
against the false sense of a dominant and dominating sound track. Theirs
are [errands]{.underline} that [bloom]{.underline} through bodyminds [in
ways that **disrupt the cut** and **capture** of the grand colonial
message. Errands that set out **not to deliver already prescribed
messages from on high**, but to **dispatch** and **receive messages**
from the **past** and the **future**, from **this world** and
**others**, through errands that **do not lay claim to globalizing
authority** and **civilizing modes of forced obedience**]{.underline}.
Wild Extinction I am summoning an embodied embrace of strange errand
making, of transmissions that have no precise destination and no claims
to authority, that take up force but refuse its controlled propagation.
Against mastery, I am calling for a wild proliferation of texts and/as
bodies that are radically hybrid, whose lives --- our lives, whoever and
whatever we are --- might be lived in collective friction against the
errands upon which we are founded. I am wandering toward this wild, with
ghosts haunting alongside me, gathering messages from friends and
strangers and running with them as we move with disorientation not into
some wilderness out there, but into and for our own bewildering
surround. I am led back to pedagogies of extinction, toward Halberstam's
sanctuary in the wild and the intimate commitment to staying lost. The
wild errand sutures these possibilities, aiming for a lost sanctuary ---
gathering and distributing messages as we head toward a place we cannot
(yet? ever?) reach. Perhaps it seems ridiculous to point out that [some
of us **have never been extinct before**. The trajectory of the colonial
errand has **delivered us to this breaking point**, to a practice of
consumption **so enormous** that it now **devours itself**.
Our]{.underline} wild [errands]{.underline} will spring from the
disorientations we feel and sanctuaries we build in the shadows of this
colonial force and [will not be acts of **shelter from the fact of
extinction** but will be shelters that **foster a politics of living
into** and **through our messages of refusal**. Into the kind of world
we **won't stop dreaming up** and **stitching together**. The errand is
**act**, is **place**, is **temporality**, is **politics**, is an
**unmapped trail** that is being invented and navigated as it is being
anarchically sounded and overgrown. The colonial errand, **so crucial to
the logic of modernity**, has **run us into our own impending
extinction**. The misfit craft of the wild errand pops up to **confront
this end without surrender**. It does so **without giving up on the work
of justice**, on **forms of redress** for those capitalist errands that
keep being made and delivered against life]{.underline}. The wild errand
is an act of teaching ourselves how to live under and against erasure.
What I am calling wild extinction is, counterintuitively, a profoundly
hopeful politics even while it pronounces its grounded sense that ours
is a perishing life-form. [While the colonial errand]{.underline} into
the wilderness [has **driven some to extinction**, and is still
**delivering others closer to it**, wild errands bloom through the
**cracks** and **fissures** of a **seemingly impermeable concrete
colonialism**. The wild errand is a politics that **mushrooms against
those historically rooted forms** of insidious erranding from
above.]{.underline} In Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing's (2015: 2) beautiful
account of mushrooms that grow in and because of capitalist ruin, she
tells us that "the uncontrolled lives of mushrooms are a gift --- and a
guide --- when the controlled world we thought we had fails." She
reminds us that the mushroom's willingness to emerge in and through
devastation "allows us to explore the ruin that has become our
collective home" (3). [The wild errand is a style of **living together**
into this blasted landscape --- into the settler colony we keep calling
home.]{.underline}

###  XTN -- Predictions Good

#### Even if some predictions prove to be wrong, out-right rejections guarantees inaction and even greater impacts to human security

**James, 2008** \[Patrick, professor of International Relations in the
USC College and director of USC\'s Center for International Studies,
2-16- "For U.S. Foreign Policy, Self-Interest Is Morality", Real Clear
Politics\]

However, it isn\'t just important which way U.S. foreign policy shifts;
it\'s the motivation for movement. [Critics who call for an emphasis
on]{.underline} human rights, [human security or other high-sounding
principles aren\'t thinking far enough ahead]{.underline}. Instead, [the
way forward is a pragmatic building upon the opportunities created by
the wars that]{.underline}, for better or worse, [are already in
progress. This involves identifying the opportunities and pursuing them
on the basis of self-interest rather than abstract moral
principles]{.underline}. As will become apparent[, this approach will
create the greatest good for the most people over the longest period of
time.]{.underline} Why not a politics of morality? The general answer is
that \-- with rare exceptions \-- [it isn\'t obvious what actions are
morally right or wrong at the time they occur]{.underline}.
Soviet-imposed dictatorship and South African apartheid look very bad
today; yet people of good will differed for decades on what precisely to
do about them. [No evidence exists that the best policies will come out
of any particular moral frame of reference]{.underline}, be it
religious, secular progressive or something else. As the saying goes,
[the road to hell is paved with good intentions.]{.underline} Consider,
for example, the lessons to be learned from the Carter administration\'s
emphasis on human rights in foreign policy. One could ask just how much
this policy did to produce more human rights. Remember Iran, the test
case for the Carter team\'s new way of doing things? Three decades
later, we face a leader who is attempting to dismantle nascent democracy
while announcing that his country is free from homosexuality. We might
mention that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad likes to talk about weapons of mass
destruction as well. Of course, the Carter administration has been gone
for a long time, but its petulant [shift from political realism to
idealism end]{.underline}ed [up producing less in the way of human
rights]{.underline} for Iranians than virtually anything that might have
been considered. [The best long-term results]{.underline} in terms of
either the national interest or moral standing [are unlikely to come
about through a foreign policy grounded in idealism. The path toward
human freedom is best pursued by pragmatically making the most of the
opportunities that come along, rather than trying to figure out the
\"right\" thing to do]{.underline}. Was the Iraq war a good idea? The
only sensible answer to give right now is: \"Who knows?\" It could be
decades before the impact of this war is appreciated. What we can do now
is calculate its likely effect on other pressing problems and make the
most of things from the standpoint of America\'s national interest.

#### Turn---rejecting strategic predictions of threats makes them inevitable---decision makers will rely on preconceived conceptions of threat rather than the more qualified predictions of analysts

**Fitzsimmons, 2007** \[Michael, Washington DC defense analyst, "The
Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning", Survival, Winter 06-07,
online\]

But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite
challeng- ing. [If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of
variability in planning factors can exact a significant price on
planning. The complexity presented by great variability strains the
cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision-
makers]{.underline}.15 And even a robust decision-making process
sensitive to cognitive limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of
analysis for breadth as variability and complexity grows. It should
follow, then, that [in planning under conditions of risk, variability in
strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available analytic
and decision processes]{.underline}. Why is this important? What harm
can an imbalance between complexity and cognitive or analytic capacity
in strategic planning bring? Stated simply, [where analysis is silent or
inadequate, the personal beliefs of decision-makers fill the
void.]{.underline} As political scientist Richard Betts found in a study
of strategic sur- prise, [in 'an environment that lacks clarity, abounds
with conflicting data, and allows no time for rigorous assessment of
sources and validity, ambiguity allows intuition or wishfulness to drive
interpretation]{.underline} [\... The greater the ambiguity, the greater
the impact of preconceptions]{.underline}.'16 The decision-making
environment that Betts describes here is one of political-military
crisis, not long-term strategic planning. But [a strategist who sees
uncertainty as the central fact]{.underline} of his environ- ment
[brings upon]{.underline} himself [some of the pathologies of crisis
decision-making]{.underline}. He [invites ambiguity, takes conflicting
data for granted and substitutes a priori scepticism about the validity
of prediction]{.underline} for time pressure [as a rationale for
discounting the importance of analytic rigour]{.underline}. It is
important not to exaggerate the extent to which data and 'rigorous
assessment' can illuminate strategic choices. Ambiguity is a fact of
life, and scepticism of analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the
intuition and judgement of decision-makers will always be vital to
strategy, and attempting to subordinate those factors to some formulaic,
deterministic decision-making model would be both undesirable and
unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the opposite extreme as
well. [Without careful analysis of what is relatively likely and what is
relatively unlikely, what will be the possible bases for strategic
choices?]{.underline} [A decision-maker with no faith in prediction is
left with little more than]{.underline} a set of worst-case scenarios
and his [existing beliefs about the world]{.underline} to confront the
choices before him. [Those beliefs may be more or less well founded, but
if they are not made explicit and subject to analysis and debate
regarding their application to particular strategic contexts, they
remain only beliefs and premises, rather than rational judgements. Even
at their best, such decisions are likely to be poorly understood by the
organisations charged with their implementation.]{.underline} At their
worst, such decisions may be poorly understood by the decision-makers
themselves.

#  Topicality

## Framework

### 1NC

#### Interpretation and Violation: the affirmative team should defend the fiated implementation of a policy action to substantially reduce Direct Commercial Sales and/or Foreign Military Sales of arms -- they don't meet because they don't defend a fiated action 

#### United States federal government means the three branches

**OECD 87** --- Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
Council, 1987 ("United States," *The Control and Management of
Government Expenditure*, p. 179)

1\. **[Political and organisational structure of
government]{.underline}**

**[The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50
states]{.underline}**. States have their own constitutions and within
each State there are at least two additional levels of government,
generally designated as counties and cities, towns or villages. The
relationships between different levels of government are complex and
varied (see Section B for more information).

**[The Federal Government is composed of three branches: the legislative
branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch]{.underline}**.
Budgetary decisionmaking is shared primarily by the legislative and
executive branches. The general structure of these two branches relative
to budget formulation and execution is as follows.

#### The [text of the resolution]{.underline} calls for debate on hypothetical government action

**Ericson 3** (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts --
California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater's Guide, Third Edition,
p. 4)

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
**[each topic contains certain key elements]{.underline}**, although
they have slightly different functions from comparable elements of
value-oriented propositions[. 1. **An agent doing the acting \-\--"The
United States" in "The United States should** adopt]{.underline} a
policy of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of
value, **[the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb
should]{.underline}**---the first part of a verb phrase **[that urges
action]{.underline}**. 3. An action verb to follow should in the
should-verb combination. [**For example, should** **adopt**]{.underline}
here **[means to put a]{.underline}** program or **[policy into action
though governmental means]{.underline}**. 4. A specification of
directions or a limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade,
for example, gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for
example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing
diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions
of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. [**The
entire debate is about whether something ought to occur**.]{.underline}
What you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such
a debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience
to perform the future action that you propose.

#### Vote neg:

#### Predictable Limits -- the resolution guides preparation -- changing it manipulates a careful balance of aff and neg ground -- anything outside the scope of the topic results in teams reaching for the moral high ground and prevents in depth engagement

#### Ground -- advocacy statements are not federal action and don't have disad literature -- even if we had ground in this debate, it was not predictable -- it's not a question of what happened in this debate, but rather how much ground their model of debate allows for

#### And debate is a game, it may have educational benefits, but it is structured by wins and losses. Unlimiting the topic disincentivizes participation and motivated learning. A balanced game where [both]{.underline} sides have an [equal opportunity]{.underline} to access the ballot is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to the game itself.

#### Setting the point of contestation and limiting the topic is key to creating a meaningful discussion within the debate space -- there are 3 impacts:

#### Procedural fairness is its own impact -- fairness is the structuring condition that incentivizes teams to go do research and allows for debate to function in a competitive manner -- if every debate came down to whoever the judge liked better, there would be no value to participation -- creating an equal ability to access the ballot is good even if there are outside factors and structural inequalities that determine how we are situated within debate

#### Clash and contestation has intrinsic value -- the process of debating facilitates reaching nuances of their literature and forces us to become effective advocates in the real world by building a culture of [justification]{.underline} and not [presumption]{.underline} -- affs that are able to say that certain discourses are bad result in [running to truth claims]{.underline} which is [impossible to negate]{.underline}

#### Topic education is necessary to understand the intricacies of arms sales - informed clash in policy debates is key to increase transparency, demand accountability, and create effective advocates

**Holden 16** -- historian, researcher, and director of investigations
at Corruption Watch UK (Paul, Indefensible: Seven Myths that Sustain the
Global Arms Trade, p. 174, lasa-SI)

This is a problem of enormous proportion, well-funded and powerful, with
deep historical and institutional roots. Faced with this seemingly
overwhelming advantage, it is easy to fall into apathy or despair. What,
after all, can an individual do to change a systemic problem?

Not much. But **[we are not merely individuals. We are the beginning of
an international network that will share innovation, resources and
practices to make defense industry players conform to basic standards of
accountability and openness, and ensure governments allocate funds to
defense (or to alternative sectors) in ways that meet the real needs of
their citizens.]{.underline}**

So how do we get there? There is not going to be a tidy checklist. There
are a lot of things that need to be changed. This is how we get started:

*First, learn to recognize the myths and dispute them.* Stop engaging in
the mythology of the arms business. **[The first step in this process is
to generate an informed public debate about the global arms industry,
its business model and practices, and its stated
justifications.]{.underline}**

*Second, several of the myths point us in the direction of seeking
long-term, sustainable approaches to security,* rather than panic-driven
kneejerk responses. They suggest a different set of questions to guide
policy: how are today's threats different from past threats and what
does this mean for our countries' needs, and our world's needs?

Knowing that weapons, allies and contexts are unstable and that weapons
control regimes are inadequate, we should ask: what are the long-term
consequences of today's deals? Spending does not necessarily lead to
security; and worse, spending on defense can divert public funds away
from more effective uses. If we need to create jobs and stimulate the
economy, that concern should take precedence; but we should look to
other sectors that create more jobs, and more civilian technology, than
defense.

The question to start with should be: What is the most effective use of
public funds to increase sustainable human security?

*Third,* **[demand transparency.]{.underline}** Partisan economic and
political interests, not concern with public security, often dominate
arms trade decisions.

**[Transparency is the best way to combat this tendency. Demand it not
only within your own government, but also in how your government and
private corporations engage in security sector assistance and arms deals
with foreign countries.]{.underline}** National security does not
require secrecy. **[The greatest security a country can experience is
through transparent and accountable democratic practices.]{.underline}**
There may be need for some secrecy, but it should always be the
exception and never be used to hide improper influence, misbehavior or
grand larceny. **[Support groups in other countries that are also
advocating for transparency and find ways to work together at the
intersection of trade deals. Take a look at the Stop the Shipment
campaign for inspiration: it is a campaign that attempted, through
putting pressure on various governments and international organizations,
to stop a contemporaneous shipment of tear gas to the notoriously
repressive Bahraini regime.]{.underline}**

*Fourth,* **[demand accountability]{.underline}***.* Corruption is
endemic to the trade; it is a problem for every society that engages in
arms transactions, producers and purchasers alike.

Some countries have good laws to govern corruption and accountability;
make sure they are being applied. Support whistle-blowing that reveals
corruption and overreach. The levers of accountability as they currently
exist in even the most law-governed countries are insufficient, a fact
that is proven time and again when oversight functions as a rubber
stamp. Whistleblowers risk their livelihoods and freedom to expose this
fact and deserve our support.

*Fifth,* **[following the leadership of local advocates, we can act in
solidarity with each other. There will be specific strategies, need and
avenues for engagement that makes sense for different
contexts.]{.underline}** For instance, in the US, pressuring Congress to
commit to return military spending to pre-911 levels and demanding
increased, rather than decreased, regulation of the trade would have
major impact. In Nigeria, the place to start may be budget transparency
and an end to 'security votes'. In many countries, enabling the voice of
civil society to criticize and oversee the defense sector is the first
crucial step.

**[Together, we can foster an evidence-driven, accountable and
transparent public discussion of the global arms business. Together, we
can start pointing out the absurdities that protect a business to the
detriment of the security and economic prosperity of the world. By doing
so, we can make the world a safer, more prosperous and more harmonious
place.]{.underline}**

International military sales are on the rise. While the United States
and European Union are cutting their defense expenditures, several
countries---particularly in East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and
South America---are increasing expenditures. **[Hence, U.S. Contractors
are increasingly seeking to sell products and services to these markets.
There are two primary methods for doing so: government-to-government
sales through the U.S. Government's Foreign Military Sales ("FMS")
program]{.underline}** and similar mechanisms, **[and Direct Commercial
Sales ("DCS") negotiated directly between the contractor and the foreign
customer]{.underline}**. Both methods have existed for decades, but a
novice to international sales has a steep learning curve regarding the
complexities of each.

#### Violation -- the aff results in a total embargo of military support to Israel, at best that is extra T -- Extra T is a voting issue -- explodes limits and gives the aff access to unpredictable 2AC offense 

#### Limits -- allowing any type of military aid aff explodes the topic and makes anything tangentially related to arms topical -- makes it impossible to be negative as there is no stable area for the negative to prepare for 

#### Ground -- ending more than FMS and DCS allows the aff to fiat out of key negative solvency deficits and links to trade off and circumvention disads

Mass. 1905.  Rev.Laws, c.203, § 9, provides that, if two or more cases
are tried together in the superior court, the presiding judge may
"reduce" the witness fees and other costs, but "not less than the
ordinary witness fees, and other costs recoverable in one of the cases"
which are so tried together shall be allowed.  Held that, in reducing
the costs, the amount in all the cases together is to be considered and
reduced, providing that there must be left in the aggregate an amount
not less than the largest sum recoverable in any of the cases.  [The
word "reduce," in its ordinary signification, does not mean to cancel,
destroy, or bring to naught, but to diminish, lower, or bring to an
inferior state.---]{.underline}Green v. Sklar, 74 N.E. 595,

#### Violation---the ends all sale of arms, it doesn't reduce them.

#### Vote neg--- 2 reasons:

#### 1. Ground -- No literature exists to make case negs for ending all arm sales, that makes it possible to create well-prepared negative arguments. Even if ground is predictable, it's inevitably skewed in favor of the affirmative.

#### 2. Precision -- Including "eliminate" skews predictable negative ground and takes out competitive counterplans, reducing negatives to generic PICs. This creates the worst forms of debate that dodges core topical discussion.

#### Topicality is procedural, prefer competing-interpretations.

**[Such a regime provides citizens belonging to a particular group with
"incentives to regulate one another's behavior," thus enforcing norm
compliance and creating a social context in which a wrongdoing
individual turns his entire group into a group of wrongdoers as
well]{.underline}**. For it is to be clear that when dealing with
others, a corrupt individual "never stands alone" (Heckathorn 1988:
535--536). **[This constitutes a form of "modified vendetta" which
recalls ancient tribal and group notions of informal and 'unofficial'
control and retaliation against aberrant behavior by an individual(s)
belonging to a collective]{.underline}**, as well as injury by
'outsiders'(Shipp 1987: 606). **[Advocates of individual responsibility,
to whom group punishment is perceived as a "primitive"]{.underline}**
and "disreputable atavism of premodern, communalist cultures," as
"anachronistic" as "punishing the innocent is immoral," **[may strongly
oppose the idea]{.underline}** (Levinson 2003). This would tend to
confine possible approaches to linear perspectives despite the need of
applying non-linear tools to ill-structured or wicked problems such as
pervasive corruption. **[Tools should be evaluated in relation to their
"utility" not their "novelty," as they exist for the benefit of the
citizens not the other way round]{.underline}** (Rigby 1993: 15).
**[Yet, despite Levinson's]{.underline}** (2003) **[interesting study
justifying the principle of collective sanctions, he seemed constrained
by the limitations of linearity]{.underline}**. Levinson (ibid: 6) felt
obliged to speak in the language of a "forward-looking, functional
perspective" perhaps in order to avoid perceptions of being backward
looking and therefore adopting some form of a non-linear approach.
**[This however, need not be necessary in general, but particularly when
dealing with pervasive corruption in societies where the idea of the
collective is not strange to their culture and ethical
values]{.underline}**. **[In many of these societies, members can
readily accept the notion of collective responsibility to an act
committed by an individual within the group]{.underline}**. Levinson
(2003: 5) **[suggests a strategy of "delegated deterrence" as an
alternative conception by which the \"responsibility for deterring
individual wrongdoers is effectively delegated by an external sanctioner
to a group that is well-situated to implement an efficient regulatory
regimen]{.underline}**". This is a form of an "informal monitoring"
mechanism or tool, delegating the monitoring of individual members to
the group. **[Internal informal monitoring is believed to be much more
effective than formal monitoring by an external agent]{.underline}**
(Heckathorn 1988: 538), **[as it becomes a form of
self-policing]{.underline}**. Sanctions, deterrence and interdependency
**[Collective sanctions and delegated deterrence are not the same, even
if they overlap and their differences remain quite subtle. Collective
sanctions create a condition designated by Lewin as "interdependence of
fate," where a heterogeneous group comes to form a psychological
construct]{.underline}**, not because of any particular similarities
among its members, **[but due to a feeling of a common fate, or due to a
strong sense that the fate of each member as well as that of the group
is interdependent]{.underline}**. The stronger the interdependence of
fate, the more an individual would be expected to contribute to the
group's welfare. **[Delegated deterrence, in turn, strengthens this
relation by creating "task interdependence" or common goals and
objectives among a group of possibly diverse members]{.underline}**.
(Smith 2001: 2--3.) **[Both tools link the group members' task and fate
in such a way that if the group as a whole fails to perform the task of
monitoring and policing corruption among itself, all members are
punishable.]{.underline}** "\[N\]ot because they are deemed collectively
responsible for wrongdoing but simply because they are in an
advantageous position to identify, monitor, and control responsible
individuals -- and can be motivated by the threat of sanctions to do so"
(Levinson 2003: 4). **[If and when such a mechanism does in fact produce
a new equilibrium of norm compliance, the external agent can eventually
establish significant influence over group behavior as both formal and
informal regimes of control buttress each other]{.underline}**
(Heckathorn 1988: 538--539). **[It is possible however, that members of
the entire group would choose to 'rebel' and decide that all of them
would take bribes]{.underline}**. **[Since they are all culprits, the
assumption is that no one will have an incentive to bear the risk or
responsibility of exposing the activity]{.underline}**. This situation
can, however, be turned into an opportunity. For one thing, if all
engage in taking bribes, such a group activity would become more visible
and discernable to 'integrity' agencies as well as their network of
informants, thus reducing the costs and demands of monitoring. **[In
addition, it should be made clear that collective culpability and/or
connivance would lead to ratcheting punishment up not down, given that
as citizens they have failed to perform their collective
task]{.underline}**. There is no room here for pointing the finger of
blame toward somebody else. **[Reporting a person who takes bribes
becomes simply an act of self-preservation as well as self-defense given
that such a person who chooses to commit this act has at the same time
chosen to jeopardize the welfare of those working with
him]{.underline}**. In this case, he has already committed a threatening
and detrimental act to all others, the entire group, or the colleagues
in the bureau. He has broken the code of interdependency. Thus, **[when
one or more members of the group reports the corrupt activities of a
coworker to a supervisory agency, this individual is not to be perceived
necessarily as a 'whistleblower' in the strict sense of the
word]{.underline}**.6 Knowing this is important in minimizing

**[Bribery, as a representation of structural, pervasive and endemic
corruption, is wicked both ethically and as a problem seeking a
re-solution]{.underline}**. **[The global explosion in this
phenomenon]{.underline}**, which underlies much of all other forms of
wrongdoing, **[has rendered it a form of "routine" cultural practice
generating a state of "banality of wrongdoing".]{.underline}** A
constructed environment, where cultural 'blinders' as well as
"blindness" to ethical alternatives is set, in order to prohibit or
constrain any possible questioning of the morality of 'cultural
practices' of the kind (Moody-Adams 1994: 298, 294). **[The fact that
corruption is contagious and capable of producing an intricate network
of interests, spanning all class distinctions and economic variations,
'freezing' them into a self-consolidating complex environmental and
cultural setting, makes any attempt to reverse this pattern risky and
extremely complicated]{.underline}**. Particularly so, when corrupt
political, administrative and governmental systems are major causes as
well as effects of such a wicked outcome. **[Both formal and informal
forces and structures are at play as the entire society becomes enmeshed
in the vicious circle of corruption. State capture not only reflects
high level corruption up the hierarchical echelons, but also the state
as a producer of corruption, or the corruptor state, in response to
demands of transnational capital flows]{.underline}**, **[with serious
economic and political implications]{.underline}**. Administrative
corruption in turn constitutes the lower level mirror image with
additional negative social implications. The connective hierarchy of
corruption which represents the wickedness of the problem goes something
like the following: global capital flow demands Æ administrative and
organizational corruption Æ domestic state capture Æ corrupt identity Æ
corrupt society Æ insane society. **[Governance institutionalizes all
those aspects of ethical decay into a 'frozen' framework -- a norm. To
attempt to break the vicious circle of corruption, the very concept of
governance need be recognized, if not as part of the problem, then at
least not the one best representation of it]{.underline}**. The focus in
this chapter on the administrative manifestations of the dilemma is made
for the purposes of analytical parsimony, despite the acknowledged
shortcomings of such a method in dealing with a mess of this nature.
**[I have tried, therefore, to develop a measure of form or structure to
the problem by suggesting a possible comparison of policies adopted by
many regimes to depoliticize their societies and to control political
action, and refocus such policies instead on de-corrupting or
'unfreezing' strategies that help break
path-dependencies]{.underline}**. In many ways, corruption is similar to
politics or to a political situation. A comparison with politics, with
its different degrees of failures and successes, may allow for learning
from actual experience. **[The characteristic resilience and complexity
of political gaming between protagonist and antagonist groups is
relevant to the equivalent characteristics of corruption]{.underline}**.
Like politics, it is an expression of power and interests, taken to the
extreme, unconstrained by moral, ethical, or legal considerations. It is
also a form of base violence, deprived of any of the virtues of war as
the continuation of politics by other means -- to paraphrase Carl von
Clausewitz. An institutionally corrupt society, in other words, is a
society at war with itself against itself -- a subverted and therefore
insane society. **[Like a political process, corruption is a resilient
phenomenon that at best may be resolved, not solved]{.underline}**.
Thus, I have attempted not to lose sight of a main constraint of dealing
with a wicked or ill-structured problem, and that is not to be overly
ambitious about what can be accomplished. **[Attempts at a 'rational'
approach to problem solving may not be of much help, as it is very
difficult to delineate all strategic options or novel tools and then
choose the most appropriate]{.underline}**. This is so as not much
confidence in the representation of the problem is possible from the
outset, nor can the outcomes and consequences of any proposed
re-solutions or strategies be initially anticipated. For in a wicked
setting any response is very likely to change the nature of the problem
(Camillus 2008: 104); the type of resilience capable of making a
comeback even if in a different form. The alternative is to simply
"experiment" with any number of feasible strategies or re-solutions
despite uncertainty about what may in fact transpire (ibid.); a form of
action learning, consistent with Kurt Lewin's aphorism "if you want
truly to understand something, try to change it". In choosing tools one
need not be constrained by their novelty -- i.e. linearity.
Experimenting with older or ancient wisdom is not necessarily a vice. As
a form of 'experimentation,' I have suggested collective responsibility
and **[collective sanctions/punishment]{.underline}** as potentially
relevant and effective tools and mechanisms of citizen corruption
control. This is particularly so when efficient formal monitoring is
inadequate, for whatever reasons, and **[needs to be complemented with
some form of "mandatory self-policing"]{.underline}** (Feinberg 1968:
681). They are relevant because in societies with endemic corruption, a
collective phenomenon of the kind necessitates a collective rather than
a mere individual case by case approach.

#### Settler colonial theory overfocuses on the settler/native binary which not only decenters class, but ignores the potential for anti-capitalist linkages that exist.

**Locker-Biletzki 18** (Amir, Associated Researcher at the Azrieli
Institute of Israel Studies at Concordia University in Montreal
"Rethinking Settler Colonialism: A Marxist Critique of Gershon Shafir"
*Rethinking Marxism* 30, no. 3, pp. 457-458) NIJ

Settler-colonial theory is a materialist theory with intellectual roots
in the Marxist tradition. However, **[settler-colonial theorists'
reconstruction of historical realities in settler societies tends to
disregard the socially varied processes of class formation and the
development of capitalist regimes. For settler-colonial scholars, the
colonizer/colonized dichotomy overshadows the proletariat/bourgeoisie
dichotomy.]{.underline}** This is evident in the pioneering work of
Gershon Shafir. His rendition of the origins of Israeli society is based
on a materialist view of the way Jewish workers effected the building of
a pure colony. [An analysis of the history of the formation of class
among Palestinians and Jews alike shows that]{.underline}, while it did
not comply with a Marxist-inspired European model, [where labor
confronted the political control of capital, the bourgeois class did
evolve and]{.underline} to an extent [engaged in antagonistic relations
with the laboring class. These developments largely corresponded with
the settler-colonial divide]{.underline} that Shafir portrays, [meaning
that Jewish workers and Arab workers as well as Jewish and Arab
capitalists generally did not form any major interclass alliances beyond
the national dividing lines.]{.underline} However, [**one
cannot**]{.underline} entirely [**dismiss the history of Palestinian and
Jewish cooperation in the citrus groves and in the joint struggles of
workers from both peoples in the governmental sector of Palestine's
economy.** While this may not have been the main tendency]{.underline}
in a society that was shaped by a drive to categorize and separate Arabs
from Jews, [it nonetheless lends nuance to the largely monochromatic
picture that Shafir paints of the history of Palestine/ Israel. The
reclaiming of this counterhistory and the use of Marxism to interpret it
within settler-colonial discourse serves to enhance and enrich our view
of the history of Palestine/Israel.]{.underline} This rewriting of the
colonial history of the country also includes a reclaiming of the
Marxist origins of settler-colonial theories. Apart from the Marxian
elements that are to be found in the works of Wolfe and Veracini and the
historicized materialism of Shafir, this essay has traced the Marxist
"prehistory"---one might dare to say the unacknowledged origins---of
settler colonialism in the works of Rodinson and Hilal, both committed
Marxists. Scholars have challenged settler colonialism from differing
points of view, raising concerns about the validity of settler
colonialism as a concept, its overemphasis on the colonizer experience,
the economistic and materialist stress of Shafir's theories, and mainly
the lack of specificity of applying the paradigm to local historical and
social conditions. This essay takes on some of these critics---mainly
regarding the myopic look at local circumstances. It attempts to include
the history of the rise of capitalist class society within the
settler-colonial history of Palestine/Israel. The history of
Palestine/Israel has been reconstructed from a neo-Marxist and various
other sociological perspectives; however, this essay suggests a
different theoretical meeting point. It suggests [we should understand
settler colonialism from less of]{.underline} [a clear-cut vantage point
that shows the cleavages of class in both the settler and the colonized
societies and the social struggles they induce---struggles that at times
blur and defy the colonial divide that nationalist establishments wish
to reinforce and exploit.]{.underline} As the conflict between Israelis
and Palestinians originating in late-nine- teenth-century Zionism stands
at a bloody impasse, [we should seek its beginnings along the critique
that Marxism offers. It must be said that beyond the analytical tools
the Marxist tradition can afford us, its emancipatory content can give
us hope.]{.underline}

###  A2: Marxism Bad

#### Marxist examinations of primitive accumulation are the best frame to think through the motivations for occupation of Palestinian land. Anything else simply mystifies the historical and material causes of violence.

**Alfosea 13** (Francisco José Torres, Professor in the Department of
Regional Geographic Analysis and Fiscal Geography at the University of
Alicante "Application of the Accumulation by Dispossession Principle to
the Israel-Palestine Relationships" *Boletín de la Asociación de
Geógrafos Españoles*, 455-457) NIJ

According to Harvey (2004: 103) ["\[i\]f the surpluses of capital and
labour power exist within a given territory (such as a nation state) and
cannot be absorbed internally (either by geographical adjustments or
social expenditures) then they must be sent elsewhere to find a fresh
terrain for their profitable realization if they are not to be
devalued.]{.underline} This can happen in a number of ways. Markets for
commodity surpluses can be found elsewhere. But the spaces to which the
surpluses are sent must possess means of payment such as gold or
currency (e.g. dollar) reserves or tradable commodities". [In the case
under examination we have found how the process of building the State of
Israel]{.underline} (National Home for the Jewish people in the Balfour
terminology) [was precisely guided by the same parameters. The report
made in 1937 by Lord Robert Peel, head of the Palestine Royal
Commission, revealed the clear intention to occupy the Palestine
territory with Western capital and companies that would allow the
disposal of surpluses produced in the 1930s and would guarantee a
background to respond better to crisis episodes, such as the one that
occurred in 1929.]{.underline} Obviously, [this process is not exclusive
to Palestine, but]{.underline} common to other colonising phenomena in
the world too. [There are, however, two factors that make the Palestine
occupation a very significant example. On the one hand, the implication
of the Rothschild Bank, which is essential to guarantee the success of
the enterprise, especially to acquire land]{.underline} (Izquierdo,
2007) [and to shape the great economic funds]{.underline}, such as the
Keren HaYesod, [is striking. On the other hand, while in other
colonising processes]{.underline} (in Africa or Asia) [the access of
colonies to independence means the replacement of physical occupancy by
a different occupancy of a commercial nature]{.underline} (the socalled
colonial pact), [in the case of Palestine the independence from Israel
has aggravated the processes of accumulation, now in the shape of
occupancy.]{.underline} In fact, [after the Independence from the State
of Israel in May 1948, the processes of accumulation by dispossession
had to be reoriented]{.underline}; it is no longer a matter of the major
European banks locating new spaces for the expansion of industrial
capitalism at the beginning of the 20th century or acquiring devalued
land (devalued assets, according to Harvey) or disposing of production
surpluses. [Now the main goal of accumulation by dispossession,
sometimes under the guise of conflict between religions and sometimes
under the argument of security, is to control the territory by the
newly-born State under the premise that it is the only way to guarantee
its survival.]{.underline} Without specifically referring to this,
Harvey's postulates do not, however, fall far away when he points out
that "new dynamic spaces of capital accumulation ultimately generate
surpluses and have to absorb them through geographical expansions"
(Harvey, 2004: 104). Indeed, [the occupation of new territories is one
means to absorb capital surpluses, and in the case of Palestine it has
served to generate a series of valuable and economic
assets]{.underline}: 150,000 Palestinians would enter Israel every day
coming from Gaza and the West Bank before the huge Russian migratory
flow in 1993. The massive arrival of one million Ashkenazi Jews after
the fall of the Soviet bloc has limited the need for the Arab labour
force, which has always been considered suspicious --for being
fifth-columnists-- and has enabled their confinement in urban ghettos
and enclosed spaces. They are assets that are no longer necessary to
maintain the system. This is how we should understand the process
initiated in Oslo; what was offered apparently as a territory assignment
for an embryonic Palestinian State hid, however, a complex mechanism of
Bantustanization, that is, of space compartmentalization to enable the
occupation of fertile land or land with water resources (Area C of the
1995 agreements) and to separate the largest possible amount of Arabs in
ghettos (Area A). [For the system to work as best as possible, it
requires a physical enclosure]{.underline} by means of erecting a
wall/fence that measuring over 700 km long will prevent or hinder
internal movements. Also, [together with the accommodation of half a
million people in illegal settlements, it will shape a scenario of
pressure that will invalidate any attempt to achieve sovereignty by
Palestine or to gain economic viability without Israel.]{.underline}
Despite being the best-known, these are not the only tools used. In
December 2012 the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs in occupied Palestinian territories (OCHAoPt)
showed its concern about the 642 obstacles to movement1 existing in the
West Bank a euphemism that encompasses complex checkpoints to fences,
through trenches, gates closing a road, obstacles on the road network
(concrete blocks, ditches, etc). From these, only 9 checkpoints are set
on the Green Line, the other 633 obstacles are located within the
occupied territories and not on the border line between Israel and the
West Bank, which invalidates the security argument. The situation in
Hebron is especially noteworthy, as 151 of these obstacles are in its
city centre or surroundings, with a further 110 obstacles set
specifically in sector H2, occupied by Jewish settlers (OCHAoPt, 2013).
[This process fits seamlessly into Harvey's definition]{.underline}
(2004: 115) [when he remarks that "\[c\]apitalism internalizes
cannibalistic as well as predatory and fraudulent practices. But it
is]{.underline}, as Luxemburg cogently observed, ['often hard to
determine, within the tangle of violence and contests of power, the
stern laws of the economic process.' Accumulation by dispossession may
occur in a variety of ways and there is much that is both contingent and
haphazard about its modus operandi. Yet it is omnipresent in no matter
what historical period". Undoubtedly, the principle of accumulation by
dispossession is present in this case and enables a wider --not only
geopolitical but also economic-- interpretation of the
theory]{.underline} postulated by the geographer from Kent. [The height
of such dispossession is reached in Jerusalem, a landmark for the Jews
but with an Arab majority]{.underline} (mainly Muslims and, to a lesser
extent, Christians), until the Six-Day War. The demographic processes
that currently take place in this city are extraordinarily interesting
and spiralling, such as the progressive colonization by ultra-Orthodox
Jews (especially in some neighbourhoods bordering the Green Line, such
as Mea Shearim) and the proliferation of Jewish settlements in the
surrounding area (such as the gigantic E1 complex on the East). At the
same time, the Arab community, considered as resident but without
citizenship2 , experiences a high vegetative growth but is restrained by
means of a complex system of permits hindering their movements and their
interpersonal relationships. Moreover, as we have seen, it has found its
highest expression in the demolition of their homes.

#### The modern university is a ministry of misinformation in wartime -- its goal is to saturate the field of thought such that undercommon learning, forms of study that sabotage the university's propaganda machine, are unable to emerge.

Transversal Texts: Of course, the concepts you have invented, unsettled,
shifted, dislocated in The Undercommons are not meant to create a system
in any traditional sense. But there is nevertheless a certain affinity,
appositionality, proximity of concepts such as study, planning, policy,
queer debt, logisticality, general antagonism, unsettling, the shipped,
and so on. Instead of a system, would it be helpful to think rather of a
socio-geology of these concepts, and to ask where they are, especially
when they are connected? Where is the surround? Around the forts, in the
Panthers' planning, and where else? Could it be that it is everywhere,
even in surrounded rectors' offices and command bridges and prison
towers? Where (and when) is the hold? Is it the one of the slave ships
of the Black Atlantic, and/or is it everywhere something is being held
by governance and policy? Stefano Harney / Fred Moten: **[These concepts
emerge from a terrain of struggle. That terrain was unsettled long
before we fled to it.]{.underline}** **[And that struggle was planned
long before we got there, long before we got to the kitchen table, long
before we got to stand around the stove, or we were invited sit on the
steps, or to jump up in the fete.]{.underline}** [Black women thought
and fought this struggle and led us into the land we continuously
unoccupy with our hospitality.]{.underline} **[The black radical
tradition is where these concepts came from, and very specifically black
radical women then and now. And this is so because black women have been
for so long theorizing and planning what we have called the undercommons
as the place where you can no longer just be yourself and never
were.]{.underline}** **[Their planning is our queer debt, our black
debt, our trans debt, which is of course not ours.]{.underline}** The
hold is different. It is the specificity in the general deployment of
the black radical tradition, and although different accounts of
blackness may change the specificity of the hold, they cannot change the
hold's specificity. As such it cannot operate like the other concepts in
the book, but must be constantly withdrawn if the general antagonism of
our history in the present is not to be mere agonism. At the same time,
and this is a difficult kind of philosophical thing, that specificity,
which is irreducible, is also irreducible in, say, the modern world
system, because the hold of the ship is the condition of possibility of
that system. Every place held by governance and policy bears the
weight/trace of that specificity even if it can't be said to be that
specificity. Along that socio-geological line, where is the
undercommons, where is the under in undercommons, is it the mole, the
underground, the water vein, is it under and beyond like the Latin sub?
Is it implicitly antagonizing or problematizing or subverting the
concept of the common(s)? As form of knowledge it (is it they or it?)
seems to be quite different from what has been discussed as common(s),
not general, but in proximity to the general antagonism, knowledge
emerging in governance, but not in the dichotomy of victims and
subjects, not on governance's radar, but governance is always in search
of it, though it emerges before governance. As form of subjectivation,
as survival, as poetry, as affection, as connecting, not relating,
potential of resistance, not critique, abstract line, not in line, it is
everywhere. Is it everywhere? **[When we are asked about the
undercommons this way we sometimes say that we are more interested in
the undercommons of the concept than in the concept of the
undercommons]{.underline}**. **[This is to say that it is not only
important for the undercommons to remain an improper term, an
inappropriate term, an unfinished term, but it is also important for the
term to join a disallowed terminology in general, to resist the terms of
debate or the terms of service, to refuse the terms of a contract or the
terms of a settlement.]{.underline}** It's just like with credit and
debt. There are terms of credit but not terms of debt, not bad debt
anyway, not the kind we try to get into. When we study our debts, the
term never ends. **[But it may be that the undercommons is less a set of
common capacities or an imagined common space - as the term common(s)
often denotes -- and therefore less about collective living than about
collected being, or better still, being that is both collected and
stranded together, both stolen and given away, not enough but already
good and plenty; or maybe collective living in uncollected, disheveled,
dispersed being.]{.underline}** **[Maybe the question concerning "where"
belies or deflects or obscures a radical non-locality, a general
displacement, the field of the feel, a social disruption of ontology, or
at least of already existing modern ontology's commitment to a certain
classical notion of space/time.]{.underline}** 11 years after the text
on the university and the undercommons was published in Social Text,
most of it still sounds to come from today's factories of knowledge.
Still, what are your thoughts on the current state of the university,
and new recipes for its desertion? Especially as you remain inside,
working and struggling in this field... Here we could risk a bit of
philology on this piece. **[Our work started in friendship and always
already in the study of friendship. The university came to block our
ability to study, which is to say cultivate friendship
generally.]{.underline}** At first we wrote several critical texts, not
included in the book, in the mode of those who expect something from
institutions, even if that expectation is about their transformation.
But even as we were writing the 'University and the Undercommons' essay,
we came to see something clearer. And it was this: **[the modern
university is nothing other than a ministry of information during
wartime. It spews out information in support of a killing machine in a
war that Europeans and Americans have tried to globalize for five
centuries. This war is called, variously, the public, the economy, or
just 'man.' It is a war on the human, and other living things, and the
earth, primarily prosecuted in the name of the human, the improvement of
the human, the usufruct of man and nature.]{.underline}** **[Now,
firstly, a ministry of information in wartime pumps out information in
the form of lies, of misinformation. This is largely the function of the
social sciences today. But secondly, a ministry of information in
wartime also pumps out propaganda for 'its own side.' This is, of
course, the function of the humanities.]{.underline}** The sciences for
their part may be employed in either of these functions, or folded
directly and silently into the killing machine itself. **[Now what you
do with a ministry of information during wartime is that you try to
sabotage that information. And we have a word for the sabotage of
information, and that word is study. But this is to say that study,
insofar as it comes first, is what the ministry of information has
always been trying to regulate---simultaneously to accumulate and
destroy. So you try to study, where to study, to be collected and
stranded in study, in friendship, not, in the first place, to try to
sabotage information; rather we might say study sabotages information
precisely because that it is not its aim.]{.underline}** **[Study is not
a critique of information. In fact, study is aimless,
shiftless.]{.underline}** Study is a drifting hobo camp of sharecroppers
with untimely dreams of cooperative farms, dreams that never settle, as,
for instance, Christopher Taylor reads CLR James's writings on
sharecroppers. **[The university - the ministry of information -- can be
sabotaged, but it cannot be transformed. Study is not transformational.
It is deformational, subformational, formless formation.]{.underline}**
Could you tell us about the process of producing these texts? Academic
cooperation in research and writing seems to have become a must, but
your practice is a specific and very different case, not the least
because of the overlapping poetic and theoretical styles and languages,
up to the point where it is no longer possible to distinguish borders.
Is your cooperation purely affirmative or are there ways to cope with
disagreement, negation, particular antagonisms? What about the very
specific disciplinary specificities, for example, when it comes to
technical terms from economics or black aesthetics? Is there a practice
of discussing dark sentences, if there are any? How do you work together
with respect to conceptual inventions, and the sound and rhythm of the
texts, when music and poetry are not only content, but obviously also a
formal aspect? **[What if we thought of cooperation as the breakdown of
being together? What if cooperation is an emergency measure taken to
curb the emergence of the individual capable of
cooperation?]{.underline}** **[Cooperation would then be the
self-defense of friendship, its violent moment. Cooperation might then
indeed include an affirmative or dissensual communication. This violent
singling out in communication, this cooperation, may sometimes be
necessary (just) as self-defense as theorised by
revolutionaries.]{.underline}** **[But it is just as surely a deviation,
distraction, and subtraction from being together.]{.underline}** Poetry
is where dissensus and affirmation blur. In defense of undercommon
difference we wanted to make a difference engine, a generative machine,
that would also be a mechanism of and for attunement, in the tradition
of making what you say sound like something. **[We have been interested
in the transition from cooperation to black operation.]{.underline}**
Over and beyond more of the same, which is cool, what might a dark
sentence generate if a gathering forms around it[**? We were definitely
thinking about that! Hapticality, love, the interiority of sentiment.**
This seems to be a different tone than that of and about panthers,
criminality, bad debt, black debt, surround that plays with the
monstrosity of resistance, be it micro or mouselike]{.underline}. Have
you become philosophers of the feel meanwhile, and what does that mean
for a(n affirmative?) theory that dismisses critique as an operation
within the state apparatus? What about possibly being (mis)interpreted
as hippies, romanticists, or even idealists? **[Of course you can feel
all kinds of things. But also all kinds of things can feel. Hapticality
might be a way of trying to say the history of feeling has been
dominated by what we can feel, but a counter-history has been
necessarily concerned with what things feel]{.underline}**. Given how
brutal is the condition of this counter-history, as Hortense Spillers
narrates it so chillingly in her account of what she called, long before
us, empathy, it is unlikely we could ever forget what it feels like.
**[But it may also be the case that everything we do is critique, if
critique means suspicion of what is given to us in this war, and on the
other hand critique may be nothing we do if critique means system
building. Or in other words maybe there is nothing for a resistance to
become.]{.underline}** **[Take the phrase you mention, interiority of
sentiment, this is something we love, and by loving it we are making a
critique since we are told sentiment has no interiority. It is not that
the critique is not there. The thing is, we just don't care about the
critique]{.underline}**. **[Meanwhile, all the while, the Panthers were
in love.]{.underline}** In May 2015, the activist Ada Colau became mayor
of Barcelona, Barcelona en Comú won the elections, as a critical as well
as affective assemblage coming out of the molecular practice of
neighborhood assemblies, platforms against evictions and micropolitical
efforts deriving from decades of struggles against precarization,
gentrification, and the effects of the subprime crisis. What about using
your concept of prophetic organization for these practices of
reterritorialization in Spain? **[You can understand that we would
resist the idea of having our (attitudes towards) concepts applied and
tested, as if this were the only form of use for them. It would be more
interesting to learn of an experiment with or through a concept, where
the concept and experiment come into the world together, not one chasing
the other and trying to settle it. I think you would agree with us that
this would be a good use of the concept communism, for instance, or
human being, as Sylvia Wynter noted.]{.underline}** **[Of course, from
the black radical tradition, or from indigenous militancy, or Third
World feminism, indeed any number of such struggles and bodies of
theory, what we await still is some sign - not of solidarity now that
Europeans face en mass homelessness and precarity -- but a sign that
Europe might enjoy a teachable moment, an openness to ways of thinking
and feeling that are focused on (re)creating life from the ruins of
homelessness and precarity and, ultimately, Europeanness. There is no
such sign yet. In the meantime, we offer our solidarity.]{.underline}**

institution and a possibility to find other pathways of knowledge in the
social structure.]{.underline}** I am following this concept in
conversations with radical educators such as Paulo Freire, bell hooks
and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, who have been fundamental in my work on
radical pedagogy in art, self-organization and teaching. A large part of
my artistic practice has been dedicated to self-organized spaces to come
together and study, as with Malmö Free University for Women - MFK, a
feminist organization for art and knowledge exchange (2006-2011)18. MFK
was initiated by Johanna Gustavsson and me, and started very much as a
community building project, based in our feminist networks in and around
Malmö, with an attempt to get feminists from activism, art and academia
in the same room, to share knowledge and study together. Our
collaboration continued with a focus on a radical pedagogy19. **[We used
radical as in a political radicality, a radical left, in opposition to
reactionary (right). Derived from the Latin radix (root), radical means
change at the roots, and is focused on altering social structures
through revolutionary means and changing value systems in fundamental
ways. A radical pedagogy then, aims to change the value systems of
knowledge, and the structures of learning and education at its roots. It
differs from the field of critical pedagogy in that it does not only
focus on the established institutions for education.]{.underline}** **[A
radical pedagogy searches for pedagogy\'s radical possibilities, inside
and outside education. It recognizes that pedagogy happens in many
places; in the classroom, in the schoolyard, in the university, in the
home, at the workplace, in sports, in state politics, in personal
relations, in political movements, in art]{.underline}**20. **[To use
radical pedagogy as a method for research means to look at how and what
knowledge is admitted, transferred, grown, shared, produced, packaged or
force fed, and search for the possibilities that through changing the
pedagogy change existing power structures.]{.underline}**

### Aff Answers

#### Perm do both -- anarchist pedagogies stand to benefit from critical pedagogy. Anarchist educational practices can dovetail with critical pedagogical approaches to create an undercommons of institutions that inhabit them but also seek to undermine their authority.

**Rouhani 12** \[ Farhang Rouhani is a professor in the Department of
Geography at the University of Mary Washington whose pedagogy includes
anarchist education practices that revolve around challenging the
authority of the classroom space. "Practice What You Teach: Facilitating
Anarchism In and Out of the Classroom." *Antipode*, Issue 19, October
2012. //tjb\]

**[Anarchist pedagogies actively seek out possibilities for new and
different ways of learning and relating to others]{.underline}**
([Suissa
2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b28)).
**[This initial refusal to settle for existing institutional
arrangements is, in itself, an essential difference that anarchism makes
in education.]{.underline}** Armaline identifies three characteristics
for an anarchist approach to pedagogy: an approach to truth and
knowledge production that is humble in nature, the creation of spaces
for the deconstruction of oppressive systems, practices, and ideologies
in favor of horizontal ones, and an understanding of everyone as capable
of curiosity, learning, teaching, and creation ([Armaline
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b1):139).
**[Humility is essential to enable us to talk openly, honestly, and
reflectively about the limitations of the spaces and roles we occupy,
and the complexities inherent in any project of trying to create a new
world in the space of a hierarchically organized, often oppressive
institution.]{.underline}** Shannon, for example, states that "it does
no good to ignore the fact that careers are sometimes built out of
radical politics ... " and so to admit to our own self‐interest and the
nature of our work adds possibilities for reflection and
knowledge‐building in the classroom ([Shannon
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b26):185).
Second, in relation to the analysis of power relations, Suissa writes
that "**[we must question the very political framework within which we
are operating, ask what kind of society would embody, for us, the
optimal vision of 'the good life,' and ask ourselves what kind (if any)
of education system would exist in this society]{.underline}**" ([Suissa
2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b28):4).
There are ways in which the university classroom is inescapably
hierarchical, even in the most horizontally constructed student--teacher
arrangements. But to discuss authoritarianism in the classroom can lead
to both a critique of power relations in education and other social
institutions and an imagining of how to subvert and transform them.
Third, paralleling the work of scholars of critical pedagogy, Armaline
argues for an approach to learning and teaching that assumes, at the
outset, that all people can create and make knowledge and history, and
that we need to expand our understanding of what counts as worthy of
knowing and learning ([Armaline
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b1):142).
While there is a great diversity in thinking within anarchist theory,
these three characteristics of humility in approach to knowledge,
concern for creating spaces free from coercion, and a belief in human
capabilities, provide a useful opening for constructing an anarchist
pedagogy. **[Just as anarchist theory has been marginalized within
radical political‐economic theorizing in the academy, so have anarchist
perspectives on education been ignored within the domain of critical
pedagogy.]{.underline}** **[This ignorance partly stems from
misconceptions of anarchism itself as violent at worst and as
impractically naïve and utopian at best.]{.underline}** Suissa argues
that the utopianism in anarchism and a notion of practicality need not
be perceived as mutually exclusive, that anarchists embrace a practical,
contextual perspective on human virtues and responsibilities, and that
this embrace has led prominent anarchist thinkers to cultivate
systematic educational interventions in traditional ways of learning as
essential to anarchist social transformation ([Suissa
2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b28):147).
Prominent anarchist thinkers such as Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman,
Paul Goodman, and especially Francisco Ferrer, founder of the Modern
School Movement in Spain in 1901, actively supported experimental modes
of educating children in more creative, non‐authoritarian, and
empowering ways and extensively criticized the ways in which existing
modes of education as memorization and repetition reinforced dominant
power relations ([Avrich
2005](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b4);
[DeLeon
2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b8)).
**[Anarchist and critical pedagogies share many of the same concerns for
empowering people as producers of knowledge, politicizing the process of
education, and perceiving teaching and learning as central to social
transformation. Some scholars, though, point out important differences,
especially in relation to anarchist perspectives on institutions of
learning specifically and the state more generally.]{.underline}**
**[Richard Kahn]{.underline}**, for example, looks to the pedagogy of
Ivan Illich to assert a system of learning and knowing based less on a
promethean, progressive dependence on educational institutions, which he
argues as supported by Paolo Friere and others, and more on a "defense
of vernacular values and convivial tools that could meet people\'s needs
without becoming ends in themselves such as contemporary public
education systems had" ([Kahn
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b17):126;
[Illich
1973](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b16)).
He **[argues that while Frierian critical pedagogy can be highly
empowering, it depends too much on the notion of betterment through
existing educational institutions. In contrast, anarchist pedagogies
seek out and affirm a wide range of everyday spheres of learning. This
is a pedagogy that promotes creative learning, sociality, community, and
autonomous interactions with others and with the environment over
established routes of learning]{.underline}**. **[As such, it questions
the value of institutionalized education and expands our understanding
of what a good education should do for us. Related to this is a critique
of the role of the state more generally.]{.underline}** Logue and Mayo
argue that recent work on the philosophy of education has not taken up a
critique of the state as extensively as work in other disciplines
([Logue and Mayo
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b21):160).
**[Anarchist visions of a social order without coercive power structures
have important implications on pedagogy that could be productive for
imagining new systems of learning.]{.underline}** **[Despite, or perhaps
because of, these differences, DeLeon argues that a confluence of
anarchist and critical perspectives on education can be a fruitful means
for social transformation.]{.underline}** **[In particular, anarchism
adds urgency by linking critical pedagogy to practical, spontaneous, and
direct action in the present. "Learning to live cooperatively, sharing
resources, teaching ourselves strategies of resistance, forming reading
circles, teaching literacy skills, and finding ways to live sustainably
with our own natural resources are all skills and forms of knowledge
that we can acquire at schools"]{.underline}** ([DeLeon
2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b8):9).
Anarchist perspectives on education have aided me and my students in
experimenting with the possibilities of decentralizing the classroom in
ways that are anti‐heirarchical, non‐coercive, autonomous, and
cooperative; focusing on practical forms of radicalism and direct action
in discussions of theory and action; and considering critically what
kinds of work and learning are more or less vital, without a strict
definition of what counts as scholarly learning. **[At the same time,
while anarchist perspectives can lend a significant sense of creativity,
practicality, and urgency to critical pedagogy, they need much further
development.]{.underline}** Suissa argues that, **[despite the emphasis
on education, anarchist thinkers have written little about specific
aspects of pedagogy, such as the nature of teacher--pupil relationships
and approaches to moral education]{.underline}** ([Suissa
2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b28):149).
**[This is, at least in part, the result of a resistance among
anarchists to pin themselves down to a formulaic, singular approach that
could lead to its very anti‐anarchist consolidation into a discipline.
But,]{.underline}** as Stevphen Shukaitis argues, **[it is possible to
develop "an approach to education based on creating undercommons and
enclaves within multiple disciplines and spaces"]{.underline}**
([Shukaitis
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.01030.x#b27):167)
**[By undercommons, he means a collaborative terrain of resistance and
struggle within university institutions that seek to undermine those
same institutions.]{.underline}**

#### Iran is restarting uranium enrichment---Israel is seeking to first strike now.

University of Central Florida "Israel Could Strike First as Tensions
with Iran Flare"

NIJ

Iran shot down a U.S. drone on June 19, further escalating tensions
between Iran and its adversaries. [Relations with Iran have been
worsening for months]{.underline}. In early May, one year after the
United States withdrew from the nuclear deal negotiated in 2015 between
Iran, the U.S., the European Union and five other countries, [Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani said that his country may also withdraw from
the agreement, which limits its ability to develop nuclear weapons in
exchange for lifting sanctions. **In June, Rouhani announced that Iran
will restart uranium enrichment, which could put the country on track to
develop a nuclear weapon within a year.**]{.underline} Rouhani's
government insists its uranium will go to civilian nuclear power, not
weapons. As a "deterrent" to Iran, the United States is sending an
additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East. The U.S. is not the only
country considering a military response in Iran. ["Israel will not allow
Iran to obtain nuclear weapons," said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu]{.underline} on June 17. Netanyahu also said Iran must be
punished for violating the nuclear agreement. **[Israel]{.underline}**,
which has faced threats to its national security since its founding as a
Jewish homeland in the Middle East in 1948, **[is known to take
aggressive, preventive action to protect itself -- including by
launching preemptive strikes on neighboring nations it perceives as
threatening. If international relations with Iran grow more volatile,
Israel could take dramatic, unilateral action against its neighbor and
longtime adversary.]{.underline}** How the Begin Doctrine justifies
preemptive strikes I'm an international security scholar who studies
Israel's proactive use of its military to prevent nuclear buildup in the
Middle East. [Israel has a counterproliferation policy, called the Begin
Doctrine, which allows it to wage preventive strikes against enemies
with weapons of mass destruction programs. Using the Begin Doctrine as a
justification for preemptive strikes, the Israeli government has for
decades quietly decimated nuclear and chemical facilities across the
Middle East.]{.underline} When President Saddam Hussein's potential
nuclear military ambitions raised concerns in 1981, the Israeli
government destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor in a surprise attack
called Operation Opera. "On no account shall we permit an enemy to
develop weapons of mass destruction against the people of Israel," a
government release stated at the time. "We shall defend the citizens of
Israel in good time and with all the means at our disposal." In 2007,
Israel responded to Syria's failure to report its uranium processing by
striking a nuclear reactor in the Deir ez-Zor region. The United States,
which was reportedly informed ahead of the attack, made no effort to
stop Israel. [Israel has also been accused of sponsoring the
assassinations of at least four Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010.
The incidents have never been fully investigated, and Israel has neither
confirmed nor denied responsibility for the targeted killings. Israel
has also deterred nuclear proliferation in the Mideast using less
lethal, more high tech strategies. In 2008 and 2009, Israel used
computer malware called Stuxnet to disrupt Iran's nuclear
infrastructure. The program infected the software that controlled
centrifuge speed at the Natanz nuclear plant, alternately speeding up
and slowing down the machines that produce enriched uranium to cripple
production of the material.]{.underline} The Obama administration
secretly supported the cyberattacks. Though the United States, United
Nations and other world powers officially condemned some of these
unprovoked Israeli military aggression, other preemptive Israeli attacks
have been met with silence from the international community. [The
international community may even appreciate Israel's role as a nuclear
nonproliferation watchdog in the Middle East, my research suggests.
Israel has never been punished for attacking its neighbors' weapons
programs.]{.underline} Decades after Israel's 1981 attack on Iraq's
nuclear plant, President Bill Clinton called it "a really good thing."
"It kept Saddam Hussein from developing nuclear power," he said at the
2005 Davos World Economic Forum. "But it's not clear to me they have
that option in Iran," he added. Israel vs. Iran That was 14 years ago.
In 2005, Iran was just beginning its nuclear buildup. [**Today, Israel's
government seems strong in its belief that it has the option to strike
Iran.** Iran's Islamic fundamentalist government is openly hostile to
Israel. Citing fears that Iran would use nuclear weapons against Israel,
Netanyahu has warned, "Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would be
infinitely more costly than any scenario you can imagine to stop it." He
told Iran and other adversaries not to "test" Israel.
**If**]{.underline} the nuclear deal ruptures further and **[Iran does
restarting uranium enrichment, Israel might launch targeted airstrikes
against it.]{.underline}** Risks of an Israeli strike History suggests
other countries are unlikely to actively deter Israeli military
aggression in the guise of nuclear nonproliferation. The Trump
administration has expressed anti-Iranian sentiment and is a staunch
backer of Netanyahu's government. And while European powers will
recognize preemptive Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities as a
violation of international law and of the sovereignty of Israel's
neighbors, they also see Iran's nuclear program as a grave global
security concern. A nuclear Iran could escalate ongoing Middle East
conflicts into nuclear exchanges, and, as some commentators say, spur
other regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to develop nuclear
weapons themselves. Of course, potential Israeli attacks on Iran present
their own serious risks. Because most of Iran's reactors are in full
operations, air strikes may mean cutting off the power supply to Iranian
citizens and could release large amounts of radioactive contaminants
into the air. **[Iran, a militarily well-equipped country, would surely
retaliate against any Israeli attacks. That, too, would trigger a
conflict that would spiral throughout the Middle East.]{.underline}** Of
course, Israel faced similar dangers when it went after the weapons
programs of Syria, Iraq and other neighbors. If history is any guide,
Israel may strike Iran while the world quietly watches.

#### US security and military aid commitments currently restrain Israel from striking Iran's nuclear program -- cutting them would result in strikes.

**Freilich 17** (Charles D., Former Israeli Deputy National Security
Advisor and a Senior Fellow at Harvard University\'s Belfer Center "Can
Israel Survive Without America?" *Survival* 59, no. 4, p. 139-140) NIJ

For the most part, as a small actor facing numerous and often severe
threats, but with limited influence of its own, reliance on the US has
become the panacea for virtually all of Israel's national-security
challenges. Israel can and does appeal to other countries, but this is
usually of marginal utility, and [what the US cannot achieve, Israel
almost certainly cannot]{.underline}, so there has often been limited
interest in even trying. [Whether]{.underline} on the peace process, in
which there has been competition with the Arab side for American favour,
[the Iranian nuclear programme]{.underline}, other issues of regional
WMD proliferation, terrorism, efforts to delegitimise and impose
sanctions on Israel, [and just about everything else, turning to
Washington has been Israel's primary recourse. In effect, the US and
Israel long ago reached an unwritten understanding. The US provides
Israel with massive military assistance, a de facto security
guarantee]{.underline}, broad but not total diplomatic support and
(previously) economic assistance. [In exchange, Israel is expected to
consult with Washington on issues of importance prior to taking action,
demonstrate military restraint and diplomatic moderation, even make some
concessions, and accord the American position overriding
importance.]{.underline} Israel certainly does act independently at
times, probably more often than one might expect in a totally asymmetric
relationship such as this. With a few exceptions, however, US policy has
been the primary determining factor in virtually all major
national-security decisions Israel has made ever since the special
relationship emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, and in many cases long
before then. On matters pertaining to major military operations, Israel
virtually always accords primacy to the US position, and it does so on
most diplomatic issues as well. In 1967, at a time when US--Israeli
relations were still quite limited, the Israelis only went to war after
president Lyndon Johnson informed them that he would not be able to
fulfil the earlier US commitment to open the Straits of Tiran, which
Egypt had closed to Israeli shipping, and arguably provided an 'amber
light' for Israeli action. **[In 1973 the primary reason Israel
refrained from conducting a pre-emptive strike,]{.underline}** even once
it had become clear that an Egyptian and Syrian attack was imminent,
**[was the fear of the American response.]{.underline}** Israel only
launched the 1982 Lebanon war after at least partially convincing the US
of the need for a largescale military operation, a process which took
the better part of a year. **[In 1991, Israel refrained from responding
to Iraqi missile attacks largely due to American
pressure.]{.underline}** The American demand that Israel refrain from
attacking Lebanon's civil infrastructure during the 2006 war left the
IDF without a viable military strategy, and was one of the primary
reasons for the difficulties Israel encountered. Concern over a
potential lack of support by the incoming Obama administration led
Israel to terminate the 2008 operation in Gaza earlier than intended.
**[Israel's decision to refrain from a strike on the Iranian nuclear
programme, even though it considered it an existential threat, is a
particularly important example of the primacy it accords the US
position, and especially of the need for American support for major
military action. American opposition was not the only factor in Israel's
calculus, but it was certainly a decisive one.]{.underline}** Some also
question whether there was any viable military option available and thus
believe that the nuclear deal, negotiated by the US, was actually the
least bad outcome for Israel -- again demonstrating its dependence on
the US, even in the face of existential danger.8 Israel's reported
strike against a covert Syrian nuclear reactor in 2008 was conducted
only after intensive consultations and with considerable US support.9

#### Israeli lashout will be nuclear -- a unilateral preventive strike remains on the table, even after the Iran deal.

**[Israeli government skepticism toward what was called as the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is of consequence. While the
possibility of an Israeli unilateral preventive strike option is off the
table, for now, the assumption that it was discarded entirely is
premature.]{.underline}** **[On the contrary, the strike option was
shelved, still in mint condition, but ready to be used on short
order.]{.underline}** As long as Iran remains committed to its
revolutionary agenda and the current Israeli leadership (or its
ideological kin) are in power, the strike option would resemble
Chekhov's gun, flashed in the first act of a play and destined to
eventually be put to use. **[If and when Israel assesses that the
Iranian clerical regime moves toward a nuclear fait accompli, the
pressure to resort to unilateral preventive strike may prove
overwhelming.]{.underline}** **[Resorting to a unilateral strike has
been and seems to remain the orientation of the Israeli
leadership.]{.underline}** In March 2014, then--defense minister Moshe
Ya'alon remarked, "if we wished that the work of the righteous would be
done by others, it is not going to be happening soon, and therefore it
is needed to conduct oneself in this area according to \[the saying\]
'if I am not for myself, who is for
me?'"[8](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f8)
**[If anything, the Israeli position remains firm after the July 2015
agreement with Iran. As soon as the deal was made public, Ya'alon
ominously commented that the "bottom line is, a bad deal is coming, and
after it, we will have to be prepared to defend ourselves on our
own.]{.underline}**"[9](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f9)

Enriched Uranium Limit Will Be Breached On 27 June"

**[Iran has announced it will breach on 27 June the limit on its
stockpile of enriched uranium that was set under a 2015 nuclear deal
with world powers. Its atomic energy agency said it had quadrupled
production of the material, which is used to make reactor fuel and
potentially nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** But it added there was
\"still time\" for European countries to act by protecting Iran from
reinstated US sanctions. The US, which pulled out of the deal, accused
Iran of \"nuclear extortion\". \"This is a pattern of 40 years of
behaviour, it\'s consistent with how the Iranian regime behaves,\" US
state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. \"We would say to the
international community that we should not yield to nuclear extortion by
the Iranian regime.\" [The UK, France and Germany have warned Iran not
to violate the 2015 deal. They have previously said they will have no
choice but to reimpose their own sanctions, which were lifted in return
for limits on the Iranian nuclear programme.]{.underline} In a separate
development, Iran said it had broken up a cyber spying network run by
the CIA. It said several US spies had been arrested in different
countries. The US did not immediately comment on the allegation. The
latest developments come at a time of high tension in the Middle East,
with the US accusing Iran of being behind suspected attacks that left
two oil tankers ablaze in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday. Iran has denied
any involvement.

[The difference between this summer and the summer seasons of the
beginning of the decade is that this time things do not really depend on
Israel. The United States]{.underline}, by means of its withdrawal from
the agreement, the presentation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's
12-point plan against Iran, and the imposition of sanctions on companies
from third countries that trade with it [has created a new regional
reality.]{.underline} **[It's doubtful that Trump himself wants a war
with Iran. At the beginning of this week he described the attacks on the
tankers as "very minor,"]{.underline}** then on Thursday he delivered,
as is his wont, a series of contradictory, confusing responses to the
drone incident. However, the dynamic of escalation does not necessarily
depend on what the sides want. And there are elements in the
administration, first and foremost National Security Adviser John
Bolton, who have in the past advocated regime change by force.

relationship', the price of a truly remarkable partnership has been a
significant loss of Israeli independence. **[Indeed, Israel's dependence
on the US has become so deep that it is questionable whether the country
could even survive today without it.]{.underline}** For Americans and
Israelis alike, these are controversial assertions. Many Americans are
critical of what they perceive to be ongoing Israeli disregard for US
policy preferences, and even acts of defiance, despite an entirely
asymmetric relationship and vast American aid. This is particularly true
at a time when Israel is led by a hardline government. Israelis, for
their part, do not wish to be this dependent on a foreign power, even
one as friendly and well meaning towards Israel as the US, and they view
Israel's ongoing freedom of decision and manoeuvre as vital to its
national security. How dependent? [Total American assistance to Israel,
from its establishment in 1949 up to 2016, amounts to approximately
\$125 billion, a whopping sum, making Israel the largest beneficiary of
American aid in the post-Second World War era.1 By the end of the
ten-year military-aid package recently agreed for 2019--28, the total
figure will be nearly \$170bn. US aid in recent years has accounted for
some 3% of Israel's total national budget, and 1% of its
GDP.]{.underline}2 [As such, its termination would require significant
belt-tightening and painful cuts to Israel's already overstretched
budget for domestic needs, such as health and education, which would
inflame social tensions.]{.underline} It would not, however, pose an
insurmountable challenge to Israel's national economy. [The true impact
would be on Israel's defence budget.]{.underline} In recent years, [US
aid has constituted approximately 20% of Israel's total defence
budget]{.underline} (which includes pensions, and care and compensation
for wounded veterans and widows), [or 40% of the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) budget,]{.underline}3 [and almost the entire procurement budget.
Termination would thus have a devastating impact on Israel's defence
posture]{.underline}, unless a major reordering of national priorities
took place, with profound economic and societal ramifications. [Unlike
Israel's adversaries, who can procure weapons from numerous sources with
few political constraints, Israel's reliance on the US is critical. None
of the other major arms producers today -- Britain, France, Russia,
China -- would, or could, replace the US. Certainly, none would be
willing to provide the funding, and, in any event, there is no
qualitative substitute for American arms. Indeed, the US is committed by
statute to preserving Israel's qualitative military edge (QME: that is,
'the ability to counter and defeat any credible conventional military
threat from any individual state, or possible coalition of states, or
from non-state actors, while sustaining minimal damage and casualties
... including weapons ... superior in capability to those of such other
individual or possible coalitions of states and non-state
actors').]{.underline}4 [Israel apparently enjoys a de facto US security
guarantee, an important addition to its own deterrent capabilities at
all times, but one which may prove critical in the future]{.underline},
for example, [if the]{.underline} nightmarish -- but
[possible]{.underline} -- [scenario of a Middle East with multiple
nuclear actors emerges.]{.underline} **[No other country would or could
address Iran's nuclear programme, a potentially existential threat for
Israel]{.underline}**, as the US did, even if there were eventual
differences over the means of doing so. No other country would have
helped Israel build a rocket and missile shield, the only one of its
kind in the world, or have engaged (reportedly) in joint offensive cyber
operations. The US further provides Israel with a link to its global
satellite missile launch surveillance system, which gives it an
invaluable extra few minutes of warning time, enabling civilians to take
shelter, and the IDF to prepare and take countermeasures. The military
relationship also includes extensive bilateral exercises, allowing the
IDF to learn some of the most advanced tactics in the world. Some of the
exercises have been multilateral, thereby contributing to the
strengthening of Israel's foreign relations, in some cases with
strategic importance. The US has prepositioned a large store of weapons
and munitions in Israel, to which Israel has partial access,5 and the
two countries engage in a wide variety of counter-terrorism,
homeland-security and counter-proliferation measures. Unequivocal
American support for Israel during the 2006 war in Lebanon made it the
first military confrontation in the history of the Arab--Israeli
conflict in which Israel did not face constraints of 'diplomatic time'.
The US and Israel conduct unusually close and intensive strategic
dialogue and planning. On the Iranian nuclear programme in particular,
the two countries engaged in a broad, largely unprecedented strategic
conversation for some 20 years. Other issues have included, inter alia,
the Iraqi, Syrian and Libyan programmes for weapons of mass destruction,
the situation in Syria, Hizbullah and Hamas, the Palestinian issue and
much more. Intelligence cooperation -- an area in which the US also
benefits greatly from the relationship, but which is critical for Israel
-- is broad. [On the diplomatic level, too, the US is truly the
indispensable nation for Israel, with no alternative for the foreseeable
future. The US has used its diplomatic clout in a variety of
international forums to protect Israel from an endless array of
injurious resolutions regarding the peace process, various Israeli
military and diplomatic initiatives and, of particular note, its
purported nuclear capabilities.]{.underline}6 [No other permanent member
of the Security Council would repeatedly use its veto, as the United
States has done, to shield Israel from such resolutions, including
possible sanctions, even over policies with which it has sometimes
disagreed.]{.underline} Between 1954 and 2011, the US vetoed a total of
some 40 one-sided or clearly anti-Israeli resolutions.7

So much for the regions of modest concern. [The Middle
East]{.underline}/North Africa region, by contrast, [is a part of the
world where American retrenchment or narrowing U.S. military
capabilities could have extensive adverse effects. While the region has
a number of nations with significant military capability, it does not
have a functioning method for preserving order without outside
involvement.]{.underline} **[As U.S. power recedes, it could turn out
that American involvement was in fact a deterrent against Iran taking a
more adventurous regional posture]{.underline}**, for instance. **[With
the United States gone, Tehran could become more
aggressive]{.underline}**, propelling the Middle East toward division
into hostile Shiite and Sunni blocs and encouraging the spread of
nuclear weapons. With fewer ties between regional armed forces and the
United States, there also could be a new round of military coups.
[States of the region could increase pressure on Israel, possibly
leading to pre-emptive military strikes by the Israelis, with a risk of
another major war.]{.underline} One of the al-Qaida affiliates might
seize control of a state or exercise outright control of at least part
of a collapsed state. Or China might see American withdrawal as an
opportunity to play a greater role in the region, particularly in the
Persian Gulf.

###  Perception

#### Israel is on the brink now because Trump didn't strike -- cutting funds would signal they have to be aggressive.

**Caspit 6/21** (Ben, Columnist for Al-Monitor\'s Israel Pulse "Trump
May Chicken Out on Iran, frets Israel"

NIJ

[Israel has also shifted position substantively as regards the conduct
of US President Donald Trump.]{.underline} On June 20, for the first
time in ages, [unnamed Israeli analysts directed veiled criticism at
Trump's "weakness" on Iran, accusing him of being insufficiently
"offensive" and slamming his confused reaction to the downing of the
costly US drone over the Gulf. The report that Trump had ordered a
military strike on Iranian targets only to rescind his order as the
fighter jets were en route only sharpened the criticism]{.underline} by
"diplomatic sources" described as close to Netanyahu. It\'s a scenario
we predicted several months ago: Trump would get cold feet once the
moment of truth was at hand, lose interest or choke and avoid action.
["The fact that the US did not respond to the drone downing and the
attack on the tankers in the Gulf conveys weakness and boosts the
self-confidence of the Revolutionary Guard," an Israeli diplomatic
source told Al-Monitor]{.underline} on condition of anonymity. "The
president does not realize that in order for pressure on Iran to
succeed, the Iranians must believe that he is capable of attacking. If
they understand he is playing a game of chicken with them, they will
manipulate him just as they did President \[Barack\] Obama." However,
not everyone in Israel is of the same mind. Defense officials are being
cautious and saying little on the Iranian issue at this point. They were
not wild about the short June 20 video of Netanyahu against the backdrop
of Israeli and American flags declaring support for the United States
after the downing of the drone and calling on the rest of the world to
follow suit. Many in Israel's top security echelons still remember that
Israel was perceived as having goaded the United States into the
disastrous 2003 invasion of Iraq, which in hindsight caused immense
strategic damage to Israel's interests, too. "We must not embroil
ourselves in this story. We have to walk away from the display window
and lie low," a former IDF officer told Al-Monitor on condition of
anonymity. "It is not wise to be perceived as trying to set the region
on fire and sic Trump on \[Iranian Supreme Leader Ali\] Khamenei. In the
medium and long run, it could cause us grave damage." [Meanwhile, the
IDF is intensifying its preparations for a possible confrontation with
Iran]{.underline} or one of its proxies such as Hezbollah or other
Shiite militias, the Syrian regime, Islamic Jihad along the northern
front and elsewhere. It conducted an extensive military drill this week
focused in the north and including many regular and reserve troops.
Various arms of the IDF's commando division also took part in the
exercise, as did air and ground forces. [The United States has
reportedly approved the sale of sophisticated mid-air KC-46 refueling
tankers to Israel for the first time, which will significantly extend
Israel's strategic capabilities and make it easier to attack Iran if the
need arises.]{.underline} The signals are designed to disabuse Gen.s
Hossein Salami and Qasem Soleimani, the commanders of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force, respectively, of the idea
they can strike Israel to cause the United States pain. [Netanyahu
visited the drilling troops this week and warned, "I say to our enemies:
The IDF has an immense destructive power. Do not test us."]{.underline}
Iran has a well developed tool kit on several fronts with Israel. Its
numerous and varied options for provocation were discussed and analyzed
in great detail at various Israeli defense forums this week. "The
Iranian goal is to prove to the Trump administration that Iran has
extensive potential to harm US interests and allies in the region ---
that it is able to take a significant toll on President Trump for his
continued tightening of sanctions and chokehold around Tehran, and that
it has no intention of being scared off or letting go," a senior Israeli
defense source told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity. "The Iranians
are experts at brinkmanship and their maneuvering capabilities on the
edge of volcanoes are impressive. The most troubling thing as far as
Israel is concerned is that right now they have nothing to lose." In
light of these developments, **[there is growing concern in Jerusalem
that]{.underline}** at the decisive moment, **[Trump will step
back.]{.underline}** "Trump can disengage and we will be forced to stay
here with all the burning fronts vis-à-vis Iran," a former top IDF
official told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity. "The problem is we
have no way of foreseeing what will happen and what the president will
do. Unlike the Iranians, Trump is a lot less predictable and where he is
involved, any scenario is possible. We will have to prepare for them
all."

#### Perception of decreases in support are sufficient to trigger preemptive strikes.

**Evron 12** (Yair, has taught international relations at the Department
of Political Science, Tel Aviv University and was its chairman
1987-1990, "EXTENDED DETERRENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST",
http://www-tandfonline-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/10736700.2012.734186)

In light of the conditions hindering the development of a stable
hypothetical Israeli-Iranian nuclear deterrence relationship, we can
infer some tentative conclusions. On a first level of analysis, Israel
and Iran would probably be mutually deterred from launching a first
strike because of the certainty of a devastating counterattack. Because
Israel already has a credible second strike capability, Iran would
likely be deterred from launching a first strike. Since the destruction
of Iran is not an Israeli objective, Israel would have no motivation for
a first strike. Thus, [mutual deterrence could prevail. However,
problems might arise under several other conditions, such as: an
escalating crisis between Israel and an ally of Iran]{.underline} (e.g.,
Syria, Hezbollah), [which would heighten fears of a rival's first
strike, or a situation wherein domestic instability breeds uncertainties
about the control over nuclear assets, leading to fears of potential
unauthorized use]{.underline}. Given these possible scenarios,
**[significant and continuous efforts must be made to stabilize an
Israeli-Iranian nuclear dyad]{.underline}**. Such efforts should
include, among other things, arms control agreements and
confidence-building measures. [US extended deterrence to Israel should
not be considered a substitute for Israel's own capability and
deterrence posture, but rather as an element to **further stabilize the
Israeli-Iranian nuclear relationship**]{.underline}. [US reassurances to
Israel]{.underline} that it would help deter an aggressive Iran would
also indirectly [reassure]{.underline} Iran [that]{.underline}, in a
crisis, **[Israel would not need to preemptively strike]{.underline}**.

##  Impacts

###  Impact -- Middle East War

#### Israel strikes spark great Middle East war

**Hour & Eisenstadt 18** (Major Nadav Ben, Israel Defense Forces and a
Visiting Military Fellow with The Washington Institute; Michael, The
Washington Institute's Kahn Fellow and Director of Its Military and
Security Studies Program "The Great Middle Eastern War of 2019"

NIJ

[Growing tensions on Israel's northern border have raised concerns
about]{.underline} yet another Israel-Hezbollah confrontation or [a war
between Israel and Iran]{.underline} in Syria. [Such a war may not be
limited]{.underline} to the original participants, but could involve an
array of Shi'a militias and even the Assad regime, [and could span the
region]{.underline}---thereby affecting vital U.S. interests. [Two
factors are driving these tensions: efforts by Hezbollah and
Syria]{.underline}---with Iran's help---to produce highly accurate
missiles in Lebanon and Syria that could cripple Israel's critical
infrastructure and make life there intolerable; [and Iran's efforts to
transform Syria into a springboard for military operations against
Israel]{.underline} and a platform for projecting power in the Levant.
Iran, however, while pursuing an anti-status quo agenda that has often
brought it into conflict with Israel and the United States, has shown
that it seeks to avoid conventional wars and consequent heavy losses to
its own forces. Instead, it relies on proxy operations, terrorism, and
non-lethal shaping activities. Yet it has occasionally been willing to
venture high-risk activities that entail a potential for escalation.
(Example: Iranian forces in Syria launched an explosives-laden UAV into
Israeli airspace in February; it was shot down, but the incident sparked
a round of clashes.) [Israel]{.underline} also seems intent on avoiding
war, though its actions [show that it is willing to accept the risk of
escalation to counter these emerging threats. Indeed, since 2013 it has
carried out more than 130 strikes in Syria on arms shipments destined
for Hezbollah, and since late 2017 it has expanded this "campaign
between the wars" to target Iranian military facilities in
Syria]{.underline}---without, thus far, sparking a wider confrontation.
Complacency is, however, unwarranted. The two major Arab-Israeli
confrontations of the recent past (Lebanon 2006, Gaza 2014) resulted
from unintended escalation. The emerging dynamic between Israel, Iran,
and the "axis of resistance" is a formula for a third major "accident,"
and so deserves careful analysis. MULTIPLE ACTORS, FRONTS, AND DOMAINS
[The potential for yet another war---one of unprecedented scope and
complexity---is an outcome of the Syrian civil war, which has enabled
Iran to build a military infrastructure in Syria and to deploy its Shi'a
"foreign legion" to Israel's borders. War is now possible on multiple
fronts and in far-flung theaters, fought on land, in the air, at sea,
and in information and cyber domains by fighters from Hezbollah, Iran,
Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and even Yemen. The widened scope of
a possible war will create new military options for Iran and Hezbollah,
and stretch Israeli capabilities to their limits.]{.underline} Hezbollah
Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said as much, though perhaps with
some exaggeration, when he warned in June 2017 that "**[if an Israeli
war is launched]{.underline}** against Syria or Lebanon it is not known
that the fighting will remain Lebanese-Israeli, or Syrian-Israeli," and
"**[this could open the way for thousands, even hundreds of thousands of
fighters from all over the Arab and Islamic world to
participate.]{.underline}**" Likewise, IRGC Commander Mohammad Ali
Jafari stated in November 2017 that, "The fate of the resistance front
is interwoven and they all stand united, and if Israel attacks a part of
it, the other component of the front will help it." **[Such a war is
most likely to occur as a result of]{.underline}** unintended
escalation, after another Iranian action against Israel from Syria, or
after an Israeli strike in Lebanon or Syria (for example, against
missile production facilities). It could start as a result of a U.S.
and/or **[Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program.]{.underline}** It
might even come about as a result of a conflict that starts in the Gulf
but that reaches Israel's borders---perhaps as a result of Iranian
diversionary moves (much as Saddam Hussein tried in 1991 to derail the
U.S. military campaign to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait by launching
missiles at Israel). A new northern war could resemble one of several
scenarios: Lebanon War Plus. A war between Israel and Hezbollah in
Lebanon, in which Iranians, thousands of foreign Shi'a fighters, and
even Hamas (which has established a limited military presence in
southern Lebanon) also participate. The Syrian front remains relatively
quiet, with Israel acting there on a limited basis to interdict the
movement of fighters and capabilities into Lebanon. War in Syria. A war
between Israeli and Iranian forces, Shi'a militias (including Hezbollah
fighters), and perhaps even elements of the Syrian military, fought on
Syrian territory. The Lebanese front remains relatively quiet. Should
Syrian ground forces get drawn into combat, however, Russia might
intervene to protect its client. A Two-Front War. A war in Lebanon and
Syria between Israeli and Iranian troops, Hezbollah, Shi'a militias, and
perhaps even elements of the Syrian military, in which both sides treat
Lebanon and Syria as a single, unified theater of operations. All three
of these scenarios entail a potential for escalation or spillover into
secondary fronts or theaters, and the involvement of additional actors:
Additional Fronts/Theaters. A war in Lebanon and/or Syria might prompt:
attacks on Israel from Gaza, unrest in the West Bank, or terrorist
attacks in Israel; Houthi attacks on Israeli interests (such as Israeli
maritime traffic in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait), or Israeli strikes on
Houthi targets in Yemen; missile attacks on Israel by Shi'a militias in
Iraq, and Israeli counterstrikes. Some of these militias have already
warned that the latter could trigger attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq.
Israel vs. Iran. During fighting in Syria or Lebanon, Israel attacks
Iran to strike a blow against the central pillar of the enemy coalition,
and to thereby influence the course of the war. Alternatively, Iran
augments attacks on Israel from Syria or Lebanon with attacks from its
own territory, perhaps after suffering heavy losses in Syria. These
could take the form of air or missile strikes and/or destructive
cyberattacks on military targets and critical infrastructure. A Regional
War? A low-probability/high-impact scenario in which [a
conflict]{.underline} in the Levant [morphs into a regional
war]{.underline} involving Saudi Arabia and perhaps the United Arab
Emirates as well. [Israel responds to attacks]{.underline} on its
critical infrastructure [with air strikes]{.underline} or cyberattacks
on Iran's oil industry or even its nuclear facilities---with the
encouragement and perhaps logistical assistance of Gulf Arab states.
[Iran retaliates against Israel, but also conducts missile strikes,
sabotage, or cyberattacks on Arab oil facilities across the Gulf,
leading to escalation there, and perhaps even military intervention by
the United States.]{.underline}

For years, the great nations of Europe spent huge sums of money to build
their military might. They assembled themselves into blocs, all the
better to play a dangerous game of power politics. Slowly, surely, they
were stumbling toward war. In June 1914, an assassin shot the heir to
the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the powder keg was lit.
The results were disastrous. [The Middle East today looks frighteningly
similar to the Europe of the early 20th Century.]{.underline} For years,
the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have
competed---Iran, as the champion of the Shia Islamic world, the House of
Saud as the de facto leader of the Sunni world. [Iran has a massive
military, as well as major capabilities in unconventional warfare and
espionage. It influences or outright controls Hezbollah in Lebanon,
Assad in Syria, and the powerful Shia militias in Iraq. Now, Tehran is
encouraging---and most likely aiding---the Al Houthis rebelling in
Yemen. The Saudis, powerful in their own right, have allied with Al Sisi
in Egypt, King Abdullah in Jordan, and most of the other Gulf Arab
States. They are also allied with the Pakistanis, who have one of the
largest militaries in the world, and nuclear weapons to boot.
Additionally, there is a growing possibility that the Turks may throw in
with the Sunni side. **It's a huge amount of fire power, rivalry and
armed conflict concentrated in a comparatively small region. And this
tinderbox could blow up into a major conflagration, with destructive
consequences unparalleled since World War Two.**]{.underline} But, some
might say, these opposing blocs have been in place for decades, [why the
worry now? Quite simply, because America is no longer playing the role
it has played in the region for a long, long time. For decades, the U.S.
served as security guarantor and diplomatic trouble-shooter for our
friends in the region. The Saudis, Jordanians, Egyptians, and other
friendlies didn't have to worry that Iran would gain regional hegemony.
They knew a strong, assertive America would keep Iran's ambitions in
check.]{.underline} Meanwhile, Iran and its proxies knew they could go
only so far before being slowed and stopped by the judicious use of
America power. [The credible threat of American hard power was enough to
keep our friends calm and our enemies quiet. That has changed. Our
enemies have seen the U.S. "lead from behind" in Libya, then turn its
back on our consulate in Benghazi. They've seen us draw a "red line" in
Syria, then walk away when Assad called our bluff. They've seen Russia
annex Crimea and bolster the separatists in eastern Ukraine while
America refuses to provide military aid to Kiev. They've seen us flinch
at the thought of putting American boots on the ground in the fight
against ISIS. Put it all together, and it's a picture of an America that
is timid, or confused, or flaccid---a nation that still talks a good
hard-power game, but lacks the will to follow through. Moreover, they
see an Administration so hungry for a "legacy" deal with Iran, that the
Iranians considerable negotiating skills are not even being
taxed.]{.underline} In the G5+1 talks in Lausanne Secretary of State
John Kerry has made concession after concession with no quid pro quo
from Iran---to the point that France is now emerging as the hardliner on
our side of the negotiating table. Our enemies aren't the only ones who
notice these developments. Our friends do, too. [What must the Saudis
and the others think when they see the administration cast aside
regional ally No. 1---Israel? Can their "push out the door" be far off
if they get in the way of the Administration's single-minded drive to
appease the Iranian regime?]{.underline} Those friends now have reason
to fear that the nuclear negotiations with Iran will accelerate the U.S.
withdrawal from the region or---even worse---produce an Iranian-American
rapprochement at their expense. It is this fear that has led our friends
to band together to defend themselves against what they know to be a
growing threat: Iran. While the Obama administration may be willing to
turn a blind eye to this threat in its pursuit of a nuclear deal, Iran's
neighbors do not have that luxury. Since the U.S. has cut back on
dispensing its usual antibiotics, our jittery friends in the Middle East
now feel that they must counter---strongly and immediately---the local
infections promoted and exploited by Iran. And they are sometimes doing
so without consulting the U.S. **[The result is a Middle East more
explosive and unpredictable than ever. The conditions are now ripe for a
major Middle Eastern war---one that could spill across the globe,
wherever Sunni and Shia Muslims interact. All that remains missing is a
spark.]{.underline}** Impossible you say? That June day in Sarajevo, no
experts predicted the horrifying consequences of Garo Princip's actions.
Today, the Saudis are massing 150,000 troops on the border with Yemen.
The Pakistanis and the Egyptians have promised ground troops. These
Sunnis Governments view their alliance as one of self-defense. But it's
a huge threat to Iran's desires for hegemony, and Tehran may even view
it as a threat to the survival of the mullahs' regime. No one wants war,
big or little. [But among the power blocs of the Middle East,
Washington's misbegotten policies have fueled uncertainty on one side
and perceived opportunity on the other.]{.underline} In the aftermath of
the Second World War, Americans have always dreaded a clash of the
superpowers. But the lesson of the First World War is that when large
regional powers---especially those driven by sectarian and apocalyptic
forces---are poised to fight, any miscalculation can be equally
cataclysmic. [That situation exists today in the Middle East. And the
Administration, far from easing the tensions, is actively destabilizing
the region]{.underline} through its dealings with Iran.

###  Yes Strikes -- No Israel Strike

#### Strike on Iran still on the table -- Israel is considering it

Israeli Strike on Iran, Says Option Still on the Table"

[A former Israeli army chief of staff dismissed the notion that he and
other security chiefs prevented]{.underline} Prime Minister Benjamin
[Netanyahu from attacking Iran's nuclear facilities a decade ago, and
said the option of carrying out such a strike remains on the
table.]{.underline} In his first major interview since entering politics
last month, Gabi Ashkenazi said that if Netanyahu and the government had
ordered the Israel Defense Forces to strike Iran when he was IDF chief
(from 2007-2011), "we would have saluted the flag" and set about the
mission. As chief of staff, Ashkenazi said his job had been to ensure
that the political echelon had a "realistic option" should it choose to
attack, and to give his professional advice on the merits of such an
attack. But [the final decision]{.underline}, he told Channel 12 news in
a lengthy interview broadcast Saturday night, [was obviously one for the
elected officials, not the generals.]{.underline} Declining to elaborate
on behind-closed-discussions a decade ago, when it has been reported
that Netanyahu and his then-defense minister Ehud Barak wanted to strike
Iran, but Ashkenazi, then Mossad chief Meir Dagan and other security
chiefs prevented this, Ashkenazi said he would not comment further, in
part because the issue was still relevant. "Since [Iran, and a nuclear
Iran, and the possibility of a military strike against a nuclear Iran,
remain relevant]{.underline}" and "is not behind us," [said
Ashkenazi]{.underline}, what was discussed in classified meetings would
have to remain secret. [Israel believes Iran continues to seek to attain
nuclear weapons, despite having been required to dismantle some parts
and freeze others of its rogue nuclear program, and to submit to
intrusive inspections]{.underline}, under its 2015 deal with the P5+1
powers. Opposed by Netanyahu, the deal has also been castigated by US
President Donald Trump, who withdrew the US from it last year.

Main contours of Israeli nuclear policy and doctrine Nuclear policy
**[Right from the outset, Israel has maintained a nuclear policy of
'strategic ambiguity', known as 'Amimut' in Hebrew, which emanated from
the slogan of 'never again' adopted by the Jewish Defence League. The
never again motto means, "never again will Jews be victimized; never
again will Jews be scapegoats; never again will \[Jews\] stand idly by
while Jewish blood is spilled; never again will \[Jews\] be
silent."]{.underline}**64 **[Therefore, nuclear weapons remain the
Israeli insurance against regional and extra-regional
threats.]{.underline}** Self-reliance The core of Israeli defence policy
is based on self-help and self- reliance. [Although Israel enjoys very
strong military ties with European and other states like China, India,
and the US, it neither solely relies on their support nor has concluded
any formal defence treaties with any of them.]{.underline} Israel
believes that such an arrangement could limit its defensive and
offensive options.65 Deliberate nuclear ambiguity **[Israel neither
confirms nor denies the existence of its nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline}** Although this policy of secrecy has kept
Israel immune from international criticism to a great extent, scholars
debate the efficacy of this doctrine in contemporary strategic
environment.66 In the near future, Israel is likely to continue with its
policy of 'Amimut' or nuclear ambiguity though. No parallel regional
nuclear rival **[Israel has vowed that it will not permit another
nuclear rival in the region even if it entails a pre-emptive airstrike.
Not only has it destroyed nuclear sites and reactors of Iraq and Syria
in the past, but has also threatened to bomb the Iranian nuclear
facilities.]{.underline}** **[In case Iran definitively reaches closer
to making a nuclear bomb, or the hope for a diplomatic breakthrough
withers away, such a strike becomes extremely likely even though the
exact time of the strike remains contestable.]{.underline}**67 Holding
back from introducing nuclear weapons in the region Israel has also
reaffirmed that it would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons
in the Middle East, implying that it would neither be the first to
publicly acknowledge the existence of its nuclear deterrence, nor the
first to overtly test the device.68 This Israeli policy has helped it to
justify pre-emptive strikes against nuclear installations of other
regional states. Nuclear Harakiri **[Israeli nuclear deterrence is also
known by its alternate name, 'Samson Option', which implies, 'if we go,
everyone goes' or in other words it warns, "We \[Israel\] may have to
die, but this time we don't intend to die alone."]{.underline}**69
**[This concept of collective suicide comes from historical Jewish
tradition and perfectly adds to the credibility of nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline}** Nuclear doctrine **[Although Israeli nuclear
doctrine remains shrouded in mystery, the pattern of previous
Arab-Israeli wars illustrates that Israel would not hesitate to use
nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances as a last resort, regardless of
whether the adversary has a nuclear capability or not.]{.underline}**
**[Consequently, 'first use but last resort' remains the corner stone of
Israeli nuclear doctrine.]{.underline}**70 Israel has never acknowledged
its nuclear weapons capability. Therefore, it remains an extremely
challenging question whether Israel would resort to pre-emptive first
strike or not. Analysts and think tanks have concluded, however, that
using low yield (tactical) nuclear weapons in a pre-emptive strike
remains a plausible option for Israel.71 Pre-emptive and retaliatory
options **[Israel might use nuclear weapons in the following perceived
scenarios either in defensive or pre-emptive manner:]{.underline}**
Capture of a large area by an adversarial force advancing deep into
Israeli territory and populated areas; Successful annihilation of a
major portion of the Israeli air force; Substantial destruction of
Israeli cities in massive aerial attacks/strikes; Biological or chemical
attack over an Israeli city; Use of a nuclear weapon over an Israeli
territory; Perceived threat of a nuclear strike; Specifically targeted
strike on Israeli nuclear installations; **[Grave nature of risk, which
Israel considers as an existential threat]{.underline}**.

###  Yes Strikes -- Netanyahu 

#### Netanyahu and his advisors would lash out against Iran to secure Israeli power in the region, and it will be nuclear -- multiple layers of threat perception and risk assessment.

**Merom 17** \[Gil Merom works at the Centre for International Security
Studies (CISS) and Department of Government and International Relations
(GIR), University of Sydney. "The Logic and Illogic of an Israeli
Unilateral Preventive Strike on Iran." The Middle East Journal, Vol 71,
No 1, Winter 2017. //tjb\]

However, Netanyahu's words are often taken with a grain of salt in the
Israeli arena. In spite of bellicose rhetoric, his record of initiating
major military actions, particularly in comparison to his predecessors,
suggests relative restraint. Yet, **[the case of the Iranian threat is
unique.]{.underline}** As I explain elsewhere, **[the Israeli threat
perception of nuclear Iran has been broad, layered, and
deep.]{.underline}**[17](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f17)
[At a fundamental level, Israelis believe that the clerical regime can
be irrational or zealous enough to use nuclear capabilities in order to
destroy Israel even at the cost of assured Israeli
retaliation.]{.underline} Additionally, many Israeli officials perceive
other interrelated threats. **[First, they fear that a nuclear
Iran]{.underline}** \[End Page 90\] **[would usher nuclear proliferation
into the Middle East, which by implication would pit Israel against
multiple existential threats. Second, they fear a spillover of nuclear
weapons to terrorist organizations that are unrestrained by
international norms or by security instruments such as deterrence.
Third, they believe that possession of nuclear weapons would make Iran
and its proxies more aggressive, whereas Israel would lose its capacity
to regulate its environment with conventional force. Importantly, this
perception of multilayered threats resonates due to Israel's
anxiety-magnifying history and proactive strategic
culture]{.underline}**[18](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f18)
**[from which emerged the so-called "Begin Doctrine" that decrees an
Israeli preventive strike in response to a forming nuclear
threat.]{.underline}**[19](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f19)
**[Another way to think about Netanyahu's readiness to act against Iran
is to recall that alarmism, and even more so nuclear
alarmism,]{.underline}**[20](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f20)
**[often arises from and fuels an acute sense of
vulnerability]{.underline}**. The latter in turn invites
defense-motivated aggression --- that is, preemption. In short, an
interaction of proximate and fundamental perceptual factors in Israel
built striking momentum. Indeed, **[those familiar with Netanyahu and
his positions suggested that he was genuinely convinced of the possible
need to strike and was ready to act on his conviction.]{.underline}**
For example, former Israeli justice minister Yossi Beilin suggested
that, "Netanyahu and I talk\[ed\] about the issue \[of Iran\] for years
... he \[was\] utterly genuine. There \[was\] no manipulation ...There
\[was\] no wise game here. Netanyahu genuinely believe\[d\] that if the
Iranians acquire\[d\] a nuclear bomb, they would \[have\] drop\[ped\] it
on us ... from the point of view of a leader who \[thought\] as
Netanyahu \[did\], it would \[have been\] irresponsible not to
attack."[21](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f21)
Netanyahu's propensity to preventively strike was further fostered by
his attention to history. Zvi Hauser, Netanyahu's former Cabinet
Secretary (2009--13) and one of his closest confidants, explained that
Netanyahu \[End Page 91\] has a sense of historical mission and he
operates within a historical context. He ceaselessly corresponds with
the past and future. Therefore he evaluates every action he takes within
a historical perspective ... Netanyahu sees two matters: the
responsibility to safely navigate this ship \[i.e., Israel\] to the
shore, and the wish to go down in history as the one who navigated this
ship safely to the
shore.[22](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f22)
**[Hence Netanyahu's resurrection of the Iranian nuclear threat in the
context of the
Holocaust]{.underline}**,[23](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f23)
**[and his conviction that preventing Iran from becoming nuclear was his
calling and that it would carve him the place he deserved in Jewish and
Israeli history.]{.underline}** It is this combustible combination of
perceptions, persuasion, and ambitions that led Yuval Diskin, the former
director of the Israel Security Agency (ISA, known also as the General
Security Service due to its Hebrew name Sherut ha-Bitahon ha-Kelali, and
by its Hebrew acronym, Shabak, or the letters Shin Bet), to conclude
that Netanyahu was driven by "messianic" convictions and that in the
case of the Iranian issue, Netanyahu \[was\] haunted by Menachem Begin,
who attacked the Iraqi reactor, and by Olmert, who it was argued ...
attacked the reactor in Syria. \[He\] want\[ed\] to enter history as
someone who did something of this magnitude. More than once I had the
opportunity of hearing him downplaying what his predecessors had done,
saying that his mission --- Iran --- was something on a different
scale.[24](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f24)
**[Those who have doubted the significance of Netanyahu's perceptions
and his commitment to strike Iran's nuclear program should consider the
political capital he invested in the United States to advance his
Iranian agenda.]{.underline}** **[The most significant indicator was his
unprecedented readiness to repeatedly and brazenly confront Obama, the
leader of Israel's vital patron. Never before had an Israeli prime
minister been ready to intervene against an incumbent US president's bid
to secure a second term. Nor had any other Israeli prime minister ever
agitated so openly against an American presidential deal with a third
country. None had so boldly mobilized American Jewry (and Evangelical
Christians) to oppose a presidential initiative. And none whatsoever had
ever gone to Congress to blatantly try to defeat a Presidential effort
to garner Congressional ratification for an international
agreement]{.underline}**.[25](https://muse-jhu-edu.go.libproxy.wakehealth.edu/article/647577#f25)

###  Yes Strikes -- A2: Iran Deterrence

#### Iran would increase in aggressiveness if Israel lost US funding---this would result in a lash out from Israel.

vice dean for undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins University.

and the United States: Six Decades of Us-Israeli Relations*. Ed. Robert
O. Freeman. Routledge, 04/19/2018. P 170-171 //tjb\]

**[The view that Iran is well on its way toward acquiring nuclear
weapons capable of reaching Israel by a variety of means is not in
serious dispute.]{.underline}** The question remains, however, as to how
much of a threat to Israel's existence a nuclear- armed Iran would be.
After all, the United States has confronted nuclear adver- saries
throughout its history, with no major ill effects. These rivals included
the Soviet Union, which at one point aimed over 10,000 nuclear weapons
at the American heartland, and China, which had far fewer weapons but
was led by a radical regime that openly discounted the dangers of
nuclear war. **[Many scholars, most notably the political theorist
Kenneth Waltz, have argued that far from causing war, nuclear weapons
bring about peace.]{.underline}**15 [In this view, leaders recognize
that nuclear conflict with other nuclear-armed states would be suicidal
and therefore would never be undertaken. A nuclear-armed Iran may
bluster and posture, but at the end of the day, its leadership would
recognize that attacking Israel with nuclear weapons would mean the end
of Iran as a country, to say nothing of their personal demise as
well.]{.underline} Just as nuclear weapons helped keep the peace during
the tensest days of the Cold War, so will it do so in the Middle East of
today. **[There are many problems with this rosy scenario, most of which
stem from the view that the success of nuclear deterrence during the
Cold War might not apply to contemporary Iran.]{.underline}**
**[Deterrence will not halt an Iranian strike if the country's
leadership decides to launch a first strike that disarms Israel's
retaliatory forces. That Israel is a tiny country whose land-based
missiles and aircraft are concentrated in a relatively small area
supports an Iranian belief that a "disarming" first strike could be
achieved. Such a strike could come out of the blue but probably would
arise from some crisis.]{.underline}** One can envision a situation
where Israel and one of Iran's proxies, such as Hizbollah, were engaged
in a shooting war that threatened to escalate. **[Iran might then launch
its nuclear weapons first, especially if it believed Israel was
preparing to launch a strike on its own. Having two hate-filled
countries facing each other, each armed with nuclear weapons and each
believing it could disarm the other, is truly the mother of all
night-mares.]{.underline}** If Iran did launch first and successfully
disarmed Israel, little would stand in its way of finishing the job and
totally annihilating the Jewish state. [After becoming a nuclear power,
therefore, Iran could conceivably develop nuclear forces that threaten
Israel's retaliatory nuclear arms and, should the Iranians become
convinced that they have achieved a disarming first-strike capability,
there would be little to stop them from launching an
attack.]{.underline}

###  Yes Strikes -- A2: Israel Deterrence

#### Israel won't behave like a realist state -- Israeli leadership is likely to first strike Iran in the event of any threat of magnitude. 

**David 18** \[Steven R. David is a professor of political science and
vice dean for undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins University.
"Apocalypse Now?: The Iranian Nuclear Threat Against Israel." In *Israel
and the United States: Six Decades of Us-Israeli Relations*. Ed. Robert
O. Freeman. Routledge, 04/19/2018. P 185 //tjb\]

**[Although certainly possible, this realist prediction of Israeli
restraint may be wrong.]{.underline}** **[Most observers who see Israel
striking Iran argue that Israeli fears of Iranian irrationality, of Iran
not behaving like a "normal" state, will push Israel to attack. Less
attention is paid to the prospect of Israel departing from the norms of
expected behavior, acting in ways different from other countries that
have not shared its historical traumas.]{.underline}** In this view,
**[Israel is not like other nations. It was created in the aftermath of
the Holocaust with the mission of "never again" allowing the destruction
of the Jewish people to take place. Only seventy years after the
Holocaust, the leader of a hostile state is once more openly calling for
the extermination of 6 million Jews. Only this time, the Jewish people
have the means, however problematic, to prevent that threat from
happening. Seen in this light, the decision to launch an attack on
Iranian nuclear facilities appears virtually inevitable.]{.underline}**
The comforting realist vision of successful nuclear deterrence and
containment may indeed work for the United States, Russia, China, and
others. **[Nevertheless, if Israel and Iran are truly different, if they
are driven by demons that do not afflict much of the rest of the world,
then realist predictions of a peaceful stalemate will not apply to the
Israeli-Iranian relationship.]{.underline}**

#  Counterplan

##  1NC

#### Text: The United States federal government should amend various provisions of the Arms Export Control Act in order to reduce arms used against civilians, including: \--Clarifying the Arms Export Control Act's "legitimate self-defense" provision to rule out attacks on civilian-heavy areas and necessary infrastructure, \--Clarifying the Arms Export Control Act's "substantial violation" provision to include the killing of innocent civilians, \--Modifying the punishment of a substantial violation from a mandatory embargo to a temporary suspension, \--Implementing measures to increase public transparency and knowledge of what constitutes a violation of the Arms Export Control Act.

#### This maintains security commitments necessary in the region but creates oversight and deterrents which check Israel's violence.

IV\. [POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS The United States could reform the FMS program
by amending various provisions of the AECA. The proposed amendments in
this section will increase transparency, improve the likelihood of
enforcement, and reduce the participation risks for U.S. defense
contractors.]{.underline} The discussion in Part III of this Note
already highlighted some of the AECA\'s problems. [The ambiguity of
AECA\'s \"legitimate self-defense\" provision and \"substantial
violation\" provision give the United States too much leeway when
assessing potential violations.]{.underline} (193) [Additionally, AECA
imposes the drastic mandatory termination punishment for a \"substantial
violation.\" It imposes large costs on the United States by eliminating
foreign trade partners and invites retaliation from affected
countries.]{.underline} (194) Finally, the AECA\'s export-control
sanctions for violations impose a large financial burden on U.S. defense
contractors and punish them for the transgressions of others. A.
[Clarify Legitimate Self-Defense The United States could attempt to
clarify the AECA\'s \"legitimate self-defense\" provision.]{.underline}
In instances of aggressive conduct by a foreign nation, such as an
invasion in response to terrorism, the United States and the foreign
nation involved may offer differing opinions on whether the action
constitutes a necessary defensive measure. (195) Additionally, the
United States might not have access to the same information or
intelligence as the nation carrying out the operation\--potentially
leading to the United States determining the justifiability of the
actions based on different information. (196) [Although a precise
definition of legitimate self-defense remains too difficult to uniformly
apply, the United States could draft guidelines that help indicate what
conduct falls outside of its scope. Clear guidelines might help the U.S.
administration more easily assess whether goods potentially violated the
AECA. Additionally, increased transparency and public knowledge of what
conduct constitutes an AECA violation could pressure the United States
into consistently implementing the law and punishing aggressors.
Clarifying the legitimate self-defense provision might also create
better protection for defense contractors against public scrutiny.
Rather than wait and rely on a governmental decision on a potential AECA
violation, contractors might be able to assess AECA violations
themselves and thus choose to terminate sales to the perpetrator on
their own accord. B. Amend \"Substantial Violation\" Provision The
United States could also choose to clarify the AECA\'s \"substantial
violation\" provision. Not only does the vague term give the United
States too much discretion, but the lack of clarity also results in an
absence of any substantial violation determination over the years. The
United States overlooked instances in which foreign governments
committed egregious acts, including the killing of innocent
civilians.]{.underline} (197) [As a result of the United States\'
consistent failure to restrict access to the FMS program, the AECA does
not adequately deter foreign nations from aggressive conduct.
Additionally, U.S. companies can choose to continue selling to the
foreign nation involved without the fear of certain punishment. The
benefits previously discussed regarding a clarification of the
\"legitimate self-defense\" provision similarly apply here. A more
transparent definition of \"substantial violation\" would allow for
easier AECA assessment. Additionally, it would allow the public to
clearly tell if a substantial violation occurred\--giving it an
increased watchdog ability over the U.S. government. The United States
might have little choice but to apply the law justly with the additional
public oversight, no matter the ally or allies involved. Finally, U.S.
contractors would no longer exist in limbo on this issue. They would
have no legal choice but to comply with the AECA and terminate sales to
the violating nation. C. Modify Mandatory Termination The United States
could also choose to modify the punishment for a \"substantial
violation\" of the AECA shifting away from a mandatory embargo. The
mandatory embargo\--a rigid punishment\--can lead to foreign retaliation
and the loss of lucrative business relationships. Therefore, it is
unlikely that the United States will ever find that a substantial
violation occurred.]{.underline} (198) [However, by simply eliminating
the mandatory embargo, the United States would lose an important
deterrent against aggressive acts and violations of international
law.]{.underline} (199) [Thus, the United States could choose to modify
the punishment from a mandatory embargo to a temporary
suspension.]{.underline} (200) [The limited duration of a temporary
suspension might minimize economic damage to U.S. interests because the
United States would only temporarily lose out on important
relationships.]{.underline} Additionally, it might lessen the likelihood
of foreign retaliation. (201) Foreign nations may not seek retaliation
against the United States knowing that they do not face an indefinite or
lengthy ban from acquiring U.S. equipment. (202)

##  Solvency

###  Amendment Key -- Solves Israel-Iran Conflict

#### Amendment prevents anti-Israeli aggression and maintains US security in the region

**Bachar 17** (Ariel, Graduate of the George Washington University Law
School and Member of the Public Contract Law Journal "JCPOA:
Implications and Effects on Our Foreign Military Sales Program" *Public
Contract Law Journal* 46, no. 4, p. 890) NIJ

[Repealing QME legislation is not a viable option for the United States
because it would significantly reduce the abundance of aid that the
United States provides Israel. Israel relies on such financial and
military aid to maintain its strategic advantage in the Middle East. A
large reduction could have devastating consequences, thereby costing the
United States its stronghold in the region.]{.underline} (191) [Enemies
of Israel might engage in hostilities with the Jewish State, knowing its
weakened alliance with the United States.]{.underline} (192)

###  Amendment Key -- Checks Israeli Aggression

#### Clarifying would solve -- History proves.

**Bachar 17** (Ariel, Graduate of the George Washington University Law
School and Member of the Public Contract Law Journal "JCPOA:
Implications and Effects on Our Foreign Military Sales Program" *Public
Contract Law Journal* 46, no. 4, p. 883) NIJ

However, [the current framework renders an AECA assessment difficult.
First, a preemptive Israeli strike raises the question of whether the
action falls within the scope of the AECA\'s \"legitimate self-defense\"
provision.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [the AECA\'s drafters did not
define this language.]{.underline} (172) [As a result, the President, or
Congress, must determine the definition when evaluating a potential AECA
violation.]{.underline} (173) [This decision remains subjective because
not even international law scholars agree on a uniform interpretation of
the concept of legitimate self-defense.]{.underline} (174) [The lack of
a clear definition invites legal dispute as to whether a foreign country
violated the AECA\'s restrictions on the use of defense articles or
services.]{.underline} (175) [For example, following Israel\'s invasion
of Lebanon, in order to \"combat international terrorism\"]{.underline}
in May 1978, [the National Association of Arab Americans (NAAA) filed
suit in U.S. District Court.]{.underline} (176) [The NAAA sought to
enjoin the U.S. government from selling arms to Israel, claiming that
Israel became ineligible for aid when it used U.S.-supplied arms for
purposes other than legitimate self-defense.]{.underline} (177) [The
NAAA also sought to compel the United States to publicly rule on whether
Israel violated the AECA and to subsequently impose an arms
embargo.]{.underline} (178) [Although the NAAA eventually withdrew its
suit because Israel withdrew from Lebanon, similar litigation could
occur in the future in the event of an Israeli attack.]{.underline}
(179) [In 1981, the NAAA threatened to revive its former suit in
response to Israel\'s attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor.]{.underline}
(180)

###  Amendment Key -- Enforcement

#### Amending the AECA checks Israeli aggression---threat of losing weapons is sufficient. Only amendment ensures enforcement.

**Bachar 17** (Ariel, Graduate of the George Washington University Law
School and Member of the Public Contract Law Journal "JCPOA:
Implications and Effects on Our Foreign Military Sales Program" *Public
Contract Law Journal* 46, no. 4, p. 883) NIJ

[Previously, the United States overlooked potential Israeli violations
of the AECA. For example, in 2002, Israel used U.S.-provided F-16s to
destroy an apartment building in Gaza City, killing seventeen
Palestinian civilians.]{.underline} (106) [However, the United States
did not punish Israel for this incident.]{.underline} (107) [Even when
the United States found Israel responsible for some sort of wrongdoing,
it never invoked the AECA to terminate military aid to the Jewish
state.]{.underline} (108) [Instead, the United States elected to
temporarily suspend Israel\'s FMS involvement.]{.underline} (109) For
example, in 1981, Israel conducted a successful air strike using U.S.
planes on an Iraqi nuclear reactor in response to Saddam Hussein\'s
attempt to develop nuclear weapons. (110) The Israelis managed to
destroy Iraq\'s nuclear reactor before it became functional. (111) In
response, the United States chose to suspend, rather than cancel, the
delivery of arms previously contracted for sale to Israel. (112) [This
response left the door open for Israel to conduct similar operations in
the future without the fear of serious consequences.]{.underline} (113)
[Additionally, the United States has never found Israel or any other
country in \"substantial violation\" of the AECA, which would
potentially result from a \"substantial violation\" requiring the United
States to completely terminate the sale of arms and services to the
wrongdoer.]{.underline} (114) Complete termination becomes a costly
scenario because these kinds of major export-sanctions cause U.S.
companies to suffer long-term profit loss. (115) If the United States
completely terminated its current relationship with Israel, the U.S.
defense industry would face a yearly loss of over \$2 billion dollars.
(116) As one scholar noted, the U.S. military industry is \"accustomed
to billions of dollars in sales to Israel.\" (117) Even after the United
States eventually lifts the \"substantial violation\" sanctions it
places on a foreign nation, the damage on U.S. businesses would already
have been done. (118) Businesses would face costly fights to get their
goods back into the defense market. (119) Without competing with the
United States, foreign companies gain the ability to take control of
certain markets, thereby presenting a barrier for prospective
re-entrants. (120) [Additionally, the United States\' hesitation to make
substantial violation determinations may arise from fear of retaliation
because many countries see arms sales as a prerequisite for U.S. access
to military bases abroad.]{.underline} (121) In 1975, the United States
implemented an arms embargo on Turkey after it used U.S. weapons during
an invasion of Cyprus. (122) In response to the embargo, Turkey closed
27 U.S. military installations. (123) Turkey\'s actions severely hurt
U.S. intelligence capabilities because the United States could no longer
monitor Soviet communications from the Soviet Armenia, the Black Sea,
and the Eastern Mediterranean. (124) Additionally, Turkey repudiated a
defense agreement with the United States, choosing to instead acquire
its military equipment from the Soviet Union. (125) [These types of
retributive actions are costly to U.S. interests and may cause the
United States to err on the side of caution when faced with a potential
AECA violation.]{.underline} (126)

##  A2's

###  A2: Perm Do Both

#### Perm still links to the DA -- Amending the AECA doesn't restrict Israel's participation in the FMS.

**Bachar 17** (Ariel, Graduate of the George Washington University Law
School and Member of the Public Contract Law Journal "JCPOA:
Implications and Effects on Our Foreign Military Sales Program" *Public
Contract Law Journal* 46, no. 4, p. 874) NIJ

[A restriction on Israel\'s participation in the FMS program may
contradict current legislation committing the United States to annually
provide Israel with aid, thus helping Israel to maintain a qualitative
military edge in the Middle East.]{.underline} (16) Additionally, it
might negatively impact the U.S. defense industry, costing defense
contractors one of their largest consumers and creating long-term profit
loss. (17) [Conversely, failing to take action against Israel for its
potential questionable conduct can lead to both public scrutiny and
litigation against the U.S. government and defense
contractors.]{.underline} [To correct these issues, the United States
should amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).]{.underline} The
amendments proposed in this Note create a clear framework to punish
foreign purchasers for their acts of aggression using U.S. goods. The
increased transparency would allow defense contractors to more easily
assess potential AECA violations, helping to determine their desired
future course of conduct. Additionally, modifying the target of AECA
sanctions might reduce the inadvertent harms of the Act on U.S.
companies for the transgressions of other foreign nations.
