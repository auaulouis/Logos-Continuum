# Capitalism K Supplement

## A2 Perm

#### The permutation doesn't solve and only re-ifies the structure of capitalism

**Kovel '7** \-- (Joel, Distinguished Professor of Social Studies at
Bard College, "The Enemy of Nature- The End of Capitalism or the End of
the World?" pg. 151- 154) BC

[The monster that now bestrides the world was born of the conjugation of
value and dominated labor]{.underline}. From the former arose the
quantification of reality, and, with this, the loss of the
differentiated recognition essential for ecosystemic integrity; from the
latter emerged a kind of selfhood that could swim in these icy waters.
From this standpoint one might call capitalism a "regime of the Ego,"
meaning that under its auspices a kind of estranged self emerges as the
mode of capital's reproduction. This self is not merely prideful -- the
ordinary connotation of "ego- tistical" -- though [under
capitalism]{.underline} it certainly exhibits hubris; more fully, [it is
the ensemble of those relations that embody the domination of nature
from one side]{.underline}, and, from the other, [ensure the
reproduction of capital]{.underline}. This Ego is the latest version of
the purified male principle, emerging millennia after the initial crime
and reflecting the absorption and rationalization of gender domination
into profitability and self-maximization (allowing suitable
"power-women" to join the dance). [It is a pure culture of splitting and
non-recognition: it recognizes neither itself, nor the otherness of
nature]{.underline}, nor the nature of others. In terms of the preceding
discussion, it is the elevation of the merely individual and isolated
mind-as-ego into a reigning principle.37 [Capital produces egoic
relations, which reproduce capital]{.underline}. [The isolated selves of
the capitalist order can choose to become per- sonifications of capital,
or may have the role thrust upon them]{.underline}. In either case, they
embark upon a pattern of non-recognition mandated by the fact that the
almighty dollar interposes itself between all elements of experience:
all things in the world, all other persons, and between the self and its
world. Hence [nothing really exists except in and through
monetization]{.underline}. This setup pro- vides an ideal culture medium
for the bacillus of competition and ruthless self-maximization. Because
[money is all that "counts," a peculiar heartlessness characterizes
capitalists, a tough-minded and cold abstraction that will sacrifice
species]{.underline}, whole continents (viz Africa) or inconvenient
subsets of the population (viz black urban males) [who add too little to
the great march of surplus value, or may be seen as standing in its way,
or simply are suitable objects of demonization to distract the
masses]{.underline}. The presence of value screens out genuine
fellow-feeling or compassion, replacing it with the calculus of
profit-expansion. Never has a holocaust been carried out so
impersonally. When the Nazis killed their victims, the crimes were
accompanied by a racist drumbeat; for global capital, the losses are
regrettable necessities or collateral damage. [The value-term that
subsumes everything into the spell of capital sets going a kind of wheel
of accumulation, from produc- tion to consumption and back, spinning
ever more rapidly as the inertial mass of capital grows, and generating
its force field as a spinning magnet generates an electrical field. This
phenomenon has important implications for the reformability of the
system. Because capital is so spectral, and succeeds so well in
ideologi- cally mystifying its real nature, attention is constantly
deflected from the actual source of eco-destabilization to the
instruments by which that source acts]{.underline}. [The real
problem]{.underline}, however, [is the whole mass of globally
accumulated capital]{.underline}, along with the speed of its
circulation and the class structures sustaining this. [That is what
generates the force field]{.underline}, in proportion to its own scale;
and it is this force field, acting across the numberless points of
insertion that constitute the ecosphere, [that creates ever-larger
agglomerations of capital]{.underline}, sets the ecological crisis
going, and keeps it from being resolved. For one fact may be taken as
cer- tain -- that [to resolve the]{.underline} ecological [crisis as a
whole]{.underline}, as against tidying up one corner or another,
[is]{.underline} radically [incompatible with the existence of gigantic
pools of capital]{.underline}, the force field these induce, the
criminal underworld with which they connect, [and]{.underline}, by
extension, [the elites who comprise the transnational
bourgeoisie]{.underline}. And [by not resolving the crisis as a whole,
we open ourselves to the specter of another mythical creature, the
many-headed hydra that regenerates itself the more its individual
tentacle-heads are chopped away.]{.underline} [To realize this is to
recognize that there is no compromis- ing with capital, no schema of
reformism that will clean up its act by making it behave more greenly or
efficiently.]{.underline} We shall explore the practical implications of
this thesis in our final sec- tion, and here need simply to restate the
conclusion in blunt terms: green capital, or non-polluting capital, is
preferable to the ecodestructive breed on its immediate terms. But this
is the lesser point, and diminishes with its very success. For green
capital (or "socially/ecologically responsible investing") exists, by
its very capital-nature, essentially to create more value, and this
leaches away from the concretely green location to join the great pool,
and follows its force field into zones of greater concentration,
expanded profitability -- and greater ecodestruction.

#### The perm creates a hybrid of capitalism that prolongs capitalism's control. Only complete rejection of the aff can solve.

(István Mészáros is one of the greatest philosophers that the historical
materialist tradition has produced. His work stands alone today in the
depth of its analysis of Marx's theory of alienation, the structural
crisis of capital, and the necessary conditions of the transition to
socialism. He is professor emeritus at the University of Sussex, where

Perhaps **[the most effective way of postponing the historical \"moment
of truth\"]{.underline}** and **[thereby prolonging the dominance of
capital over human life, despite its growing destructiveness and
deepening structural crisis, is the hybridization of
capitalism]{.underline}**. This **[hybridization in capitalistically
advanced countries assumes the form]{.underline}** of the massive
injection **[of public funds]{.underline}** into the revitalization of
the pretendedly \"free market\" capitalist enterprises **[by the direct
involvement of the capitalist state.]{.underline}** This trend has been
demonstrated already at the time of the ­ subsequently quite easily
reversible ­ \"nationalization\" of large scale capitalist bankruptcy in
several vital economic sectors of Great Britain in 1945 by the Attlee
government of the \"old\" Labour Party, and not by \"New Labour.\" A
necessary **[postwar rescue]{.underline}** operation **[of British
capitalism was]{.underline}** characteristically **[misrepresented as
a]{.underline}** genuine **[socialist achievement]{.underline}**.22¶
**[This kind of operation is carried out in order to defend and secure
the continuing viability of the]{.underline}** established
**[reproductive order, thanks to]{.underline}** a great variety of
**[system­apologetic]{.underline}** ­ and in that sense politically
motivated ­ direct economic contributions by the state (from the funds of
general taxation, of course), about which Adam Smith could not even
dream. They range from the astronomical magnitude of the resources put
at the disposal of the military/industrial complex on an ongoing basis
to the trillions of dollars of financial rescue funds given to private
capitalist banks and insurance companies not only in 2008 and 2009 but
also in 2010, accepting liability to the tune of 90 percent for their
future losses.¶ In historical terms this is a relatively recent
phenomenon in the development of capitalism. Its potential extent and
significance were still very far from evident in Marx\'s lifetime. For
\"in the nineteenth century the possibilities of adjustment for capital
as a hybrid\' system of control ­ which became fully visible only in the
twentieth century ­ were as yet hidden from theoretical scrutiny.\"23¶ To
be sure, this **[systemic hybridization is]{.underline}** by now
**[overwhelmingly]{.underline}** **[important in
prolonging]{.underline}** the lifespan of **[the capital
system]{.underline}**. However, its modality of **[direct state
involvement in \"saving the system\"]{.underline}**24 ­ through the
transfer of immense public funds and even the full­scale
\"nationalization\" of ever more serious capitalist bankruptcy **[has
its own limits]{.underline}** and far­reaching implications for future
development, and therefore it **[should not be imagined as a permanent
structural remedy.]{.underline}**

## Root Cause of Militarism

#### Militarization is solely fueled by capitalism

**Kirp and Okazawa-Rey 2k** -- Kirk is on the organizing committee of
Women Cross DMZ and is a founding member of the International Women's
Network Against Militarism. Okazawa-Rey is a Professor at Fielding
Graduate University and one of the founding members of the International
Network of Women Against Militarism. (Gwyn and Margo, "Neoliberalism,
Militarism, and Armed Conflict," Social Justice, Vol. 27, No. 4 (82),
(Winter 2000), <http://www.jstor.org/stable/29768029>), RR

In the first article, Steven Staples argues that:

[The relationship between globalization and militarism should be seen as
**two sides of the same coin**.]{.underline} On one side,
[**globalization promotes the conditions** that lead to unrest,
inequality, conflict, and, ultimately, war.]{.underline} On the other
side, [**globalization fuels the means to wage war** by protecting and
promoting the military industries needed to produce sophisticated
weaponry. This weaponry,]{.underline} in turn, [is used or is threatened
to be used to **protect the investments of transnational corporations**
and their shareholders.]{.underline}

As several contributors note, colonial expansionism and the quest for
control of strategic locations historically have been a major
justification and impetus for military intervention. [Control over
scarce resources is an essential element in many contemporary conflicts.
The Persian Gulf War was about oil]{.underline}, as the U.S.
catchphrase, \"our oil is under their soil,\" made clear. Michael
Renner\'s list of international water disputes provides examples on
every continent (Table 1). These disputes are of varying intensity and
have not led to armed conflict in most cases, but the potential is
there. [Fighting between India and Pakistan over Kashmir,]{.underline}
for example, [which has been going on for over 50 years, concerns
control of this watershed region.]{.underline} Water allocation, water
diversion, and water rights are also key elements of tension in the
Middle East.

In the third article, Ian Smillie discusses [the role of the lucrative
diamond industry in war-torn Sierra Leone]{.underline}, noting that
diamonds -- small pieces of carbon with no great intrinsic value --
[have been the cause of widespread death, destruction, and misery for
almost a decade.\"]{.underline} He argues that [the point of this war
\"may not actually have been to win it, but to **engage in profitable
crime under the cover of warfare**.\"]{.underline} Although U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1306 bans trading in diamonds from areas
held by the Sierra Leone Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the RUF has
financed its military activities since 1991 by selling diamonds for
arms. Pressure on traders and consumers to avoid purchasing \"conflict
diamonds\" has led to recent efforts to reorganize the diamond trade
somewhat. Since the 1950s, Smillie notes, the government of Sierra Leone
has made no pretence of being able to provide security for mining
companies, and has required them to provide their own security. Talbot
comments on the role of privately held Military Protection Resource Inc.
in former Yugoslavia. Lochbihler (1999: 19) makes a more general point,
noting \"an increase in the dissolution of state structures, which also
means an erosion of the monopoly of violence by the state.\" This has
given rise to a \"new security industry\" comprised of paid military
experts and mercenaries who are \"of service to whomever can pay.\"

[In contrast to the neoliberal imperative for the transnational movement
of goods and profits, **borders between countries** of the global North
and South have become increasingly **militarized to control the movement
of workers**.]{.underline} For example, [the highly militarized
U.S.-Mexico border,]{.underline} discussed by Maria Jimenez in the
fourth article, [**keeps workers available for low-paid maquiladora
production** in Mexico although the North American Free Trade
Agreement]{.underline} (NAFTA) signed by the United States, Mexico, and
Canada [has reduced the impact of borders for the movement of goods.
Where countries of the North and South do not share a land border,
immigration policies in countries of the North are closely linked to the
labor needs of corporations, with work permits available for those with
appropriate education and skills.]{.underline}

The articles in Part I focus on connections among nation-states,
militaries, and corporations. [Staples uses the term
\"corporate-military complex,\" rather than]{.underline} President
Eisenhower\'s [\"military-industrial complex,\" as more accurate for
contemporary times.]{.underline} In an early draft of his speech on
leaving office in 1961, Eisenhower used the phrase
\"military-industrial-congressional\" complex, but dropped the reference
to Congress in the public version (Nelson, 2000: 6). [Lockheed Martin,
the largest weapons maker in the world, provides a current example of
these connections. The company received over \$18 billion in U.S.
government contracts in 1999, \$12.6 billion from the Pentagon and over
\$2 billion from the Department of Energy for nuclear-weapons
activities]{.underline} (Fischer, Sredanovic, and Massen, 2000). When
Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, [U.S. taxpayers paid \$1.2
billion for merger-related costs]{.underline} such as employee
relocations and plant closures. Lockheed Martin has given over \$1.6
million in Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions since 1997,
plus another \$500,000 in soft money to Democratic and Republican Party
committees; it also spent \$10.2 million on lobbying in 1997 and 1998.
Key Lockheed Martin company associates are involved at top levels of the
Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns and in foreign-policy
decision making. Many commentators have noted the weakening of the
nation-state as a corollary of increased corporate power. [Despite some
significant changes, we argue that **nation-states continue to fulfill
their major function: maintaining conditions for capital** accumulation.
Financing the military and, where necessary, generating strong
ideological support for it, whether by invoking patriotism,
ethnocentrism, or national security, is a crucial state
role.]{.underline}

[The military is both a state agency and a highly profitable sector
within industrialized economies due to weapons manufacturing and the
international trade in arms. Governments]{.underline} of countries with
arms industries [pay for weapons production twice over. Public funds
underwrite the often decades-long development process for complex
weapons systems]{.underline}, and governments are the sole customers for
them. Steven Staples argues that [the large U.S. military budget \"is
for all practical purposes a corporate subsidy\" siphoning public money
into private hands, and protected under]{.underline} Article XXI of [the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),]{.underline} which allows
\"governments free reign for actions taken for national security
interests.\" Staples argues that [with global economic integration the
\"weakened state no longer has the ability to reign in weapons
corporations and is trapped increasingly by corporate
interests]{.underline}: greater military spending, state subsidies, and
a liberalization of the arms trade.\"

Tamar Gabelnick and Anna Rich take up the issue of the arms trade in the
fifth article. They emphasize potential contradictions between security
policy and international arms sales, noting that [\"U.S. arms export
policy was established to protect national security, but has become
increasingly focused on commercial interests\" such that \"proposed
export reforms will lead to further loss of control over conventional
arms proliferation.\"]{.underline} An outcome of international sales is
that militaries can find themselves up against an enemy armed with
weapons provided by their own governments if political and military
alliances shift. This happened to Britain in the Falklands/Malvinas war
and to the United States in the Persian Gulf War. In an attempt to
reduce arms sales, U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has proposed a
Code of Conduct that would restrict the sale of arms to countries that
are \"nondemocratic, aggressors, human rights abusers, or not open about
their military spending.\" This is a step in the right direction, but as
Gabelnick and Rich suggest, it will need to be applied consistently to
have much impact. The definitions of nondemocratic, aggression, or human
rights abuse are open to interpretation. Russia\'s assurance, for
example, \"that it will not sell offensive weapons to Iran despite
\[its\] decision.. .to resume arms sales to Teheran\" (Reuters, December
7, 2000: A16) suggests a clear-cut distinction between offensive and
defensive weapons that may be meaningless in practice.

Many countries are involved in arms trading. Most people are killed by
small arms that are cheap and easily available worldwide, rather than by
highly sophisticated weaponry. A good deal of the cross-border trade in
small arms is illegal, but highly profitable for manufacturers, dealers,
brokers, shippers, and financiers (Lumpe, 2000). This trade is an
important way for poorer countries to earn hard currency to repay
foreign debt. Staples notes that [\"foreign embassies and trade missions
abroad are used to aid arms sales,\"]{.underline} a point reiterated by
Karen Talbot, who argues that [\"bombing and missile strikes, are, more
than ever, giant bazaars for selling the wares of the armaments
manufacturers.\" The Persian Gulf War and the bombing of Kosovo allowed
stocks to be displayed, tested, and reduced somewhat.]{.underline}
William Greider (1998) argues that [**there is no technical reason to
update U.S. weapons** -- the most sophisticated in the world -- **except
for the need for continued profits**. He notes that the biggest enemy of
future U.S. weapons production is the copious supply of weapons already
in existence; hence, the need to use them so as to justify continued
production.]{.underline}

#### Normative rejection doesn't mean immediate material change

[So a case can easily be made tha t white supremacy continues to exist
in a different form, no longer backed by law but maintained through
inherited patterns]{.underline} of discrimination, exclusionary racial
bonding, cultural stereotyping, and differential white power deriving
from consolidated economic privilege. 6 Kimberle Crenshaw emphasizes
(with specific reference to the United States, though the point is more
generally valid) the [importance of distinguishing between \"the mere
rejection of white supremacy as a normative vision\" and \"a societal
commitment to the eradication of the substantive conditions of Black
subordination.\"]{.underline} She notes that \"[a society once expressly
organized around white supremacist principles does not cease to be a
white supremacist society simply by formally rejecting those principles.
The society remains white supremacist in its maintenance of the actual
distribution of goods and resources, status, and
prestige]{.underline}:\'7

## State Key to Challenge Cap

#### Leftist impulsiveness and rejection of institutions like the state foreclose the possibility of tangible change

**Goldmann, 13** -- MA, Political Economy, University of Auckland
(Bartek, "Social Movements and Contestation in Post-Crisis Capitalism: A
Case Study of Syriza," New Zealand Sociology, Vol. 28, No. 3, 123-125,

RR

From this perspective then, what is necessary is a type of resistance
that is based on free forms of association, and whose teleological
end-point is stateless society. Since state-power is doomed,
revolutionary social movements should withdraw from politics since it
has become (or perhaps always was) a corrupt theatre of domination and
pursue transformation through non-institutional avenues. As Thomas
[Frank points out, activists involved OWS as well as the Tea Party, have
been sensitive to anything they perceived as elitism or 'unnecessary'
hierarchy,]{.underline} adding that bureaucracy, routine and boredom are
"no way to fire the imagination of the world" (Frank, 2012). [Today's
activists seem to exhibit an aversion to state power and to authority in
general; vanguardism and leadership are defined as the problem, and
hierarchy is identified as the opposite of creativity. They prefer to
occupy spaces at the peripheries of the state]{.underline} (parks and
other public commons), and [to directly transform the texture of social
life in an organic manner. The reasoning is that]{.underline} it is
these [everyday practices of]{.underline} cohabitation and
[deliberation]{.underline} that [sustain the entire social
structure.]{.underline} Such were some of the foremost concerns of the
Occupiers of Zuccotti Park. [However in retreating to the peripheries
outside of the administrative ambit of the state, and by levelling their
critique primarily at a cultural-discursive level,]{.underline} the
[protestors fail to engage the state-capital]{.underline} nexus directly
[on]{.underline} the [planes that really matter: ownership over the
means of production, consumption, environment etc. The]{.underline}
**[left has a tendency to become impulsive and enamoured by the
transformative potential of anything that promises radical social
change, and risks falling into an "infantile radicalism"]{.underline}**
(Saad-Filho, 2013). [With all the capacity for incisive and penetrating
critique, it appears to be completely unable to put itself under the
microscope and recognize]{.underline} the [enchanting fantasies and
ideological mystifications that structure its own field of
vision.]{.underline} Witness the enthusiasm with which so many narrated
OWS and the Arab Spring as unprecedented and ground-changing events, for
example David Harvey's speech at Occupy London (Harvey, 2011). No doubt,
[it is difficult to not be enthralled by the potential of such a
mobilization after a prolonged period of economic recession and
political inertia]{.underline}. It would appear that the [transformative
potential]{.underline} of the movements, the [Evental symbolism which
has inspired people]{.underline} in distant locations, [**is at the same
time hamstringing the prospects for actual political gains and change**
that is durable and entrenched in civil society. A buzz-kill like Žižek
is]{.underline} sometimes [completely necessary to burst the
bubble:]{.underline} "We have a nice time. But remember, [carnivals come
cheap. What matters is]{.underline} the day after, [when we]{.underline}
will have to [return to normal lives. Will there be any changes
then?"]{.underline} (Žižek, 2011). [His remarks to the OWS campers are
even more relevant now than before.]{.underline} In the following
section I will identify and demonstrate the [tendencies in Greek
society]{.underline} that might [provide a realistic, politically
attractive alternative to the current post-democratic inertia and the
prospect of another decade of austerity,]{.underline} which certain
politicians and economic 'pragmatists' claim to be the only viable
solution. This will be done by overviewing Syriza's politics and noting
its position on two key topics: its economic programme, and its role
towards the European Monetary Union (EMU).

#### Specific concrete actions through the regulatory state are necessary for resistance against neoliberal ills

**Peck & Tickell, 94** -- Research Chair, Urban and Regional Political
Economy and Professor, Geography, University of British Columbia AND
Professor, Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London
(Jamie and Adam, "Jungle Law Breaks out: Neoliberalism and Global-Local
Disorder," Area, Vol. 26, No. 4, December,
http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20003479.pdf, RR)

[If]{.underline} as we have argued [neoliberalism is socially,
economically and geographically unsustainable, the search for
an]{.underline} after-Fordist [institutional fix continues.]{.underline}
We maintain that [a coherent fix]{.underline} is a necessary, but in
itself insufficient, prerequisite for the restoration of sustainable
accumulation. It must meet the following minimum requirements. First, it
[must prevent the regulatory undercutting that is becoming a feature of
national and regional competition]{.underline} (see Leyshon 1992), which
renders regional economies vulnerable to the vagaries of capital and
undermines social contracts. Second, it must [mitigate and contain
uneven development, which]{.underline} both [disenfranchises poor
regions and places unsustainable pressures on growth areas.]{.underline}
Thirdly, it must have the capacity to control the global financial
system, perhaps the defining feature of the Bretton-Woods settlement.
Fourthly, and most importantly, it must be sustainable in social and
ecological as well as economic terms. This calls for putative solutions
based at different spatial scales. Many of these will require regional,
national and supra-national co-operation. Local [strategies]{.underline}
have a role, but this [must be within a supportive national and
supra-national framework. Local development cannot and should not be the
concern]{.underline} of local people alone; [nor]{.underline} should it
[be seen as the remedy for all social and economic ills. It needs to be
embodied in a larger policy framework]{.underline} that includes
supra-local considerations and objectives, as well as links with
supra-local actors. Local development does not imply the deactivation of
higher levels of governance; it does not mean simple \' decentralization
\' in the sense of replacing national level organization of govern ment
with local. Rather, it means developing local policies to complement
national ones as part of coordinated, multi-tiered approach . . .
Resource inputs need to be supplied both locally and from higher levels.
Otherwise, there is a strong risk of highly uneven and unequal
development among regions and areas (Sengenberger 1993, 324, 327).
[Local strategies will not realise their potential if they are
formulated in the context of the self-destructive processes of
beggar-thy-neighbour competition and regulatory undercutting. As long as
neoliberalism prevails]{.underline}-with its emphasis on competitive
relations, individualism and the fast buck-sustainable growth will be
difficult to attain. In the continuing disorder of the after-Fordist
crisis, localities\' place in the sun is likely to be increasingly
short-lived. Attracting growth may be difficult, keeping it will prove
harder still. In the face of systemic instability at the level of the
global economy, claims that a new global-local order has emerged seem
premature, not to say misfounded. The nation-state may have been eroded
from above and from below, but the nature of this erosion has been
different in each case. Below the nation-state, local regulatory systems
(particularly local states) have been conferred responsibility without
power: regulatory responsibilities have been handed (or have drifted, as
they have been shunned by nation-states) down from the nation-state
level, but localities can wield little in the way of political-economic
power in the context of globalising accumulation and global
deregulation. Above the nation-state, [supra-national regu latory
systems have inherited power without responsibility:]{.underline}
remaining wedded to a neoliberal [agenda, they continue to fuel global
economic instability]{.underline} with apparent disregard for its
damaging effects on national and local economies and its pernicious
ecological and social consequences. Workable after-Fordist regulatory \'
solutions \' at the national or local scales are unlikely to stabilise
until there is a truce between the \' hostile brothers \'. [The pressing
need,]{.underline} then, [is for a new]{.underline} supra-local
[regulatory framework.]{.underline} Of course, we are not suggesting
that some Bretton Woods II would provide the solution to the world\'s
problems, that it would guarantee sustainable growth, but it would be at
least a start. [It would provide a basis for halting the neoliberal
spiral of regulatory degradation. Global financial
institutions,]{.underline} then, [must be harnessed and
reformed,]{.underline} a process **[which will require concerted action
through nation-states. It is consequently important that the
nation-state is not written off as a site in this regulatory
struggle]{.underline}** (see Gertler 1992), for [this is likely to
remain the principal scale at which democratic control and political
power can be (re)coupled.]{.underline} True, the nation-state may have
become \' hollowed out \' during the after-Fordist crisis, but [a
resolution to]{.underline} this [crisis]{.underline} may-perhaps
[must-involve some degree of \' filling in \' of the nation-state in
order to effect a stabilisation of]{.underline} local-local and
local-global [regulatory relations. Solutions to]{.underline} the crisis
of [uneven development]{.underline} in after-Fordism [are unlikely to
come from the bottom-through local competition-but instead must begin
with action from above-through national]{.underline} and global
[co-ordination.]{.underline}

#### Evaluate this debate with the goal of making revolution -- the only role for intellectuals in the face of capitalism is to produce knowledge that informs revolutionary tactics -- any other role feeds back into the maintenance of capitalism by eschewing proletarian consciousness

Multitude of Possibilities: The Strategic Vision of Antonio Negri and

[Communism]{.underline} will remain associated with many of the horrors
of the twentieth century. Yet the term [is still used and understood as
a name for the continuing proletarian revolution.]{.underline} A
\'communist revival\' in the English speaking academy has been indicated
by the manifesto of students who occupied the University of California,
Santa Cruz last year (Communique from an Absent Future: 2009) and the
thousand participants in 2009 who paid to attend the \'Idea of
Communism\' conference at the University of London. My use of the word
\'communism\' is influenced and inspired by such actions as well as by
Hardt and Negri\'s commitment to struggle over the meaning of words that
have a powerful heritage and profound significance to the proletariat.
Of course, [the word is often linked to previous or existing \'communist
states\' and \'communist parties\'.]{.underline} However, I agree with
Hardt and Negri that [these states and parties are generally
manifestations of state capitalism rather than of communism. The errors
and defeats of previous communist experiments and the dead hand of
capitalist forms of praxes calling themselves communist continue to
weigh heavily on the proletariat, making it difficult to speak of
communism without \'corpses in our mouths\'. **Reclaiming and speaking
of communism in a positive sense recognises the genuine communist
heritage, which opposes authoritarianism, repression, war and terror,
and illuminates its praxes of freedom, democracy, peace and
love.**]{.underline} [Communism has been the enemy common to many
neo-liberal, social democratic, fascist and socialist regimes and those
identified as communists have been targeted and murdered in their
millions during the global class war to break proletarian
power]{.underline}. Today these communist victims and the victims of
\'communism\' \'haunt the world\'. But communism is not a ghost, not
even \"a positive ghost\" (Negri in Casarino and Negri: 2008: 200),
rather [communism is a movement, or movement of movements, and is very
much alive. It is this living movement of movements that continues to
threaten, challenge and go beyond capital.]{.underline} When I began
this thesis, the world was at war and the people of the globe had been
told: \"Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists\" (Bush:
2003). As terror and fear spread, there were growing threats to
\'academic freedom\' and \'freedom of speech\' from those backing the
Bush administration\'s agenda. When Negri was invited to speak at an
academic conference in Sydney in 2005 he was publicly denounced as a
terrorist in and by major media outlets and the event was cancelled (see
Chapter One). Just as Negri was dragged in I977 from the academy in a
previous \'state of emergency\', to rot in jail under preventative
detention for alleged terrorist activity, in the current global \'war on
terror\' others have fallen victim to a continuous \'strategy of
tension\'. Dr Andrej Holm and Dr Matthias B were arrested in Berlin in
2007 under anti-terrorist laws and alleged by police to have written, in
academic publications, \'phrases and key words\' also used by a militant
group and of being intellectually capable of authoring the group\'s
\'sophisticated texts\'. Liliany Oblando, a Colombian sociologist, was
charged in 2008 with \'rebellion\' and \'managing resources related to
terrorist activities\' while investigating right-wing death squads.
[Both within the academy and outside it, this is a dangerous time to
choose the latter option of \'either with us or against us\' and to
challenge those who seek to silence dissent, curtail critical debate and
label opponents of capital, war and repression as \'traitors\' and
\'terrorists\', while they defend an established order that is in fact
terroristic.]{.underline} Hardt and Negri (2004: 33) assert that today
[\"the majority of political scientists are merely technicians working
to resolve the quantative problems of maintaining order, and the rest
wander the corridors from their universities to the courts of
power]{.underline}, attempting to get the ear of the sovereign and
whisper advice\"- Negri has also argued that \"it is more interesting
and more useful to make revolution than to write about it\" (quoted in
Hardt: 2005b: 29). Yet Hardt and Negri (2009: 127) are interested in the
kind of [academic strategic investigations]{.underline} that [have
\"been forged by professors and students who take their work outside the
universities both to put their expertise at the service of the social
movements and to enrich their research by learning from the movements
and participating in the production of knowledge developed
there\".]{.underline} In order to learn from proletarian theory and
practice, throughout this thesis I provide in-depth analysis of Hardt
and Negri\'s writings and discussions about real world politics, while
testing their ideas out on various case studies. The thesis maps the
development of Hardt and Negri\'s thought by offering a [historical
analysis]{.underline} that [locates]{.underline} their [writings in
relation to class struggle a]{.underline}nd provides contextual analyses
of their key ideas. **[To avoid becoming fixated on the power of capital
requires a focus on how the proletariat\'s agency is a constituent
element of social processes.]{.underline}** Helping me to resist
becoming a technician of social order or an adviser to the sovereign, I
embark on this project as an active militant involved in class struggle.
Since \"it is not feasible to keep the values that a researcher holds
totally in check\", Bryman (2004: 21) argues that [a researcher\'s
politics will influence a whole variety of presuppositions that in turn
have implications for the conduct of the research.]{.underline}
Accordingly, Mies (1993: 68) advocates a \"conscious partiality\" in
conducting research, while Mitropoulos and Neilson (2005) argue against
\"the apparently objective space of an ivory tower-whose recourse to a
de-politicisation of knowledge marks the concealment of a politics\".
[Proletarian politics is compelled to an incessant process of polemic,
critique and intervention in social relations]{.underline} (Thobum:
2002: 453) [and my politics have, to a certain extent, determined and
will determine, my choice of research areas, choice of method, the
analysis and interpretation of data and the conclusions of the
thesis.]{.underline} My work is strongly inï¬‚uenced by my values,
beliefs, experiences and the methodological assumption that the
proletariat must free itself by [collectively breaking with
capital]{.underline}- Assisting this process, I believe, [requires a
mode of enquiry that promotes proletarian subjectivities]{.underline},
constructed on the multitude\'s movements of self-valorisation. [The
role of the communist intellectual is to embark \"on the project of
co-research aimed at making the multitude. The intellectual is thus not
\'out in front\' to determine the movements of history or \'on the
sidelines\' to critique them but rather completely \'inside\"\' where
strategic investigation can be \"a form of militancy\"]{.underline}
(Hardt and Negri: 2009: H8, 125). Marx\'s conception of proletarian
praxis, that is the relation of theory and practice, explains how change
comes about as people act and learn by taking action. \"Struggles are
the great teachers\" about social developments, the \"engines of
revolutionary theory\" (Negri: 2005b: xiii) and Hardt and Negri (2009:
I28) advocate the \"strategic production of knowledge\" through a
variety of routes as an \"active engagement with the production of
subjectivity in order to transform reality, which ultimately involves
the production of new truths\". They use the ideas of Raniero Panzieri
and Cornelius Castoriadis (in Hardt and Negri: 2009: 24) to explain that
\"although Marxism is born as sociology, [the fundamental task is to
translate that sociological perspective into not just political science
but really the science of revolution\" and \"revolutionary research
constantly has to follow and be redefined by the forms of social
movements\".]{.underline} Following this advice, I look to the social
movements of the multitude, to a wide variety of praxis as well as to
theory, to understand Hardt and Negri\'s strategic vision, interweaving
communist hypotheses with the proletariat\'s multitudinous struggles.

#### Every push for freedom and justice builds the strength of the anti-capitalist movement -- the struggle against capitalism creates the class to overthrow it

at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. "What Makes the Working Class a
Revolutionary Subject?"

**[What makes the working class a revolutionary subject? Not Hegelian
mysticism---that it is the universal class]{.underline}** or the vulgar
copy of the Absolute Spirit. **[Nor is the working class a revolutionary
subject because of its physical location---that it is strategically
placed to stop the wheels of industry]{.underline}**. From the sublime
to the crude---there can be little surprise that these explanations
convince few. Of course, **[there are some who had better explanations
as to why the working class was revolutionary but who now say that the
working class's time has come and gone]{.underline}**. For instance,
**[some suggest that once upon a time, capital concentrated workers,
allowed them to come together and to organize and struggle; today,
though, capital has decentralized workers and turns them against each
other]{.underline}** in a way that prevents them from struggling
together. **[Once upon a time, the working class had nothing to lose but
its chains but now it has been absorbed within
capitalism]{.underline}**, is a prisoner of consumerism and its articles
of consumption own and consume it. **[Those who conclude that the
working class is not a revolutionary subject because capitalism has
changed the working class reveal that they do not understand the ABCs of
Marxism. The working class makes itself a revolutionary subject through
its struggles---it transforms itself]{.underline}**. That was always the
position of Marx---his concept of "revolutionary practice," which is the
simultaneous changing of circumstances and self-change. **[The working
class changes itself through its struggles. It makes itself fit to
create the new world]{.underline}**. But why do workers struggle?
**[Underlying all the struggles of workers is what Marx called the
"worker's own need for development."]{.underline}** We know that Marx
understood that wage struggles in themselves were inadequate. But not to
engage in them, he recognized, would leave workers "apathetic,
thoughtless, more or less well fed instruments of production." In the
absence of struggle, Marx argued that the workers would be "a
heartbroken, a weak minded, a worn-out, unresisting mass." **[Struggles
are a process of production: they produce a different kind of worker, a
worker who produces herself or himself as someone whose capacity has
grown, whose confidence develops, whose ability to organize and unite
expands]{.underline}**. But why should we think this is limited to wage
struggles? **[Every struggle in which people assert themselves, every
struggle in which they push for social justice, every struggle to
realize their own potential]{.underline}** and their need for
self-development, **[builds the capacities of the actors]{.underline}**.
And, **[those struggles bring us up against capital]{.underline}**. Why?
Because **[capital is the barrier that stands between us and our own
development.]{.underline}** And it is so because capital has captured
the fruits of all civilization, is the owner of all the products of the
social brain and the social hand, and **[it turns our products and the
products of workers before us against us---for one sole purpose, which
is its own gain, profit. If we are to satisfy our needs]{.underline}**,
if we are to be able to develop our potential, **[we must struggle
against capital and, in doing so, we working people create ourselves as
revolutionary subjects]{.underline}**. But who are we? What is this
working class that is the revolutionary subject? You will not find the
answer in Das Kapital. Marx's Capital was not about the working
class---except insofar as the working class was an object. **[What
Capital explains is the nature of capital, its goals and its
dynamics]{.underline}**. But it only tells us about the working class
insofar as capital acts against the working class. And, insofar as it
does not present the working class as subject, it also does not focus on
the way in which capital struggles against this subject. So, we have to
look elsewhere in Marx for his comments about how the capitalist class
maintains its power by dividing and separating workers (specifically
Irish and English workers). And, although Marx explicitly commented that
"the contemporary power of capital rests" upon the creation of new needs
for workers, there is no place where he explored this question. Thus,
this critical question of the nature of the contemporary working class
is one for which **[the answers will not be found in a book. We must
develop the answers ourselves. Who is not-capital today?]{.underline}**
Who is separated from the means of production and must approach capital
as a supplicant in order to survive? Surely, it is not only those who
sell their labor power to capital but also those unable to sell their
labor power to capital---not only the exploited but the excluded. And
**[surely, it includes those who, in the context of a massive reserve
army of the unemployed, work within the sphere of circulation of capital
but are compelled to bear the risks themselves]{.underline}**---i.e.,
those who struggle to survive in the informal sector. **[They may not
correspond to that stereotype of the working class as male factory
worker, but that stereotype was always wrong.]{.underline}**
