[[The transatlantic relationship has always involved questions
about]{.mark} future trends and [risks. **However,**]{.mark} **the
aftermath of [Brexit and the]{.mark} US [election in]{.mark} November
[2016 has]{.mark} [pushed uncertainty to a new
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** [[Political]{.mark} goals and
even shared [principles appear]{.mark} to be [up for
renegotiation]{.mark} in the transition period [from]{.mark} the [Obama
to]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration. [On the European
side]{.mark}, the British vote to leave looms large, [populism is on the
rise]{.mark} across the board, and [many citizens are]{.mark} still
[suffering from]{.mark} the [ongoing]{.mark} economic and financial
[crises.]{.mark}]{.underline} Where do we go from here? [[In the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, the [direction of foreign policy seems
uncertain now that]{.mark} Donald [Trump has won]{.mark} the
Presidential elections (Jervis et al., 2017).]{.underline} Scenarios in
many forms have been presented to make sense of what could be ahead in
US foreign policy -- and its meaning for the transatlantic relationship
(see, for example, Ischinger, 2016). [At the time of writing, [Trump's
effect seems impossible to predict]{.mark} with any degree of
confidence; and perhaps [this caution is warranted considering]{.mark}
that [his electoral]{.mark} [victory had been]{.mark} [deemed]{.mark}
next to [impossible by geopolitical experts]{.mark} (Bremmer & Kupchan
2016, p.]{.underline} 23). The goal of this article, however, is to look
beyond the immediate consequences of a new US administration. We focus
here on trends and scenarios for the next decade of transatlantic
relations. The scenarios discussed in this article reflect the
discussions at a number of workshops held in Berlin in 2015 and 2016.
Participants in these workshops -- organized as part of the Dahrendorf
Forum's foresight project -- exchanged ideas about future EU relations
with the United States, but also other key actors in the world (Sus &
Pfeifer, 2016). We followed the logic of multiple scenario generation
(see Burrows and Gnad, this issue). First, the participants discussed
basic assumptions about the nature of transatlantic relations. Second,
under the guidance of the scenario facilitators we identified key
drivers for the relationship between the two regions. As a third step,
small working groups were formed to develop scenarios based on the most
relevant pairs of key drivers identified in the plenary discussion.
Finally, the most analytically interesting and policy-relevant scenarios
were then selected by the whole group and developed further.
[[Transatlantic cooperation plays a key role in]{.mark} many arenas of
[global governance]{.mark}, such as the G7 and G20, the UN Security
Council, and of course NATO. Together the United States and the European
Union account for 12 per cent of the world population and roughly half
of global (nominal) GDP as well as military expenditures. At the same
time, [there is a sense]{.mark} that the [transatlantic
dominance]{.mark} of world politics [has peaked]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Given the global economic and demographic trends as well as recent
experiences of political disagreements, [policymakers in the EU and US
are]{.mark} well [advised to think about priorities and pitfalls for
future cooperation]{.mark} (Tocci & Alcaro 2012, pp. 2--9). **Next to
the electoral surprises of 2016, [a number of indicators suggest trouble
ahead]{.mark}: [Negotiations about TTIP are at a standstill]{.mark}.
[The capabilities]{.mark}, financing and mission statement [for NATO are
unclear]{.mark}. And beyond such regional concerns, [climate change and
other global issues have made it]{.mark} abundantly [clear]{.mark} that
[transatlantic cooperation]{.mark} and leadership [are neither an
automatism nor always sufficient]{.mark} to shape the global agenda in
the twenty-first century.**]{.underline} Against this backdrop, we
present and discuss four scenarios for the coming decade of
transatlantic relations. These are not meant to comprehensively cover
all possible outcomes. They rather represent a selection of important
developments and policy implications. In the following section we
discuss the key drivers identified by the participants of the scenario
workshop. In the main part of the article we then present the resulting
four scenarios: The first scenario sketches a mode of highly selective
transatlantic cooperation; in the second, the EU reluctantly assumes a
global leadership role; the third scenario focuses on the common
perception of an external threat; the fourth addresses the consequences
of transatlantic disagreement regarding technological innovation. We
close with a brief discussion of common themes and implications.

#### Trump's abnormal leadership makes *[reinforcing trust especially necessary]{.underline}*

[[NATO's]{.mark} single [greatest challenge is]{.mark} the [absence of
strong]{.mark}, principled [American presidential leadership for the
first time in]{.mark} its [history]{.mark}. President Donald [Trump is
regarded]{.mark} [widely]{.mark} in NATO capitals [as the Alliance's
most urgent]{.mark}, and often most difficult[, problem.]{.mark} [NATO
leaders]{.mark}, for example, [considered not holding a 2019
summit]{.mark} to mark the seventieth anniversary this spring as they
did in decades past.]{.underline} They feared President Trump would blow
up a meeting in controversy as he has sdone each time he has met with
NATO leaders during the past two years. [Wary of his past behavior, NATO
plans a scaled down leaders meeting for December 2019. President
[Trump's open ambivalence]{.mark} about NATO's value to the U.S., his
[public]{.mark} [questioning of America's Article 5 commitment
to]{.mark} its [allies,]{.mark} persistent [criticism of
Europe's]{.mark} democratic [leaders and embrace of]{.mark} its
anti-democratic members and continued weakness in failing to confront
NATO's primary adversary President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} of Russia,
[have **hurtled the Alliance into its most**]{.mark} **[worrisome crisis
in memory.]{.mark}3 [There is no reason to believe]{.mark} President
[Trump's attitude will change]{.mark} for the better during the next two
years**]{.underline}. He believes NATO allies are taking advantage of
the U.S.4 These are the same allies and partners who came to America's
defense on 9/11, suffered more than 1,000 battlefield deaths alongside
American soldiers in Afghanistan,5 are fighting with the U.S. now
against the Islamic State and shoulder the main burden sustaining a
fragile peace in the Balkans, in both Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
[President Trump is the first U.S. president to view the European Union
as an economic competitor rather than a vital partner of both the U.S.
and NATO. **[His troubling anti-NATO]{.mark} and anti-Europe [bias has
caused European governments to question the credibility of the U.S. as
the leader of the West]{.mark} for the first time since the Second World
War.**6 The European public confidence in American leadership is also at
historically low depths.**7 [Every]{.mark} American [president
before]{.mark} Trump [has encouraged]{.mark} the strength and
[unity]{.mark} of Europe as a core interest of the U.S. [Trump may well
cause]{.mark} even [greater damage]{.mark} to the Alliance [while he
remains in office]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For this reason[, Republicans
and Democrats in Congress must act together as a blocking force against
President Trump's dangerous policies]{.underline}. [**[Congress,]{.mark}
on a bipartisan basis, [should reaffirm]{.mark} the [U.S.
commitment]{.mark} to the Article 5 defense clause in the NATO
Treaty**.]{.underline} Congress should pass legislation this year
requiring Congressional approval should President Trump attempt to alter
U.S. treaty commitments to NATO allies or to have the U.S. leave the
Alliance altogether.8 Congress should continue to fund the "European
Deterrence Initiative" to bolster U.S. military strength in Europe that
is the primary deterrent against Russian adventurism.'

#### Lack of negotiation on defense spending is hurting relations with NATO

**Shapiro,** nonresident senior fellow in the Project on International
Order, **18** (Jeremy,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/09/trumps-meaningless-nato-spending-debate/)

as in a bad marriage, the arguments of U[.S. President Donald Trump and
his European partners have descended into a sort of ritual
exchange]{.underline}. So at this week's NATO summit, we can be
confident that [Trump will complain about the **lack of European defense
spending** and **threaten to leave** Europe if the **NATO** allies don't
stump up]{.underline}. The Europeans will accept the premise of his
argument, point to what they have recently achieved, and pledge to do
more. The whole affair has the structure of an Apprentice episode. We
don't know what crazy s\*\*t Trump will say during the show, but we know
how it will end. Such burden-sharing debates are traditional at NATO
meetings. The main difference now is that Trump has an advantage in
pushing Europeans to spend more relative to past U.S. presidents.
Because [he doesn't care about the trans-Atlantic alliance, he can more
credibly threaten to withdraw the U.S. security blanket from
Europe]{.underline}. And because Europeans still rely on U.S. security
guarantees for their defense, they feel that they simply can't risk it
and so do their best to satisfy his demands. It is a reasonable
response. European and American experts alike, including [Trump's
staunchest foes, admit that the president has a point and that Europeans
should spend more on defense]{.underline}. They often note that every
U.S. administration since the 1950s has a made a similar demand of the
Europeans. And so the hope is that if Trump's gonzo tactics get the
allies to finally open their coffers, the alliance will be better off
for the effort. MONEY FOR NOTHING Alas, those who would advise Europeans
to accede to Trump's demands are not really paying attention to what
Trump says he wants and how he operates. Sure, there are good reasons
for Europeans to spend more on defense (though even here the issue is
really spending more wisely rather than spending more). But regardless,
there is no satisfying Trump's demands about European spending. The
European response to Trump's histrionics over spending is nearly
irrelevant to how his administration will treat the alliance. In fact,
we have already seen a fair degree of effort to respond to Trump's
critique. [European defense spending is creeping up---27 of 28 members
of NATO are now increasing their defense spending,]{.underline} eight
will meet the 2 percent target this year, and 16 countries are on track
to meet it by the agreed date of 2024. Trump could simply declare
victory, claim that he has achieved what all past presidents
(particularly Barack Obama) had failed to do, and go home, leaving NATO
to go about its boring daily routine defending of Europe and supporting
America's wars abroad. But he probably won't. It seems clear at this
point that Trump does not want to solve the burden-sharing problem. On
the contrary, he wants to use Europeans' collective sense of guilt over
their lack of spending, as well as [the European fear of American
abandonment, to gain concessions on what really matters to
him]{.underline}: reducing the American trade deficit. Indeed, at the
summit, he may explicitly link a continued American security guarantee
with economic concessions from Europe. [Trump's focus on trade means
that Europe cannot]{.underline} conceivably [meet his demands on defense
spending]{.underline}. If the Europeans parked a brand-new aircraft
carrier off the coast of Mar-a-Lago and tossed the keys onto the 18th
green, Trump would simply charge them greens fees. In the end, he
doesn't believe in the idea that America should defend Europe, so why
should the United States pay anything at all? He is only interested in
it if it brings in a profit. So every time Europeans respond to his
repeated blandishments on defense spending with new pledges to pay more,
he seems to grow ever more sure that he is on to something and doubles
down on his critique. One feels confident at this point that such
critiques will persist at least as long as the U.S. trade deficit with
Europe. APPEASING A BULLY Appeasement of Trump's bullying is not the
right strategy. Of course, Europeans need to get their house in order in
defense. [But that effort has little to do with symbolic defense
spending targets and even less to do with the impossible task of
satisfying Trump.]{.underline} Rather, they should focus on creating a
truly independent defense capability. That effort probably does involve
more spending, but more importantly it means creating a European
military capability that can stand on its own. Such [a capability will
allow the Europeans to **negotiate with Trump**, and future American
presidents,]{.underline} from a position of equality.

### S -- Binding/Genuine Consultation Key

#### Genuine consultation is key to strengthen NATO -- ensures they have the ability to take a decisive role in crisis

**Dempsey 16** --  nonresident senior fellow at Carnegie Europe and
editor in chief of Strategic Europe. (Judy, 12.08.16, "From Suez to
Syria: Why NATO Must Strengthen Its Political Role,"
<https://carnegieeurope.eu/2016/12/08/from-suez-to-syria-why-nato-must-strengthen-its-political-role-pub-66370)>
np

What prompted the Report of the Committee of Three, also known as the
Three Wise Men's report, was the Suez Crisis. [On]{.underline} October
29, [1956]{.underline}, [France and Britain---without consulting
NATO]{.underline} as a whole or the United States in
particular---[joined forces with Israel to invade Egypt to secure the
Suez Canal]{.underline} as an open trading and commercial route. The
[invasion was a political defeat for France and the United
Kingdom]{.underline} (UK). [It was also a major blow for NATO,
as]{.underline} two of [the organization's leading]{.underline} European
[members had refused to consult]{.underline} or cooperate [with
this]{.underline} young transatlantic [alliance]{.underline}. As the
report bluntly stated, "[an Alliance in which the members ignore each
other's interests]{.underline} or engage in political or economic
conflict, or harbour suspicions of each other, [cannot be effective
either for deterrence or defence]{.underline}. Recent experience makes
this clearer than ever before." The signal that the Suez debacle sent to
the Soviet Union greatly worried the three authors of the
report---Canada's Lester B. Pearson, Italy's Gaetano Martino, and
Norway's Halvard Lange (see figure 1). While there was some hope of a
thaw after the death in 1953 of the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, the
authors cautioned against complacency. "We must remember that the
weakening and eventual dissolution of NATO remains a major Communist
goal," they wrote. [The]{.underline} Three Wise Men's [proposal that
NATO members use the alliance for genuine consultation]{.underline} and
cooperation [on issues of common concern was not fully
implemented.]{.underline} But the days are long gone when a NATO
ambassador could believe that any member state could go its own way on
defense issues or take a view of politics that is detached from the
security environment. As the Three Wise Men's report pointed out, "some
states may be able to enjoy a degree of political and economic
independence when things are going well. [No state,]{.underline} however
powerful, [can guarantee its security and its welfare by national action
alone."]{.underline} After all, as the authors insisted throughout their
report, NATO is not just a military organization---it is also a
political one. But the political dimension is so often sidelined. This
is a mistake: at a time when defense, security, and politics are so
closely intertwined, [NATO needs to articulate its political side
without hesitation]{.underline}. [Yet to this day, the alliance shies
away from discussing controversial issues, from speaking and acting
politically]{.underline}, and from taking a stance. To reinforce its
political dimension and its commitment to collective defense, NATO needs
to take seriously the concept of resilience, shore up its relationship
with the European Union (EU), and improve communication by getting out
of the alliance's Brussels bubble. These are important political steps,
the pursuit of which is crucial to make NATO fit to deal with the
threats facing the Euro-Atlantic community. DEFINING A POLITICAL ROLE
FOR NATO NATO needs a clearer political role. First and foremost, that
concerns the political obligation of all members to collective defense,
a point that cannot be stressed enough. This obligation---enshrined in
Article 5 of NATO's founding Washington Treaty, which states that an
attack on one ally is an attack on all---is NATO's cornerstone and
raison d'être.2 Yet there is a political necessity for all member states
to reinforce this obligation in words and actions. This is because some
allies, for example the Baltic states, are increasingly nervous and, at
times, even doubtful about the political willingness of other members to
defend them in case of an attack, most likely by Russia. NATO is going
to need a great deal more political assurance from the incoming
administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that it is committed
to collective defense. Second, NATO is going to need a great deal more
political assurance from the incoming administration of U.S.
President-elect Donald Trump that it is committed to collective defense
and, by implication, to NATO. This commitment has to be backed by strong
military capabilities---and by a rapid reaction to threats faced by
member states. The ability to react rapidly is now accepted in NATO,
even if the military commitment and resources to protect the Baltic
states and Poland is far from adequate. For the moment, political
commitment has become the number one priority for NATO's Eastern
members. NATO has another political role to play: ensuring resilience.
All NATO members face challenges. Some have been attacked by terrorists
who have caused many civilian casualties. Other NATO countries have been
threatened or intimidated by Russia or have had to cope with large
numbers of immigrants. Many allies must contend with the increasing
negative and dangerous impacts of cyberwar, hybrid warfare, and
disinformation, which have the potential to make democracies highly
vulnerable. And populist movements tap into citizens' fears, which are
often fueled or intensified by social media and disinformation.
Resilience, which is mentioned in NATO's founding treaty, has several
aspects. Among the most important is a readiness to respond immediately
if civilian or military infrastructure is attacked. This requires NATO
to work politically with the EU to ensure that the continent is able to
recover quickly in the event of this kind of attack or any kind of
destabilization. In this case, having a political role means being
prepared, developing a plan, having already conducted exercises, having
worked closely with partners, and having established seamless lines of
communication with all NATO member governments as well as with their
relevant civilian authorities. NATO gave resilience some prominence in
the conclusions of its July 2016 summit in Warsaw. Now, resilience
should become part of the alliance's strategy and culture, instead of
being ad hoc. Resilience is neither exclusively military nor exclusively
civilian. It spans both---that is, it is political, which is why NATO
has to embrace a stronger political role. This role should not become
subject to bureaucracy, committees, or endless haggling about what
should be on the agenda of the North Atlantic Council (NAC), NATO's main
decisionmaking body. Anyone who works in NATO knows how the organization
can be debilitating at times and then, in rare moments, suddenly
creative and flexible. Resilience means being prepared to manage and
respond to crises whose responses cannot be held up by committees. More
broadly, a political role means that the alliance must become a forum
for open dialogue about major issues. It must reach out to other
international organizations and engage the public, including by
explaining what resilience means and how it is linked to security and
defense. NATO must have information and communications systems in place
so that the public recognizes what is happening in the case of an attack
and why action has to be taken. A more political role for NATO is going
to require a determination from the secretary general's office and from
all member countries, particularly the United States. America's role
must not be underestimated: Washington is the guarantor of Europe's
security and the biggest financial and military contributor to NATO. It
has protected Europe since 1949---and in that time, the European members
of NATO have taken that protection for granted. Trump could change that
imbalance. During his election campaign, he called NATO "obsolete."3 He
has since modified his views: on November 18, 2016, he spoke with NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to reaffirm the "enduring importance"
of the alliance.4 Whatever policies Trump adopts in office, it is clear
that America's relationship with NATO is no longer predictable. But what
any U.S. administration says about NATO matters. If Washington does want
to reassure its allies, the new administration should use the NAC to
explain its position and begin open discussions about security
challenges and political trends facing the alliance. Discussions about
political issues have to take place in the knowledge that the United
States is fully committed to collective defense. If that is in any
doubt, then the very existence of NATO could be called into question. As
the Three Wise Men's report stated, "the first essential . . . of a
healthy and developing NATO lies in the whole-hearted acceptance by all
its members of the political commitment for collective defence, and in
the confidence which each has in the will and ability of the others to
honour that commitment if aggression should take place." DIVISIONS OVER
A POLITICAL ROLE During many interviews, some on the record, others not,
analysts were divided over whether NATO should have a political role.
One argument against such a role is that NATO should focus on ensuring
collective defense and on being a military alliance. "Russia is the big
threat," said John Lough, a Russia and Eurasia expert at Chatham House.
"Russia is even preparing for war. NATO is not prepared. We have one
almighty problem on our hands."5 Another security expert, Roland Paris
of the University of Ottawa, said, "NATO is the West's security
architecture. It already faces enough challenges and is overstretched on
operational grounds. I'd be wary about taking the military dimension too
far into the political realm."6 Others say that NATO is already
political---that it assumed that role in 1989 when the Berlin Wall was
torn down and Europe was reunited. During the 1990s, NATO was
preoccupied with ending the wars in Yugoslavia and with preparing the
former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the
Baltic states, for alliance membership. Both tasks were highly political
in nature: they were about reuniting Europe. Even so, NATO's political
role was not complete. "Since 1989, all kinds of discussions have taken
place," said Paal Hilde of the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies.
"But there are limitations. Iran and Syria have not been discussed. . .
. There are lots of political issues \[on which NATO members\] are not
necessarily in agreement. As for energy security, this is a big issue
\[but\] there is no clear role for NATO. NATO can't do anything on the
supply side. This is a political issue. . . . It would be a real
challenge for NATO if our energy were cut off," he added.7 The issue of
energy security points to the broader concern of resilience. If the
infrastructure of any NATO member is damaged to the extent that it could
paralyze the country's economy or harm its citizens, NATO needs to be
able to react quickly to support and, if need be, defend that member
state. There are also analysts who believe that pragmatism must be the
driving philosophy. In this context, they argue, NATO and the EU have to
cooperate because they share the same values. NATO has a political role
in articulating those values. "Look at Chapter IV of the Three Wise
Men's report," said Luciano Bozzo of the University of Florence. "The
authors write about the sense of community, of common values, of joint
NATO actions. Who cares whether that should be the role of NATO or the
EU? As it is, Europe is falling apart. The transatlantic relationship is
under huge stress. In this regard, we need to strengthen NATO's
political role. That means defending our common cultural values and way
of life. NATO can do this because it is a more efficient organization
than the EU," Bozzo added.8 Divisions over this issue are not new. NATO
has always been plagued by disagreements about whether it should have a
political role. "[NATO's future was assured only when]{.underline} the
[Allies demonstrated]{.underline} [its continued vitality as a military
instrument in a]{.underline} new [strategic environment]{.underline},
dealing with non-Article 5, out-of-area contingencies," Frédéric Bozo of
the University of Nantes argued over a decade ago. "[In the absence of
such a demonstration, seeking to rejuvenate NATO]{.underline} at the
time by 'politicising' the organisation [would simply have led to the
creation of a \[talking\] shop."]{.underline}9 Another talking shop is
exactly what the Three Wise Men's report wanted to avoid, because the
authors knew that it would not address the need for genuine and
transparent political discussions and consultations. [It was the lack of
consultation]{.underline} and the scant regard for smaller members of
the alliance [before]{.underline} and after [the Suez Crisis that threw
open the question of a political role for NATO]{.underline}. It seemed
that some allies were more equal than others and could pursue their own
military agendas. As the report stated, "[a member government should
not, without adequate advance consultation, adopt firm policies or make
major political pronouncements on matters which significantly affect the
Alliance or any of its members]{.underline}, unless circumstances make
such prior consultation obviously and demonstrably impossible." [The
Suez Crisis rocked the credibility of the alliance]{.underline}. It also
left France and Britain with fundamentally different perceptions about
the roles of the United States and NATO. "The UK learned to never leave
the side of the United States. . . . The French learned to never trust
the British nor rely on the Americans," Daniel Keohane of the Center for
Security Studies in Zurich has argued.10 [And the crisis damaged NATO
unity at a time when the alliance was involved in a military and
ideological confrontation]{.underline} with the Soviet Union. The Three
Wise Men's report was published just two months after the Kremlin sent
Soviet troops into Budapest to crush the anti-Communist Hungarian
Uprising. The foreign ministers who authored the report pulled no
punches about the atmosphere in the alliance after the Suez Crisis.
"[The practice of consulting has not so developed in the NATO Council as
to meet the demands of political changes and world trends]{.underline},"
they wrote. "[The present need]{.underline}, therefore, [is more
than]{.underline} simply [broadening the scope and deepening the
character of consultation]{.underline}. [There is a pressing requirement
for all members to make consultation in NATO an integral part of the
making of national policy.]{.underline} [Without this the very existence
of the North Atlantic Community may be in jeopardy. .]{.underline} . .
[There cannot be unity in defence and disunity in foreign
policy]{.underline}." Strong words, but did they have an enduring
impact? It seems they did not. Some NATO ambassadors and officials have
argued that controversial issues, such as the wars in Iraq and Syria,
Iran's nuclear program, and Europe's refugee crisis, have nothing to do
with NATO.11 They have further argued that these are issues for national
leaders and foreign ministers to take care of, and not for NATO. That is
sidestepping the issue. One main reason for not wanting candid debates
about such topics is the instinctive reflex that doing so would open up
divisions in the alliance. Several of the big NATO countries can block
honest and open discussions or have the political clout to start them.
In both cases, large member states are in a much stronger position than
smaller ones to set the agenda. This can have a debilitating if not
demoralizing impact on smaller countries. Furthermore, some NATO
members, for example Germany and Turkey, have an instinctive fear and
suspicion that once the NAC discusses political or controversial issues,
there is an underlying military agenda. This worries many of the
alliance's European members.12 Europeans were right to suspect this
might happen in 2002 when the United States was considering ways to
overthrow the then president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein. Bitter shouting
matches ensued between the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Nicholas Burns, and
his French counterpart, Benoît d'Aboville.13 Germany, France, and the
Benelux countries, supported by Russia, which all opposed U.S. plans to
invade Iraq, attempted to establish a European defense structure
independent of NATO. Yet the majority of European countries were not
prepared to destroy the transatlantic alliance or have Europe go it
alone. It took several years to heal the wounds in NATO. [A strong
political role for the alliance also helps shape strategy]{.underline}.
In retrospect, [the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War]{.underline} and the way
the campaign was conducted [should have persuaded NATO of the need for
genuine political consultations]{.underline}, independent of a military
agenda. However, the opposite happened: the war did not embolden
individual NATO countries to raise other political and strategic issues,
such as the disastrous aftermath of NATO's short military operation in
Libya in 2011. [Nor has NATO been prepared to discuss Iran, the Sahel,
Somalia, or the impact of climate change]{.underline} on the
Euro-Atlantic community. [As for the U.S. shift toward the Asia-Pacific
region or tensions between the United States and China over]{.underline}
Beijing's efforts to control [the South China Sea, NATO has been all but
silent on these major political issues. This silence implies a lack of
strategic thinking a]{.underline}bout whether NATO has any role to play
in these fields as well as a serious lack of ambition. NATO'S
NONPOLITICAL RESPONSE TO THE REFUGEE CRISIS [Throughout 2014 and 2015,
Europe faced an inflow of refugees not seen since the end of World War
II.]{.underline} The majority were fleeing the wars in Syria and Iraq,
where the self-proclaimed Islamic State had taken over parts of the
countries. Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants reached Europe
at great risk, crossing the Western Balkans before passing through
Hungary and Austria, on to Germany. [The pressure on the Western Balkan
countries was so great that instability and a backlash against the
refugees were waiting to happen. Yet NATO remained largely on the
sidelines.]{.underline} The [influx]{.underline} challenged Europe's
basic principle of solidarity and [exposed yet again NATO's reluctance
to think politically and strategically.]{.underline} Indeed, it took
many months for the NAC even to put the refugee crisis on its agenda.
NATO members either did not believe the crisis had anything to do with
the alliance or did not want to think outside the box and realize that
the refugee crisis was not confined to the political and civilian
realms.14 There was also a consensus that this was an EU problem. In any
case, the migration issue had and continues to have complex security
implications for Europeans and for the transatlantic relationship. [The
migration issue]{.underline} had and [continues to have complex security
implications for Europeans]{.underline} and for the transatlantic
relationship. When the refugee crisis boiled over in 2015 in a way that
led to deep divisions in Europe, with some countries such as Hungary
building high barbed-wire fences to keep refugees out, NATO was silent.
The alliance seemed almost indifferent to a problem that had the
potential to undermine the stability of some of its member countries.
[Greece]{.underline}, for one, [was under immense pressure]{.underline}.
An EU and NATO member, it was already trying to overcome a devastating
economic crisis that had shaken the foundations of the EU's single
currency, the euro. Athens was forced to introduce highly unpopular
austerity measures as a precondition for receiving financial assistance.
At the same time, it had to cope with tens of thousands of refugees
landing on its islands or reaching the Greek mainland in the hope of
moving on to other EU countries. [Turkey]{.underline}, a leading NATO
member and an EU candidate country, [was under pressure too, sheltering
over 2 million Syrian refugees]{.underline} as of October 2015.15
Stoltenberg [wanted the alliance to play some kind of political and
civilian role in helping the refugees]{.underline}, but he knew that
reaching consensus in the NAC to involve NATO would be difficult.16 This
was despite the fact that [the organization has a toolbox to deal with
such civilian crises.]{.underline} The alliance has a Civil Emergency
Planning Committee, and its role is unambiguous. According to the
committee's website, "[Civil Emergency Planning provides NATO with
essential civilian expertise and capabilities in the fields of terrorism
preparedness . . . humanitarian and disaster response and protecting
critical infrastructure.]{.underline}"17 [The alliance also has a
Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center]{.underline} based
at its headquarters in Brussels. The center is meant to cooperate with
the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
and other international agencies. [This center was not involved during
the thick of the refugee crisis.]{.underline} And NATO has a Civil
Emergency Planning Rapid Reaction Team, which is designed to evaluate
civilian requirements and capabilities to support a NATO operation or an
emergency situation such as the Western Balkans were facing during the
refugee crisis. Again, there was no evidence of the rapid reaction team
being activated.18 "There was no political will to ask how NATO could
get involved in some way, even though Stoltenberg at times felt very
frustrated about NATO's lack of response," an alliance diplomat said off
the record because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.
The diplomat added that NATO should have used its civilian toolbox to
help deal with the refugee crisis.19 The unremitting flow of refugees
passing through or stranded along the Western Balkan route required a
special response. Because the civilian, security, and armed forces in
these countries were (and still are) poorly equipped and trained to deal
with such emergencies, NATO could have compensated for these shortfalls
in several ways. The alliance could have assisted in bringing order and
security to the borders. Such assistance could have comprised logistics
and personnel to provide stability for the authorities and safety for
the refugees. The alliance could also have provided emergency facilities
such as housing and field hospitals. It could have worked with the
overstretched Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees to help register refugees and issue them with identity papers.
And NATO could have offered transportation to take refugees to other
countries in Europe. In retrospect, because Western Balkan states and
Greece were struggling to cope, they should have called in NATO to help.
Greece, as a member state, was certainly entitled to do so---as was
Turkey. [NATO did not deploy its tools, because doing so would have
meant giving the alliance a political role.]{.underline} But the
enormous scale of the challenge made it a political task. Again, there
was a cultural reflex in NATO that once an issue was discussed from a
political point of view, it was assumed to have military ramifications.
In addition, some members wanted to believe that the EU would be able to
deal with the crisis---although it was clear from early on that the bloc
was not equipped to cope with security issues, border management, or
humanitarian questions. This is where [NATO's political role could have
made a difference: it would have been tangible and would have had an
impact. A NATO role in helping deal with the refugee crisis]{.underline}
in the Western Balkans, Greece, and Turkey, apart from reducing the
immense strain on these countries, [could have improved NATO's image and
demonstrated that it was not merely a military organization. It would
have shown that NATO could project stability and assistance and could
help manage a crisi]{.underline}s. That is what the allies agreed to do
at their July 2016 summit in Warsaw: "The Alliance must and will
continue fulfilling effectively all three core tasks as set out in the
Strategic Concept: collective defence, crisis management, and
cooperative security. These tasks remain fully relevant, are
complementary, and contribute to safeguarding the freedom and security
of all Allies."20 In the end, in February 2016, after requests by
Germany, Greece, and Turkey, NATO decided to join international efforts
to deal with the refugee crisis.21 NATO ships are now trying to stop
illegal trafficking and irregular migration in the Aegean Sea through
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance at the Turkish-Syrian
border. And in a sign of cooperation with the EU, NATO is liaising with
the union's border management agency, Frontex, which is now attempting
to secure the EU's external frontiers. NATO's Operation Sea Guardian,
which is deployed in the Mediterranean to perform a range of maritime
security tasks, will support the EU-led mission EUNAVFOR Med, also known
as Operation Sophia.

#### Historical examples prove NATO is angered by lack of prior consultation

perspective on NATO under Trump: lessons of the past and prospects for
the future)//EF

The importance of NATO and the US relationship with the countries of
western Europe was further underscored in an address given by Kissinger,
in which he said: 'The President believes that our relations with
Western Europe are of overriding importance---because they are the
oldest and closest allies and also because a stable world is
inconceivable without a European contribution.'12 In fact, according to
documents mined from the Nixon Foundation, the trip to Europe was an
important part of Nixon\'s (and Kissinger\'s) pursuit of the
administration\'s strategic vision and larger foreign policy goals.
Shortly after returning from that trip, at the 20th anniversary meeting
of NATO in Washington DC, Nixon asked for the creation of 'a committee
on the challenges of modern society ... to explore ways in which the
experience and resources of the Western nations could most effectively
be marshaled toward improving the quality of life of our peoples' and to
help twentieth-century man to learn 'how to remain in harmony with his
rapidly-changing world'.13 [[The]{.mark} subsequent [creation of
the]{.mark} Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society ([CCMS) was
designed]{.mark}, in conjunction with the Harmel Report, [to ensure
NATO\'s]{.mark} [relevance]{.mark} in a changing world, at least from
the US perspective.14 In many ways, [the underlying goals]{.mark} of the
CCMS [stressed]{.mark} the importance of [Article 2 of the]{.mark} NATO
[Treaty with]{.mark} [its emphasis on cooperation]{.mark} and friendly
political and economic relations,15 and the belief that the strength of
the alliance depended as much on the vitality of the individual member
states as on their military strength.]{.underline}16 According to
Nichter, the CCMS 'marked a formal entrance of the alliance into the
area of détente'.17 [More important, perhaps, is that Nixon used his
European trip and subsequent call for the creation of the CCMS to stress
the need for the allies to bear a greater share of the common defense
burden, a point that has been repeatedly raised subsequently, most
recently by Trump. [Furthermore, the idea was established that NATO
is]{.mark} not only a collective security agreement but also [a
relationship with]{.mark} the [potential to bind like-minded countries
together]{.mark} in any number of ways [for]{.mark} their [mutual
benefit]{.mark}. [Many of Nixon\'s policies outraged]{.mark} and further
estranged the [other members of NATO]{.mark}. An example of this is
[Nixon\'s decision in 1971]{.mark} to implement a radical change in US
monetary policy that resulted in the end of the Bretton Woods economic
system that had been in place since the end of the Second World War, **a
decision that [was made without adequate consultation]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} the [Euro]{.mark}pean
[nations]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}18 In effect, 'they were
supposed to be American allies, but they were not being treated like
allies'.19 As Nixon\'s larger strategic vision was being implemented,
the US relationship with Europe was eclipsed by other priorities[.
[While the]{.mark} Nixon [administration did attempt to repair]{.mark}
some of the [fractures]{.mark} it had created, these [moves were greeted
sceptically]{.mark} by European leaders who had seen this attempted
before.]{.underline} Simultaneously, political changes in European
countries, coupled with the movement towards enlargement of what was
then the European Economic Community, shifted attention away from the
United States. 'Over time, Europeans became frustrated with their
diminished place in American foreign policy'20 and this was a concern
that the Nixon administration did little to address[**. [This is]{.mark}
further [evidence of]{.mark} the emergence of [a dual pattern]{.mark}
[where]{.mark}by [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [pursued
policies]{.mark} deemed to be [in its own]{.mark} national [interest,
often at the expense of Europe]{.mark},** while at the same time the
European countries were developing their own policies, both individually
and collectively, that minimized or excluded the United
States.]{.underline}

#### Trump is disrupting collective security -- maintaining genuine consultation is key to Atlanticism 

**Rynning,** Professor of Political Science at the University of
Southern Denmark, **3-14-19** (Sten, Journal of Transatlantic Studies,
17:139-156, p. 152-153)//EF

However, continuity is unlikely to offer relief, as this analysis has
argued. [NATO consultations suffered after quite some enthusiasm in the
1990s when the Atlanticist prescription for cohesion was exported to
partners and friends. [Consultations were]{.mark} particularly [strained
during]{.mark} the early phase of [the War on Terror when the
US]{.mark}A [decided to invade Iraq]{.mark}. [When]{.mark} the [allies
decided to zoom in on]{.mark} the good war in [Afghanistan,]{.mark}
[they found a]{.mark}n engagement so tough that [strategy Americanized,
and consultations withered]{.mark}.]{.underline} The return to Europe in
2014 offered limited relief as Russia annexed Crimea and introduced a
revisionist element in European politics, as China in a more gradual
process gravitated toward the center of the American security agenda,
and as **[[the Trump presidency disrupted]{.mark} longstanding
[collective security]{.mark} [priorities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What
Europe wants politically from Russia, and what it has to offer the USA
in the bigger Eurasian game, are questions that the European allies now
confront and lack strong answers to[. **[Absent]{.mark} such [answers
there is a real risk]{.mark} that [Atlanticism will corrode
further]{.mark}**. The USA might continue taking the lead in deterring
Russia militarily, but [there is no substitute for]{.mark} shared
[political priorities and]{.mark} sustained [consultation in the
Alliance]{.mark}. In other words, **[NATO will not be fine as long as
the US]{.mark}A [desire it;]{.mark}** it must involve a collective sense
of political purpose.]{.underline} If NATO cannot give political meaning
to itself, outside powers will be emboldened in their attempt to sow
seeds of division. In 1958 Paul-Henri Spaak spoke of trouble in the West
resulting from "static" and "faint-hearted" foreign policies; some 60
years later these words once again, and from a NATO perspective,
regrettably, ring true. Atlanticism can yet prevail, but it will require
a bold engagement on the part of NATO allies with their collective
raison d'être in a future shaped by rising Eurasian powers.

#### Prior consultation is crucial to trust and alliance credibility

Third, [[NATO has to find a]{.mark}]{.underline} proper [[balance
between its function as a hub and a spoke]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the field
of counterterrorism and [stabilization efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the South. [Joining [flexible]{.mark}]{.underline} and issue-based
[cooperative [security initiatives]{.mark} [with]{.mark} other
international organi- zations and [partner states allow NATO]{.mark}
members [to diversify]{.mark} their [approaches to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} highly [[specific security challenges]{.mark} they
face.]{.underline} Although NATO did not play an active role in the
Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in its initial phase, the alliance's
Wales Summit in 2014 provided a public platform for its establishment,
and its Brussels headquarters served as the venue of the coalition's
first meeting. On the one hand, [the risk of a trade-off between
involve- ment and duplication looms large]{.underline}, especially [in
the current field of capacity building, with allies being engaged
through different NATO, EU, coalition, or bilateral
formats.]{.underline} Operational learning has to be ensured. On the
other, [while NATO can certainly not solve all allies' security issues,
constant [coor- dination and deliberation need to take
place]{.mark}]{.underline} in the North Atlantic Council [[to
maintain]{.mark} sufficiently high levels of alliance [cohesion and
understanding]{.mark}.]{.underline} [A]{.underline} "multi-speed"
[[NATO]{.mark} [with]{.mark} a heavy [emphasis on EU
members]{.mark}]{.underline} of the alliance [[could
exclude]{.underline}]{.mark}, e.g.,
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}---[which doesn't have an operational
agree- ment with Europol yet]{.underline}---[[from intelligence]{.mark}
[sharing]{.mark} schemes]{.underline} in [order to regulate and manage
the flow of returning foreign fighters [and could have substantial
trust-eroding effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[The same goes
for]{.mark} unilateral [counterterrorism operations without prior
consultation]{.mark} or subsequent transparency and coordination [with
allies]{.mark},]{.underline}** as happened earlier this year in Northern
Syria.

Especially with the military campaign against ISIS winding down and
substantial transatlantic tensions over the future of the JCPOA deal,
the Southern flank is unlikely to dominate the agenda of the upcoming
NATO summit in July. Neverthe- less, [NATO would be---when addressing
the need for a new strategic concept---well advised to reflect and seek
paths forward in order to maintain alliance cohesion. NATO should
identify its purpose as an organization beyond being a mere and
increasingly lesser institutionalized hub for coalitions of the
willing]{.underline}.

### S -- Consultation Solves

#### NATO sustainability depends on *[collective decisionmaking]{.underline}* 

**Deni,** PhD, **03-18-19** (John R., Professor of Joint, Interagency,
Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) Security Studies at the U.S.

[In spring 2019, NATO foreign ministers gathered for a 70th anniversary
summit and, once again, committed the Alliance to strategic relevance
and impact.**1 There is no comparable case of alliance longevity among
sovereign countries---all other alliances in history have typically
ended after the security threat they created to manage dissipated or was
defeated**]{.underline}. As the articles of this special issue make
clear though, [NATO continues tSo be a valuable security provider for
its numerous member states. No country that has joined NATO has ever
left it, and there continues to be a waiting list to get into the club.
How has the alliance managed to not simply endure but to thrive over
this lengthy time period?]{.underline} Several material and ideational
factors compete to explain alliance duration, but individually these are
only of limited utility in explaining NATO's continued strength and
vitality. Some scholars have attempted to build NATO-specifc models of
endurance, but even these are of limited value. [This article will
assess NATO's adaptation since 1990 to identify the key factors shaping,
driving, propelling, and threatening NATO's endurance. Whether NATO will
make it to the 80th anniversary of its founding is likely to be **a
function of its ability to pursue what might be considered the
traditional security agenda of collective defense** while simultaneously
pursuing a less traditional security agenda of crisis management beyond
member state territory and cooperative security with partners in Europe
and beyond. The central argument of this article is that explanations
for NATO's endurance must include consideration of the fact that the
alliance's missions, activities, and issue areas---what might be
considered collectively NATO's repertoire---have expanded over time, and
that **this expansion has been pivotal to convincing member states of
the alliance's enduring value.**]{.underline} Generally, the expansion
of NATO's repertoire occurred in two phases[. The first unfolded during
the nearly quarter century of the post-Cold War period, from 1990 until
early 2014 and Russia's invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The
second has been going on since 2014. In both periods**, changes in the
alliance's repertoire reflected a combination of evolving interests of
the member states** and the addition of new member states with interests
of their own. The paradox confronting the alliance and its member states
is that it remains increasingly difficult from a material perspective
for NATO to achieve its objectives in both spheres---that is, in terms
of adequately deterring Russia and assuring the newest member states of
Eastern Europe, while simultaneously meeting the security demands of
other allies who fnd greater utility in NATO's role outside the realm of
territorial defense.]{.underline} To examine these issues further, this
article will first briefly summarize NATO's adaptation since the end of
1990, breaking down the last 29 years into two distinct period---the
frst from 1990 until Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and the
second from 2014 to the present. The article will then turn to surveying
what political science and history tell us about alliance duration, as
well as what these fields have to say specifically about NATO's
endurance. [Finally, the article will assess and analyze the historical
record from these two time periods---and especially NATO's willingness,
if not ability, to **expand its organizational repertoire**---in an
effort to better explain the alliance's continued
endurance.]{.underline}

#### The US is *[the backbone]{.underline}* of NATO operations -- the partnership is in everyone's *[mutual interest]{.underline}* 

**Thiem,** Military Professor at US Naval War College, 06-26-**14**
(Don, "NATO Renewed: Building the New Transatlantic Strategic Alliance,"
<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/03071847.2014.927998)//EF>

[Since the 'end' of the Cold War, even with the measured success of the
Alliance, **the existential question for NATO remains US
participation.** **Absent the US, NATO lacks the capability to conduct
synchronized high-end operations.**]{.underline} At home, though, the US
as a nation is predicated on business and a moral experiment. At its
most basic level, the strategic aim of the US is to create stable access
to goods, services and markets that allow for continued economic growth
in conjunction with expanded basic human-rights protection for all.
Absent a clear and present danger, defining and explaining the role of
NATO within this construct is challenging. Nonetheless, in an
interconnected global economy, NATO is highly relevant to this
refinement of assured strategic security. [The US involvement in Europe
since 1914 is a strategic aberration. A hundred years later, the US is
focused on pursuing its interests in Asia, and while Europe provides a
large market and economic trading partner, it is no longer the only
market. By 2050, Europe -- with a population of 593 million -- will have
fewer people than West Africa -- with an estimated 667 million people,
of which Nigeria alone will have 258 million -- and much fewer than
India, China, South Korea and Japan with a combined total population of
3.1 billion]{.underline}.3 This means that the economic and strategic
landscape of East Asia will also change correspondingly. In this
context, it is no surprise that to the average American, the last
century appears to have been a strategic interruption, and one being
paid for in Philadelphia, not Paris or Prague. Even at the height of the
Syria crisis last autumn, only 49 per cent of Americans saw NATO 'in a
favorable light'.4 [The strategic requirement for Europe, therefore, is
to convincingly show why the US still needs to be actively involved in
European security. NATO is and can continue to be relevant -- but it
needs a wide-eyed reassessment that embraces new security challenges and
opportunities.]{.underline} Why the US Needs (to be in) NATO NATO must
leave behind the '2 per cent, tanks, subs and nukes' paradigm and build
a non-linear strategic security alliance to seek out, address and track
threats, and then attack, deter, degrade or defeat them. [To protect
itself, NATO needs to be physically engaged outside the Alliance. The US
assesses that the primary threats to stability are not 'just' in the US
and Europe, but are transregional. The lifeblood of Europe is what moves
in and out of it. The British understood this 300 years ago and built a
navy to match. **Today, it is the US Navy which secures the high seas,
enabling Europe\'s prosperity** -- which is why it is so refreshing to
the US to see multiple partners in the EU-led, NATO-resourced
counter-piracy Operation Atalanta across entire swaths of the Indian
Ocean**. This offers an excellent paradigm shift for the future of
shared strategic security partnerships, and clearly demonstrates that
the 'old ways' no longer fit the current operating environment.** Others
will argue that the threats to Europe and the US alike are not
susceptible to kinetic means, but are more asymmetrical and ancient --
disease, pestilence, people smuggling -- as well as modern and nebulous
-- cyber, space, drugs. As Phil Williams has noted, pandemic disease,
economic instability and transnational criminal networks will pose
severe and direct challenges to US security interests.]{.underline}5 5
See Phil Williams and Vanda Felbab-Brown, 'Drug Trafficking, Violence
and Instability', Strategic Studies Institute, April 2012; see also
Stewart Patrick, 'Weak States and Global Threats: Assessing Evidence of
Spillovers', Center for Global Development, Working Paper No. 73,
January 2006. View all notes The US believes that, for security --
broadly defined -- the sine qua non is NATO, not the EU or other
constructs. [The Alliance offers an indispensable 'one-stop shop' for
**collective discourse and action.** The average American sees the EU as
an economic competitor for jobs and sales, whereas NATO members are
allies.]{.underline} However, while the US would rather deal with NATO
on strategy, this is a decision that can only be made in Europe, not in
Dayton, Ohio. The US sees complex challenges as prima facie evidence
that, in a European context, NATO must be the leader for strategic
security dialogue. The ability of the governments, leaders and forces of
NATO to work together, looking towards the Fulda Gap, and over the
horizon off the coast of Somalia and other out-of-area operational
areas, is unsurpassed[. The US needs NATO as a 'partner of choice' to
tackle a tough international strategic environment that will only get
more complex and dynamic in the decades to come -- Putin\'s Russia being
the latest example. The new 'normal' is not the Westphalian sanctity of
nation-states, but the security of their people]{.underline}. The
diplomacy and operational structure that brings NATO forces together for
exercises and operations builds a sophisticated approach that enables
the Alliance to address myriad challenges. [NATO may not be 'ready-made'
to fight all of these challenges, but the shared security culture and
processes, built over the last seven decades and honed in Libya, the
Indian Ocean and Afghanistan, provide a framework that is irreplaceable
and unmatched.]{.underline} The Alliance provides unity of effort and
consensus, two critical underpinnings to collective strategic security.
Selling NATO in the US is tough: a December 2013 Pew poll showed that a
majority of Americans believe that 'the U.S. should mind its own
business internationally'. **[However, the following challenges, grouped
thematically and not necessarily in order of priority, represent
compelling converging interests that European leaders must demonstrate
to the US as underscoring the importance of NATO.]{.underline}**

[While confronting Russian aggression and bolstering deterrence, NATO
must remain open to dialogue with Russia]{.underline} when it is in the
West's interest. [[Russia is a major]{.mark} European [power that must
be taken into account]{.mark}]{.underline}.68 First, [[dialogue is
fundamental to deterrence]{.mark}, [as Russia must]{.mark} clearly
[understand]{.mark} NATO's [intent and]{.mark} the [consequences of
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, [[even in]{.mark} a period of
[increased tensions]{.mark}, [there are topics for dialogue that serve
common interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The NATO-Russia Council
should]{.mark} continue to meet regularly to [address risk
reduction]{.mark} measures, [provide transparency on military
exercises]{.mark} [and exchange views on]{.mark} priority [political
issues]{.mark}, including the conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}. Allies
should press the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) to update the Vienna Document to improve predictability and
transparency of conventional forces in the region.69 Russia should
return an ambassador to NATO and NATO should re-open military-military
contacts below the four-star level. It is not in NATO's interest that
the Russian military liaison cell at Allied Command Operations' SHAPE
remains closed. [Third, [balancing deterrence and dialogue is essential
to sustaining political cohesion]{.mark} [among allies]{.mark} some of
[whom]{.mark} [have differing perspectives on the nature of the Russian
threat]{.mark} and the best responses to it.]{.underline}70 NATO should
not return to "business as usual" with Russia as before 2014, but
restricting dialogue is not an effective form of punishment. **[[In
periods of]{.mark} increased [tension, the risk of accident and
unintended consequences increases---dialogue can mitigate]{.mark} some
of [that risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In short, [sustaining and even
expanding dialogue with Russia is in NATO's interest. [Arms control
remains an important goal of]{.mark} real [dialogue with
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even [[during the]{.mark} height of the
[Cold War, U.S.-Russian agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
imperfect, [[reduced weapons stockpiles, improved stability and were the
basis of a degree of trust]{.mark}.]{.underline}71 [The [Russian
violation of the]{.mark}]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
([[INF]{.mark}) Treaty]{.underline} is a serious setback and
[[threatens]{.mark} the "fabric" of [arms control agreements
that]{.mark} have [contribute]{.mark}d [to security]{.mark}]{.underline}
for decades.72 First, the United States should not abrogate the Treaty,
as this step diverts attention from the Russian violation and is not
required by the United States to counter the Russian deployment. Even
now that the U.S. has begun the six-month process of withdrawing, [every
effort must be made]{.underline} to preserve the Treaty [using diplomacy
to hold Russia accountable and bring it back into
compliance]{.underline}. **[[The U.S. should]{.mark} continue to
[explore every diplomatic angle, while]{.mark} continuously [consulting
allies at every step]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, [the parties
should explore more fully reciprocal on-site inspections for
Russia]{.underline} at the NATO ballistic missile defense sites and for
the U.S. at Russian cruise missile sites.73 [[Such
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} would not be simple or quick, but
[[are worth the effort]{.mark} considering the severe impact of losing
the INF Treaty]{.underline}. Another potential diplomatic approach is to
begin discussions to broaden the Treaty to include China, which has INF
systems of concern to both Russia and the U.S. Especially with the
renewal of the New START Treaty in 2021, [[now is the time to]{.mark}
use every tool to preserve and even extend arms control
agreements]{.underline}. [NATO should stand united in [support]{.mark}
of [American diplomacy to sustain arms control with Russia]{.mark} by
exploring new measures [to prevent a renewed arms race that would be
destabilizing]{.mark} and expensive.]{.underline} [The alternative is
that in two years there may be no arms control treaties with Russia for
the first time in over 50 years.]{.underline}

Gates and Leon Panetta taught me that the U.S. role stretches far beyond
that. As the only NATO ally with a global posture and the capabilities
to match, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, for its part,
[must alert allies to new threats, push the alliance toward innovation,
and help maintain unity across the members**. When the United States
abdicates those other important leadership roles, NATO starts to
stall.**]{.underline} For Pompeo, [a more effective
approach]{.underline} than admonishment **[would be to issue a call for
a return to NATO solidarity]{.underline}**, **[which must always begin
with the United States]{.underline}**. Then, to showcase Washington's
commitment, Pompeo could announce that the State Department and Pentagon
officials who were tasked with calculating a bill for allies hosting
U.S. troops have been told to stop work. **[That would send a strong
message to NATO allies. Pompeo should also back off from Trump's
holier-than-thou approach]{.underline}** on defense modernization,
**[admit that waging future war will require new ways of thinking that
can't yet be found on either side of the Atlantic]{.underline}**, [and
remind allies that the best solutions]{.underline} to tomorrow's
challenges [start with everyone uniting over a **common
purpose.**]{.underline}

#### It\'s most strategic for European leaders to *[comply with all consultations]{.underline}* -- they're practically a *[rubber stamp]{.underline}* 

**Sloan,** Scholar in Political Science at Middlebury College,

WHILE PREPARING FOR A POST-TRUMP FUTURE,"
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/03/what-should-nato-allies-do-coping-with-trump-while-preparing-for-a-post-trump-future/)//EF>

Donald [Trump's ascent to the presidency on an "America First" platform
raised the prospect of the new president qualifying decades of U.S.
support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),]{.underline}
America's most important alliance. [While far-right
politicians]{.underline} across Europe [celebrated, British Prime
Minister Theresa May, **hoping to convince Trump to take a more positive
attitude** toward NATO, advised,]{.underline} "With the threats we face,
**[it's not the time for less cooperation]{.underline}**." As I wrote in
a 2017 essay for the International Security Studies Forum, candidate
Trump disparaged the transatlantic alliance throughout his campaign by
suggesting that the United States might not remain committed to
collective defense under Article 5, by calling NATO "obsolete" (though
he later walked that back), and by taking a generally transactional view
of the alliance that appeared to undermine the idea of collective
defense. Since taking office, Trump has not gone to those extremes,
though his campaign assertions, his insistence to Angela Merkel that
Germany still owed "vast sums of money" to the United States and the
alliance for its defense, and his seeming reluctance to condemn Russia's
Vladimir Putin have contributed to a persistent sense of unease about
the future of the transatlantic relationship. **[Now, the allies need to
develop a coherent strategy for coping with the demands and
unpredictability of the Trump administration and preparing for the
future revitalization of the transatlantic relationship.]{.underline}**
Fortunately[, both can be accomplished together.]{.underline} Moreover,
Europe has already started taking some of these actions. Europeans
should realize that America's commitment to transatlantic relations is
not based solely on the president's view. Despite Trump's dramatic
criticisms of the transatlantic relationship, both congressional and
public attitudes have remained highly supportive of NATO. While there is
certainly room for improving the systems underlying the transatlantic
relationship, the alliance remains a practical vehicle for shared
defense of interests as well as a key symbol of the Western values of
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. Illiberal tendencies
on both sides of the Atlantic have made it clear that those values are
being challenged. [Europe should therefore seek to mitigate the
short-term impact of Trump's disruptive views]{.underline} while
responding to legitimate American concerns and build a foundation for
the alliance's future. [That future will also depend on
whether]{.underline} the European [allies are successful in dealing
with]{.underline} the [challenges]{.underline} posed by domestic
illiberal political movements, like those that recently scored a big
electoral victory in Italy.

#### NATO and Trump have solidarity on *[arms controls policy]{.underline}*

Russia's Arms Treaty Violation," Foreign Policy,

[The Trump administration and NATO, which have been antagonists more
often than not, presented an **unusual united front on
Tuesday**]{.underline}, when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave
Russia a 60-day ultimatum to come back into compliance with a Cold
War-era arms treaty. After a meeting of senior U.S., Canadian, and
European diplomats at NATO in Brussels on Tuesday, [Pompeo accused
Russia of being in material breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, saying Washington would suspend obligation
to the agreement in 60 days if Moscow doesn't reverse
course.]{.underline} Almost immediately, **[NATO foreign ministers
released a joint statement supporting America's
accusations]{.underline}** and acknowledging that Russia was violating
the treaty, which prohibits the use of nuclear and conventional missiles
with ranges between 500 and 5,500 km (300 to 3,400 miles). In the case
of some of the foreign ministers, [the show of support for the U.S.
position may reflect a desire to fix rather than ditch the INF Treaty
altogether]{.underline}, as Trump has previously threatened to do. In a
statement that was uncharacteristically strong for the alliance, the
[ministers said the United States has remained in full compliance with
its INF Treaty obligations, pinning the responsibility for preserving
the arms control agreement squarely on Moscow's shoulders.]{.underline}
"We strongly support the finding of the United States that Russia is in
material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty," the statement
read. "We call on Russia to return urgently to full and verifiable
compliance. It is now up to Russia to preserve the INF Treaty." The
ministers pointed to Russia's development of the Novator 9M729
ground-based cruise missile, which violates the terms of the treaty and
poses "significant risks" to the security of the region. Questions over
the INF Treaty have been brewing for years, long predating the Trump
administration. "On at least 30 occasions since 2013, extending to the
highest levels of leadership, we have raised Russia's noncompliance and
stressed that a failure to return to compliance would have
consequences," Pompeo said in public remarks on Tuesday. "Russia's reply
has been consistent: deny any wrongdoing, demand more information, and
issue baseless counter-accusations." **[The NATO statement signaled a
rare showcase of solidarity between the United States and its allies
under a president who has regularly spurned NATO and left out allied
leaders from key deliberations on other issues]{.underline}**. "It's one
thing for the U.S. to come out and say it, but for NATO to say 'We 29
allies know Russia is in breach' is a strong, supportive agreement from
NATO," said Jim Townsend, the former top NATO policy official at the
U.S. Defense Department under former President Barack Obama. "It's
saying, **['We're now confronting this thing head-on
together.'"]{.underline}**

[NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNBC that President Donald
**Trump's rhetoric on defense spending is having an "important" impact
on the military alliance.** "I'm saying that his message has been very
clear and that **his message is having an impact on defense spending**.
And this is important because we need fairer burden sharing in the NATO
alliance,]{.underline}" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble at the Munich
Security Conference on Saturday. "We see more nations spending 2 percent
of GDP (gross domestic product) on defense which is the NATO guideline
and we see that all nations have stopped the cuts we saw for many years
to their defense budgets. And all nations have started to increase, " he
added**[. Contributions to NATO are a highly sensitive
topic.]{.underline}** [Trump has often criticized other NATO members for
not respecting the spending rule.]{.underline} Speaking at a NATO summit
in 2017, Trump said: "Over the last eight years, the United States spent
more on defense than all NATO countries combined. If all NATO members
had spent just 2 percent of GDP on defense last year, we would have had
another \$119 billion for our collective defense."

### AT: Trump Ruined NATO

#### NATO will only survive Trump through *[increased bilateral cooperation]{.underline}* -- the US can lead in the area of *[arms spending]{.underline}* 

**Chiampan,** PhD, **02-19** (Andrea, Postdoctorate Fellow at Swiss
National Science Foundation (SNSF), "Trump and the Future of NATO,"
Current Affairs in Perspective, p. 7)//EF

**[Still, [NATO will survive Trump---if anything because Trump does not
represent]{.mark} the [views of Congress and the US Military]{.mark}
Establishment]{.underline}**.[36 The foreign policy and military elites
are strongly committed to NATO and a change in leadership will most
likely reduce transatlantic tension.]{.underline} This is not to say,
however, that Europe should simply sit this presidency in and wait for
the storm to pass. Useful lessons about how NATO can survive Trump's
challenge can be learned from historical analogy. [NATO has undergone
numerous crises, but it survived each time---how? Certainly, during the
Cold War it survived because NATO was an essential part of US strategy
of Soviet containment, but **these [rifts were]{.mark} also [overcome
through small]{.mark} [compromise adjustments that increased trust,
cooperation, and reinforced deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[In
1967]{.mark}, for instance, [McNamara decided to create the Nuclear
Planning Group (NPG) to compensate for the failure of the MLF
and]{.mark} to [prevent]{.mark} the [spread of]{.mark} Gaullist [ideas
about the unreliability of]{.mark} the [US nuclear commitment]{.mark}.37
[It was a small step that]{.mark} however [carried important long-term
consequences as the NPG became one of the central poles of]{.mark}
decision-making in [the Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[NATO will
survive this crisis too]{.mark}, but it will also have to take small and
incremental steps in the right direction]{.underline}**. [For instance,
all NATO members and international security experts agree that Canada
and Europe should spend more on defense, but their focus on a fixed
increase in percentage of GDP is not what NATO needs**.
[Spending]{.mark} [should be based on real-world]{.mark} military
[requirement for defense]{.mark} and deterrence**.38 To this regard, the
relevance of the 2% mark is to say the least questionable.]{.underline}
[[NATO should]{.mark} also [reach a strategic agreement on what]{.mark}
these [military capabilities should be]{.mark}. It is true that
geopolitical instability is rising, great power rivalry might return as
a feature of international relations, and new challenges from non-state
actors and new technologies may continue to emerge]{.underline}. But at
present, NATO is performing only non-combat training missions in Iraq
and Afghanistan, a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and a policing
mission in the Mediterranean. It also holds a few maritime and air
standing forces, including the NATO Response Force (NRF). Most of NATO
members participate in and contribute to these missions at varying
degrees. It is also clear that the kind of capabilities necessary to
perform these roles are not the same needed to fight a war in Europe.
[**[It is understandably hard for European democracies to demand]{.mark}
[massive rearmament efforts]{.mark}** --- for instance Germany should
jump from \$40 to \$70 billion to meet the 2percent --- **[at a time of
relative peace]{.mark}**, even considering recent Russian
behavior.]{.underline}

#### Trump has *[reshaped norms]{.underline}* for the next *[generation]{.underline}* of American leaders 

**Peel**, Europe Correspondent for Financial Times; **Williams,**

<https://www.ft.com/content/9933782a-5465-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1)//EF>

[Some in Europe]{.underline} already [view Mr Trump's approach to the
relationship as part of a lasting change in the way Washington views the
world]{.underline}. European leaders see a great power competition amid
the growing US preoccupation with China and a belief that the US
military should deploy more sparingly and Europe should take on more
responsibility, albeit on Washington's terms. [The European anxiety
about the bond with the US has grown since Mr Trump took
office.]{.underline} Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and a frequent
target of the president, acknowledged last year that transatlantic ties
were "under strong pressure". During a visit to Washington last month
Florence Parly, France's defence minister, said Europeans feared the US
commitment to defend them was wavering and warned that other powers
including China were trying to split the continent. ["The transatlantic
relationship is changing: it's a transition that started before Trump's
**presidency and will continue after,"**]{.underline} says Sophia Besch,
a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. "His approach that
the US gains nothing from alliances is something that is specific to
him. **[But the shift of interest to Asia and a general reluctance to
get involved militarily because of the experience of forever wars has
shaped the thinking of the next generation of American
leaders."]{.underline}**

#### Trump's small concessions to NATO have been *[symbolically important]{.underline}* -- proves *[talks]{.underline}* are chipping away at -- but *[further action]{.underline}* is needed

**Keogh,** Economics & Business Editor at The Conversation, **17**
(Bryan, "When Trump met NATO: Blunt talk and meaningful silences,"
<https://theconversation.com/when-trump-met-nato-blunt-talk-and-meaningful-silences-78444)//EF>

[Donald [Trump's]{.mark} electoral [campaign was notable for]{.mark} his
[abrasive statements]{.mark} and blunt assessments [about]{.mark} a
variety of issues. Among his more unforgettable claims was his
suggestion that [NATO]{.mark} was "obsolete**." This comment was largely
founded, it seems, on a lack of understanding about what NATO does or
how it functions.**]{.underline} Since 1949, NATO has been a bedrock of
American foreign policy, first in Europe against the Soviet Union and
its allies, and then in Afghanistan. Trump's desire to build bridges
with the Russians, and his plain ignorance about NATO's contribution in
the war against the Taliban, largely explains his startling claim. But
what interests me as a keen observer of NATO politics is what Trump's
encounter with the other NATO leaders reveals about their relationship.
And what will he claim about that meeting on his return? [[As in]{.mark}
many [other policy areas,]{.mark} some quick [tutoring led Trump
to]{.mark} completely [reverse his position]{.mark}. Key to that
education was undoubtedly Defense Secretary James Mattis, who reportedly
told the German defense minister soon after Trump's inauguration that
NATO remained the "central pillar" of transatlantic security and
commented in congressional testimony that Russia remained America's
number one security threat.]{.underline} So [[Mattis]{.mark} himself,
Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson all
**[traveled to Europe]{.mark} in the first 100 days of the Trump
administration [to reassure NATO allies about the]{.mark}
[organization's continued importance]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This
sentiment was reinforced by General Curtis M. Scaparrotti, the current
supreme allied commander Europe. By April, Trump had issued a
predictably blunt edict in which he reversed course: "[[I said it was
obsolete. It is no longer obsolete.]{.mark}" [Still,]{.mark} for many of
us, [a subsequent visit]{.mark} to see those we'd publicly criticized
[would be awkward]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} just like his meeting with Pope
Francis, [Trump again]{.mark} [demonstrated]{.mark} an amazing [capacity
to shrug off]{.mark} his [earlier statements]{.mark} without any outward
sign of embarrassment -- while simultaneously asserting an authoritative
tone[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[The discussions in Brussels may have
been more symbolic than substantial.]{.underline}**]{.mark} But Trump's
ability to assume a claim of leadership -- and success -- was helped by
two developments.

#### NATO will survive Trump

Before Trump heads back to Europe, remember that NATO isn't the G-7 and
military relations are much stronger than the political ones they often
endure. Squee!! What is Trump going to say this time? That's how some of
the political press in DC sound already, both giddy and worried about
what President Donald Trump is going to say at the NATO Summit in two
weeks. More seriously, many Americans and Europeans [are
worried](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/world/europe/trump-nato-summit-g-7.html)
about what Trump is going to say and do in Brussels, and [how much
further](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/06/26/biden-european-leaders-reeling-from-trumps-hostile-behavior/?utm_term=.d20aca16fd79)
Trump may sink U.S. relations in general with European and North
American allies. You can't blame them. The G-7 meeting in Canada last
month was [a diplomatic
disaster](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/donald-trump-g7-chaos/index.html)
that left foreign policy pundit circles [aghast yet
again](https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2018/06/trump-goes-war-against-democracies/148875/)
at how the American president treated the leaders of his nation's
closest allies. (Trump supporters loved every minute of it.) Even before
that meeting, Foreign Policy had run an article headlined ["Can the
U.S.-Europe Alliance Survive
Trump?"](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/18/can-the-u-s-europe-alliance-survive-trump/)
(They were talking about Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran deal.)
After Vancouver, other headlines proclaimed U.S.-European relations at
an all-time low. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel
[said](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/trump-nato-germany/528429/)
Europe could no longer "completely rely" on American protection, leading
many to question the future of the alliance. There's only one problem,
or perhaps ray of hope. [Relations between G-7 leaders are not the same
as relations between their countries. And the G-7 is not
NATO]{.underline}. NATO is not political Twitter or a TV roundtable.
It's not an economic club. [NATO is a military alliance of treaty-bound
governments with troops trained to kill, fight, and die to protect one
another from foreign attack. NATO is a 70-year-old alliance that has
withstood political winds and Cold War nuclear showdowns.]{.underline}
It is a pact between democratic nations that their military men and
women will stand that post. It outlasted Kennedy and Kruschev, Brezhnev
and Reagan. It will outlast Trump and Putin and Merkel. [Military
relations are not like political ones]{.underline}. Take Turkey. Defense
One ran the headline "Are U.S.-Turkey Relations Fraying?" [five years
ago](https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2013/10/us-turkey-relationship-fraying/72446/).
They are. Last week, they were "[coming to a
boil](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/06/turkey-crisis-allies/149203/)."
But what is happening underneath? [Military leaders in constant contact,
still upholding their NATO pledge.]{.underline} Earlier this year, I was
talking with one senior military official who said he understood every
American concern about President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's confounding
moves in Syria and toward Russia, but he put it like this:
[military-to-military relations do and must operate on a level plane at
one level]{.underline} (as he steadily slid his hand flat in the air,
back and forth), [while political relations and the sometimes-heated
rhetoric of elected officials who come and go occur above
them]{.underline} (he raised his hand above his eyes, making the same
gesture). [It's true in many places]{.underline}. [If military relations
sour between the U.S. and China, it is potentially far more disastrous
than any downturn in the economic, political, or trade spheres. But even
when those relations are not so great, they're often
steady.]{.underline} In the early Obama years, when China froze
communications with the U.S. military, Pentagon leaders begged the PLA
to open up and talk, saying repeatedly that the U.S. wanted both sides
to "avoid miscalculations" [that could
escalate](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2014/05/hagel-asia-warns-china-back-down/85546/)
into war. China opened up, but they also proceeded with a rapid military
technological advance and created new islands to expand their power.
Military relations adjusted, but they continue. At press time, Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis is in Beijing discussing mutual issues like North
Korean denuclearization. Or take Israel. Conservatives, liberals, and
pro-Israeli and political pundits claimed U.S.-Israeli relations were at
an all-time low when Obama and Netanyahu weren't seeing eye-to-eye. But
at the same moment, military and intelligence leaders of both sides were
saying [times were never better at their
level](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2015/02/ignore-pundits-us-israeli-security-relations-are-stronger-ever/104724/);
as mutual trust, intelligence coordination, and arms sales were
flourishing. [The relationships of national leaders do not always
reflect the relationships of their peoples or militaries. So when you
hear predictions that in two weeks Trump [may pull the U.S. out of
NATO](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/06/26/biden-european-leaders-reeling-from-trumps-hostile-behavior/?utm_term=.cef15b5bd9b4),
take a breath and think through what it would really take for that to
happen. Think about the military.]{.underline} When Syria's Bashar
al-Assad was routing rebels and some U.S. leaders wanted Obama to
intervene with bombs and troops, there was one group left out of the
conversation who also had a vote: the military. At the time, Defense One
ran the headline ["Want Syria? Convince General
Dempsey."](https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2013/07/want-syria-convince-dempsey/67298/)
The point was that as right-left politics shouted at each other over
what to do, Obama's senior military advisor was sitting atop an officer
corps that was extremely wary of leading the U.S. into another unsure
military intervention in the Middle East just two years after pulling
out of Iraq. [Now think about the magnitude of a U.S. withdrawal from
NATO. Trump so far has deferred to the generals repeatedly --- on Syria,
on Afghanistan, on Guantanamo, on North Korea, and, yes, on NATO. Do you
really think Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford's "best military
advice" to the commander in chief at this moment in history would be to
pull out of NATO?]{.underline} Would any U.S. military leader's? Would
John Kelly's? Would Congress's? [Of course not.]{.underline} [We've been
through this
before.](https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2016/03/nato-joint-chiefs-chairman/127125/)
[Trump has been dangling NATO withdrawal]{.underline} (or cheap
disparagement) [before his isolationist-but-militaristic base since
early in his presidential campaign. And Trump may continue to dangle it
over Europeans, the way he dangles tweets and falsehoods to manipulate
his constituency, the media, and his opponents.]{.underline} We know
that game now. Some of the NATO leaders he is going to meet in July know
it more than most. They were the ones he humiliated at the G-7. The G-7
isn't NATO. [NATO will survive]{.underline} July.

[[NATO's role as a]{.mark} political [alliance is often]{.mark}
forgotten and arguably [underutilized.]{.mark} [Consultation is an
integral part of NATO's decisionmaking]{.mark} process [but **also a

Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, [members can bring any issue of
concern to]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [C]{.mark}ouncil
for discussion, [particularly those related to]{.mark} the [security of
member countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} The alliance has held a handful
of Article 4 consultations but can and should hold more by doing away
with the misperception that an Article 4 consultation is a stepping
stone to an Article 5 commitment. In this regard, NATO is well-suited to
host discussions on the emerging challenge presented by China. To be
clear, this would not be a discussion on military options. Rather,
members would share their experiences working with China, particularly
with regard to Chinese investments in critical infrastructure and
telecommunications[. [They could then discuss]{.mark} what [risk]{.mark}
such investments might pose to their national security, intelligence
sharing and political freedom of action[. Finally, they might try to
reach consensus]{.mark} on steps NATO, national governments, or other
multinational organization such as the Europe Union might take
[to]{.mark} deter malign behavior and [guard against]{.mark} any
security [risks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

member-[states provide]{.mark} sufficient [resources to deter or]{.mark}
if necessary [prevail against]{.mark} significant [threats such as
Russia]{.mark} now presents]{.underline}, [[as well
as]{.underline}]{.mark} to fulfill its [[other]{.mark} important
[missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} the member-[states]{.mark},
and [especially the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [fail this]{.mark}
test, [they will pros1vide]{.mark} [an opening for those who argue that
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates need not and [should not be]{.mark}

#### NATO is crucial to preserve long-term peace beyond just the North-Atlantic Region -- also keeps US military spending in check

**Burns**, former American NATO ambassador, September 5, **18**
(Nicholas, "Assessing the Value of the NATO Alliance,"
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/assessing-value-nato-alliance>)
DR

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States.  In my judgment, [[NATO continues to
be of vital importance to American security
interests]{.underline}]{.mark} in five principal ways. [First, [NATO is
at the core of]{.mark} one of the most significant foreign policy
accomplishments in American history]{.underline}---[the creation of a
[long-term peace in Europe following the]{.mark} close of the [Second
World War]{.mark}]{.underline}.  [[Because of NATO]{.mark} and the
emergence of the European Union, [Europe is united]{.mark} after
centuries of division and war.]{.underline}  [[NATO's]{.mark} military
[strength has been a]{.mark} major [reason for the absence of war
with]{.mark} the Soviet Union and [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} since
1949. A recent Atlantic Council study reminds that [[America spent 14.1
percent of]{.mark} its [GDP on defense during the First World War, 37.5
percent during the Second World War]{.mark} and 13.2 percent during the
Korean Conflict.  [We spend nothing close to those levels now]{.mark} in
large part [due to the]{.mark} great power [peace we have
enjoyed]{.mark} for over seventy years.  [NATO has been a major factor
in that peace]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [due to the expansion of NATO
and the European Union eastward after the fall of the Soviet Union,
millions of East Europeans now live in free, democratic
societies]{.underline}---a significant success for U.S. diplomacy.   

#### NATO is beneficial for every country in the alliance, successful response to the Soviet Union proves -- US commitment is key

**Department of Defense**, 4-3-**2019** (U.S. Department of Defense,
"Secretary General Touts NATO's Benefits at Joint Session of Congress"
<https://dod.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1805017/secretary-general-touts-natos-benefits-at-joint-session-of-congress/>)
DR

WASHINGTON \-- [The [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [T]{.mark}reaty
[O]{.mark}rganization [not only is the longest]{.mark}-lived [alliance
in history, but also]{.mark} is **[the most
successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg told a joint session of the U.S. Congress here today.
Stoltenberg, whose term as NATO's civilian leader was extended through
2022, marked 70 years of the defensive alliance. The Washington Treaty,
which established the alliance, was signed April 4, 1949. The 1secretary
general's most repeated message in his address was "It's good to have
friends." He was interrupted many times by applause from the members of
Congress, members of the Cabinet and members of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. He received many standing ovations during his speech. Stoltenberg
detailed the history of the alliance and the changes it has made to stay
strong and relevant for 70 years. [[The alliance was formed in response
to]{.mark} the [millions of deaths]{.mark} in two world wars
[and]{.mark} the [increasing danger the Soviet Union posed]{.mark} in
1949. [The]{.mark} 12 [nations that formed NATO did so]{.mark} "with a
clear purpose: [to preserve peace and]{.mark} to [safeguard
freedom]{.mark}, with an ironclad commitment by all members of the
alliance [\[and\] to protect each other]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said.
"They made a solemn promise: One for all, and all for one."
**Unprecedented Period of Peace** [And [it has worked.]{.mark} In 70
years, through the waxing and waning of Soviet might, [peace has been
preserved and freedom maintained]{.mark}, Stoltenberg said. "The [Cold
War ended without a shot being fired]{.mark} in Europe, [and we have
experienced]{.mark} an unprecedented period of
[peace]{.mark},"]{.underline} the secretary general added. And this is
in the best interests of all allies, on both sides of the Atlantic, he
said. ["[Ever since]{.mark} the founding of our alliance in
[1949]{.mark}, every Congress, every American president, your men and
women in uniform, and the people of the United States of America, have
been staunch supporters of NATO,"]{.underline} Stoltenberg said.
["**[America has been the backbone of our alliance.]{.mark}** It has
been fundamental to European security and for our freedom. [We would not
have the]{.mark} peaceful and [prosperous Europe we see today without
the]{.mark} sacrifice and commitment of the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} For your enduring support, I thank you all
today."

#### The NATO alliance is important to all countries -- studies show a consensus of both political parties

**Pew Research**, nonpartisan American fact tank and research center
based in Washington, D.C. April 2, **2019** (Pew Research Center, "Large
Majorities in Both Parties Say NATO Is Good for the U.S."
<https://www.people-press.org/2019/04/02/large-majorities-in-both-parties-say-nato-is-good-for-the-u-s/>)
DR

As the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) celebrates its
70^th^ anniversary this month, Americans overwhelmingly say being a
member of NATO is beneficial for the United States. Nearly
[[eight-in-ten Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} (77%) -- [including large
majorities [in both parties]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[say being a member
of NATO is good for the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. [[These numbers are]{.underline}]{.mark}
essentially [[unchanged from]{.mark} April [2016]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, the public is more divided about whether the NATO alliance is
more important to the United States or other NATO countries. [A
plurality [of the public]{.mark} ([42%]{.mark}) [says NATO]{.mark} is
about [as important to the U.S. as it is to other]{.mark} NATO
[countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} [About a third ([34%]{.mark}) [say the
alliance is more important to other]{.mark} NATO [countries]{.mark},
while just [15% say it is more important to the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} While they agree that NATO membership is good
for the U.S., [Republicans and Democrats differ over the alliance's
importance to its members. Nearly [half of Republicans]{.mark} and
Republican-leaning independents (47%) [say NATO is more important to
other]{.mark} NATO [countries]{.mark} than the U.S.; only [a quarter of
Democrats]{.mark} and Democratic leaners [say the
same]{.mark}.]{.underline} These views also are little changed since
2016, during the presidential campaign.

#### NATO distinguishes the US from other world powers -- alliance is key to dismantle international issues like climate change and pandemics

**Burns**, former American NATO ambassador, September 5, **18**
(Nicholas, "Assessing the Value of the NATO Alliance,"

Third, the [[NATO allies are]{.underline}]{.mark} among [[our
closest]{.mark} and most supportive [global partners as we
confront]{.mark}]{.underline} the great [[transnational
challenges]{.mark} that define this century]{.underline}---[the fight
against [terrorism]{.mark}, the entire complex of [cyber
threats]{.mark}, [climate change]{.mark}, the risk of
[pandemics]{.mark}, [mass migration and others]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The [NATO allies]{.mark} and our partners in the European Union [act
together]{.mark} with us [on these]{.mark} and other [issues]{.mark}. 
[This is of incalculable benefit to the U.S.]{.mark}  [Neither Russia
nor China have treaty allies]{.mark}.  NATO is a significant advantage
for the United States when it acts as a force multiplier for American
interests.]{.underline}

#### The RAP allows NATO to in deter conflict, protecting allies, and maintain democracy.

**NATO,** the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 6/20/**19**
(<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_133127.htm>)

[**NATO** is a political and military alliance, whose **principal task
is** to ensure the protection of its citizens and to promote security
and stability]{.underline} in the North Atlantic area. [The Alliance
must be able to address the full spectrum of current and future
challenges]{.underline} and threats from any direction, simultaneously.
[The Alliance has been strengthening its deterrence and
defense]{.underline} posture in light of the changed [and evolving
security environment]{.underline}. Collective defense remains the
Alliance's greatest responsibility and deterrence is a core element of
[NATO's overall strategy -- **preventing conflict and war**, protecting
Allies, maintaining freedom of decision and action]{.underline}, and
upholding the principles and values it stands for -- [individual
liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law]{.underline}.
[NATO's capacity to deter and defend is supported by an appropriate mix
of capabilities. Nuclear, conventional and missile defense capabilities
complement each other.]{.underline} NATO also maintains the freedom of
action and flexibility to respond to the full spectrum of challenges
with an appropriate and tailored approach, at the minimum level of
force. Russia has become more assertive with the illegal annexation of
Crimea in 2014 and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine, as well as
its military build-up close to NATO's borders. In parallel, to the
south, the security situation in the Middle East and Africa has
deteriorated due to a combination of factors that are causing loss of
life, fueling large-scale migration flows and inspiring terrorist
attacks in Allied countries and elsewhere. [The Readiness Action Plan
(RAP),]{.underline} launched at the Wales Summit in 2014[, was a major
driver for change in the Alliance's deterrence and defense
posture]{.underline}. [The RAP was initiated to ensure the Alliance is
ready to respond swiftly and firmly to new security
challenges]{.underline} from the east and from the south. Building on
the RAP, [NATO Heads of State and Government approved a strengthened
deterrence and defense posture at the Warsaw Summit]{.underline} in July
2016. It is [providing the Alliance with a broad range of options to be
able to respond to any threats]{.underline} from wherever they arise [to
protect Alliance territory]{.underline}, population, airspace and sea
lines of communication. For instance, four battlegroups were deployed in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, and measures have been taken to
reinforce security in the south-eastern region of the Alliance.
Furthermore, a number of measures have been undertaken to adapt the
Alliance to the challenges emanating from the south. NATO leaders
reiterated their resolve, at the 2018 Brussels Summit, by adopting a
Readiness Initiative to enhance the Alliance's rapid-response
capability, either for reinforcement of Allies in support of deterrence
or collective defense, including for high-intensity warfighting, or for
rapid military crisis intervention, if required. With the Readiness
Initiative or the so-called "four thirties", Allies committed to forming
-- by 2020 -- 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons and 30
battleships ready to use within 30 days or less. They will be able to
respond to threats coming from any direction and will further strengthen
NATO's deterrence and defense posture. [The adaptation of NATO's Command
Structure, coupled with logistical enablement of NATO European
territory, will help ensure NATO troops and equipment can deploy across
Europe without delay both for exercises and for reinforcements in an
emerging crisis]{.underline}. Moreover, the creation of a new Cyber
Operations Centre in Belgium and the formation of hybrid support teams
to assist Allies in need will also boost the Alliance's deterrence
efforts, especially since NATO has recognized "cyber" as a domain of
operations in which it must defend itself as it does in the air, on land
and at sea. The Alliance's actions are defensive in nature,
proportionate and in line with international commitments given the
threats in the changed and evolving security environment, and the
Alliance's right to self-defense. [NATO also remains fully committed to
non-proliferation, disarmament, arms control and confidence- and
security-building measures to increase security and reduce military
tensions.]{.underline} For instance, all NATO Allies are seriously
concerned by Russia's deployment of a nuclear-capable missile system,
which violates the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and
poses a significant risk to security. However, in response NATO Allies
do not intend to deploy new land-based nuclear missiles in Europe nor
enter into a new arms race. NATO will continue to maintain a credible
and effective deterrence and defense, while remaining committed to
effective arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. Exercises are
an integral part of NATO's deterrence and defense since military
training is an essential requirement to maintain the Alliance's
readiness levels and flexibility. Allies go beyond the letter of the
Vienna Document and other transparency measures in planning and
conducting NATO exercises. The Vienna Document is a politically binding
agreement, initiated by the Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe, which is designed to promote mutual trust and transparency
about a state's military forces and activities. More specifically,
NATO's strengthened deterrence and defense posture entails efforts in
areas such as conventional forces, forward presence, joint air power and
maritime forces, as well as cyber defense, civil preparedness and
countering hybrid threats, including in cooperation with the European
Union (EU). Reinforced relations with the EU include increased
cooperation, as well as complementary and interoperable capability
development to avoid duplication and contribute to transatlantic
burden-sharing. The Defence Investment Pledge, adopted by NATO leaders
in 2014, called for all Allies to stop cuts to defence budgets and meet
the NATO-agreed guideline of spending 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
on defense within a decade. Allies also agreed, in that same timeframe,
to move towards spending at least 20% of annual defence expenditure on
major new equipment, including related research and development.
Finally, the Pledge committed Allies to ensuring that their land, air
and maritime forces meet NATO-agreed guidelines for deplorability,
sustainability and other agreed metrics, and that their armed forces can
operate together effectively, including through the implementation of
NATO standards and doctrines. Since 2014, Allies have made considerable
progress in increasing defense spending and investing in major
equipment. Allies are not just delivering more of the heavier, high-end
capabilities NATO needs; they are also improving the readiness,
deplorability, sustainability and interoperability of their forces.

### !! -- Terror

#### NATO alliance is key to the economy and solve global security issues -- terrorism, climate change, and pandemics

**Burns**, former American NATO ambassador, July 11, **18** (Nicholas,
"What America Gets Out of NATO",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html>)
DR

None of this, of course, is likely to disturb [Mr. Trump, who remains
steadfast in his belief that]{.underline} whatever benefits the United
States gained from the trans-Atlantic alliance in the past, [the country
no longer profits. But he's wrong --- there are compelling reasons that
[NATO]{.mark} in particular [will be a distinct advantage for America's
security]{.mark} far into the future.]{.underline} First,
[[NATO's]{.mark} formidable conventional and nuclear [forces are the
most effective way to protect North America and
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the heart of the democratic world ---
[[from attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Threats]{.mark} to our collective
security [have not vanished]{.mark} in the 21st century. Mr. [Putin
remains]{.mark} a determined adversary [preying on]{.mark} Eastern
[Europe and]{.mark} American [elections]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO is
a]{.mark} force [multiplier]{.mark}: The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has allies who will stand by us]{.mark}]{.underline}, while Russia has
none. And while it's true that most of America's NATO allies need to
increase their defense spending under the treaty, they're not
freeloaders: [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [relied on
NATO]{.mark} allies [to strike]{.mark} back [against Al Qaeda]{.mark} in
Afghanistan and the Islamic State [in the Middle
East]{.mark}.]{.underline} European troops have replaced American
soldiers in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and contribute the large
majority in Kosovo. Our NATO allies are also getting better about
contributing their fair share. They have increased their defense
spending by a total of more than \$87 billion since Mr. Putin annexed
Crimea in 2014. Fourteen more allies will reach NATO's military spending
target --- 2 percent of gross domestic product --- by 2024. Mr. Trump
would be smart to claim credit for this at this week's summit. [[A
second reason]{.mark} for maintaining the trans-Atlantic alliance
[is]{.mark} America's [economic future]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
European Union is our country's largest trade partner, and its largest
investor. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} the
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [are the]{.mark} world's two [largest
economies]{.mark}, and can steer global trade to their advantage if they
stick together. More than [four million Americans work for European
companies in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. [Forty-five]{.mark} of
the 50 [states export more to Europe than to China]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Mr. Trump is right that the two sides are also economic competitors, and
trade disputes are inevitable. His predecessors kept this tension in
balance lest there be damaging consequences for American businesses,
workers and farmers --- a good reminder for Mr. Trump, whose
ill-conceived trade war with Canada and Europe risks harming the
American economy. Third, [[future]{.mark} American [leaders will
find]{.mark} [Europe is our most capable]{.mark} and willing [partner in
tackling]{.mark} the biggest [threats to]{.mark} global [security:
climate change; drug and cybercrime cartels; terrorism; pandemics and
mass migration from Africa and the Middle East.]{.mark}]{.underline} And
[America's NATO [allies will continue to be indispensable in]{.mark}
safeguarding [democracy]{.mark} and freedom, [under assault by Russia
and China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mr. [Trump's campaign to undermine the
European Union and diminish America's leadership in NATO serves none of
these interests]{.underline}. He seems driven by resentment about
European trade surpluses and low defense budgets, issues that blind him
to all the other benefits Americans derive from our alliance with Europe
and Canada. Mr. Trump may believe his blistering attacks on Europe's
trade policies and defense budgets are a good negotiating tactic before
the summit. But in fact they have already done enormous damage. While
**[he cannot]{.underline}** [outright]{.underline} **[kill
NATO]{.underline}** [--- the American public and Congress support it too
strongly]{.underline} --- he has eroded significant levels of trust and
good will. As it became clear during my recent visits across Europe, a
dangerous breach has opened in the trans-Atlantic alliance --- by far
the worst in seven decades. [Mr. Trump wants Americans to believe that
their allies are simply taking advantage of them. [On Sept. 11]{.mark},
2001]{.underline}, I witnessed a far different reality as American
ambassador to NATO. [[Canada and the European allies volunteered within
hours of the attacks to invoke Article 5 of]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} treaty, which compels all members to respond
to an attack on any single member, for the first time in history. [[They
came to our defense when we]{.mark} most [needed them]{.mark}. They sent
troops to fight with us in Afghanistan. They are still there with us 17
years later.]{.underline} Are we now going to throw off that mutual
protection, and go it alone in a dangerous 21st-century world? That
would be a historic mistake. But that is where we may find ourselves if
Mr. Trump's anti-Europe vendetta continues.

#### Escalation of terrorism has catastrophic impacts -- Armageddon kills hundreds of thousands

**Wright**, former senior editor at The Sciences and at The New

\(3\) Terrorism. Alas, the negative-feedback loop --- bad outcomes lead
to smart policies --- may not apply here. [[We reacted to 9/11
by]{.mark} freaking out and [invading]{.mark} one [too many
countries]{.mark}, [creating more terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[With]{.mark} the [ranks of terrorists growing]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[[amid]{.mark} evolving biotechnology and loose
[nukes]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[we could]{.mark} within a decade [see
terrorism]{.mark} on a scale [that would make us forget any restraint we
had]{.mark} learned [from the Iraq war]{.mark}'s outcome. If [3,000
deaths led to two wars, how many wars would 300,000 deaths
yield]{.mark}? And [how many new terrorists]{.mark}?]{.underline}
Terrorism alone won't wipe out humanity. But with our unwitting help, it
could strengthen other lethal forces. It could give weight to the
initially fanciful "clash of civilizations" thesis. Muslim states could
fall under the control of radicals and opt out of what might otherwise
have become a global civilization. [[Armed with
nukes]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pakistan already is), [[they would
revive]{.mark} the [nuclear Armageddon]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}. A
fissure between civilizations would also sabotage the solution of
environmental problems, and the ensuing eco-calamity could make people
on both sides of the fissure receptive to radical messages. The worse
things got, the worse they'd get. So while no one of the Big Three
doomsday dynamics is likely to bring the apocalypse, they could well
combine to form a positive-feedback loop, a k a the planetary death
spiral. And the catalyst would be terrorism, along with our mishandling
of it.

### !! -- Europe Falls Apart 

#### An abandoned NATO would be *[overwhelmed by burdens]{.underline}* and *[incredibly frail]{.underline}* -- destroys the western order 

**Rynning,** Professor of Political Science at the University of
Southern Denmark, **08-25-18** (Sten, "A EUROPEANIZED NATO? THE ALLIANCE
CONTEMPLATES THE TRUMP ERA AND BEYOND," War on The Rocks,

[**[NATO is unraveling and world crisis is upon us]{.mark},** writes
Robert Kagan in response to the 2018 NATO summit. [Kagan]{.mark} thus
starkly [depicts the worst-case scenario]{.mark} outlined in this essay.
[If]{.mark} [Trump embodies a fatigue]{.mark} in the U.S. political
system [with enduring alliances, an]{.mark}d if [Russia becomes a U.S.
partner of choice]{.mark} in tipping the scales of Eurasian land power
against China, [then **NATO**]{.mark} **as a transatlantic alliance
[would indeed unravel, and Europe's peace would be in
question]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** Still, even in this bleak scenario,
it is unlikely that NATO would go away. Rather, Britain is likely to
step in as continental Europe's offshore power, though, of course, with
diminished capabilities compared to those of the United States[. A
Europeanized NATO would tie Britain to the continent and perhaps become
part of the answer to the troubled British-E.U. relationship. The
European Union would not be able to stand still in the face of such a
security transformation. France and Germany would likely seek to rescue
their institutional project by accelerating the construction of a core
that would allow France to extend security guarantees to Germany in
return for French access to German financial governance, and which would
create an E.U. periphery, notably in Eastern Europe, alongside countries
such as Ukraine and Belarus. **[It is probable]{.mark} that [Western
Europe could rescue]{.mark} its [commitment to collective
institutions]{.mark}, including collective defense, [but it is
unlikely]{.mark} that [it could extend security]{.mark} guarantees [far
eastwards]{.mark}, as NATO today is able to**.]{.underline} **[[A
revised bargain]{.mark} [with Russia will then become necessary]{.mark},
[one in which]{.mark} the [sovereignty of Eastern European countries
will be questioned]{.mark}. Naturally, [this is not the]{.mark} current
[strategy of choice.]{.mark} Rather, [NATO diplomats are hoping to wait
out Trump]{.mark} while simultaneously acting to secure Europe's greater
input into, and say within, NATO]{.underline}**. The hope is that, by
Europeanizing NATO sufficiently, the allies can continue the
transatlantic bargain that contains the geopolitical impulses of the
European continent --- keeping Russia at bay and keeping Germany
embedded within a solid collective institution. [However, even [if Trump
were to go]{.mark}, such [a renewed bargain]{.mark} [raises difficult
questions of how Europe can **take on more burdens**]{.mark} **and gain
a greater voice in an alliance** to which the United States remains
committed. **[In this regard, Trump has]{.mark} done the allies the
service of [expos]{.mark}ing [the scope of NATO's geopolitical
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps enhanced political awareness
thereof will make the strategy of choice --- of continued transatlantic
cooperation --- more likely to endure, but there is no going back to
"your daddy's NATO," to paraphrase former NATO secretary-general Lord
George Robertson. [Geopolitical adjustment will take place. **[The
question is whether western leaders will remain in
control.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Spurs populism in Europe 

**Kaufmann,** Hertie School of Governance; **Laius,** Postdoctorate at
Otto Suhr Institute; **17** (Sonja, Mathis, "Ever closer or lost at sea?
Scenarios for the future of transatlantic relations,"
<https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328716303615)//EF>

[With populist nationalism on the rise on both sides of the Atlantic,
one could expect that governments focus on isolationism and, in the
European case, dismantling supranational structures. This is not
necessarily the case. Instead, they might find a common enemy to fight,
which could even lead to **unprecedented cooperation**.]{.underline} In
this scenario, populist leaders in the US and throughout Europe declare
a war against Islamic extremism, which they see as the central threat to
the West. Next to ideological motivations, this can be seen as strategic
behavior to gain support from constituents and to divert attention away
from economic hardships. [Donald Trump's victory was only the beginning
of a populist turn in world politics. Several European countries choose
or get very close to electing populist leaders. Even when mainstream
parties remain in power, this populist trend affects the political
discourse. Narratives of fear and xenophobia go hand in hand with the
discrimination of minorities.]{.underline} In Europe, Brexit leaves a
gap in terms of capacity and funding. Several other states with strong
populist movements discuss leaving the EU as well, hoping to get 'better
deals' or renegotiate parts of the EU institutional system[. The
uncertainty about how international trade will be affected leads to a
downturn of economic growth, especially in export-depending economies
like Germany. Following the populist logic of putting their own people
first, the US government establishes a modified version of the
isolationist Monroe doctrine and withdraws from combat zones. Others
follow this example, thus further destabilizing some world
regions.]{.underline} Ironically, this withdrawal − paired with inaction
regarding new conflicts elsewhere − leads to increased refugee streams
from the Middle East and Northern Africa. Transatlantic relations in
this period are largely limited to populist leaders assuring each other
and rejecting more interventionist or liberal positions. Following these
developments, central pillars of the EU − such as the single market,
open borders, the Dublin system on refugees, or the Euro currency − are
renegotiated or even abandoned. [Populists gain power in more countries
and decide to re-nationalize essential tasks such as border management
and foreign policy. Many member state delegates in Brussels no longer
seek to work on European integration, but rather want to keep suspicious
EU bodies in check. As a result, the institutional setup of the EU is
hollowed out and its collective action capacity sharply
diminished.]{.underline} In reaction to the reversal of European
integration in trade policy, the US reverts to bilateral agreements
favoring like-minded countries[. As the Europeans and the US
increasingly retreat from the international stage both militarily and
diplomatically, other states and regional blocs are stepping up.
Transatlantic relations are at a low point. Economically, populist
policies soon reach their limits, as bringing back jobs despite
technological changes proves impossible. Trade and investment flows
decline sharply due to protectionism and retaliatory sanctions from
other nations. At the same time, social tensions on the continent grow.
**Refugee camps become hotspots of crime and extremism -- ultimately
leading to a vicious cycle of violence and repression. In this heated
political climate, terrorist attacks in Europe then act as triggers to
further tighten security laws also in the United States.** Populist
leaders, particularly those with right-wing ideologies, are quick to
single out refugees and minorities as political scapegoats.]{.underline}
After several steps of escalation they finally decide to declare war on
their perceived enemies. A transatlantic coalition of the willing
invades one or multiple countries with a Muslim majority, wh**ic**h they
see as the origin of Islamist extremism and terrorism[. In the name of
defending the 'West' against Islamist threats, NATO or a different
military alliance is bolstered. Conveniently for populist leaders, such
military adventures abroad also help to bolster domestic support due to
a 'rally around the flag' effect (Lian & Oneal 1993).]{.underline}
Several indicators would point to the realization of this scenario.

#### Lack of American leadership in NATO collapses *[US hegemony and democracy,]{.underline}* while spurring an *[arms race]{.underline}*

What [Trump fails to understand]{.underline} is [that the disparity in
spending]{.underline}, with the U.S. paying more than its allies, [is
not a bug of the system. It is a feature. This is how the great postwar
statesmen designed it, and this]{.underline} immensely foresighted
[strategy has ensured the absence of great power conflict---and nuclear
war---for three-quarters of a century. The open, liberal world
order]{.underline} we know today [was built in the wake of World War II
and expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it is
led by the United States; **by design, it ensures permanent U.S.
military hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S.'
protection**]{.underline}**. [The goal of this American grand strategy
is to prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on
the United States and its allies. American hegemony serves, too, to
quell previously intractable regional rivalries, preventing further
world wars]{.underline}**. Dean Acheson, George Marshall and the other
great statesmen of their generation pursued this strategy because they
had learned, at unimaginable cost, that the eternal American fantasy of
forever being free of Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in
other words---was just that: a fantasy[.]{.underline} Four hundred
thousand American men lost their lives in the European theaters of the
First and Second World Wars. (American fatalities in all of the other
20th-century conflicts---including Vietnam, Korea and the Persian
Gulf---do not total one-quarter of that number.) [Our postwar
statesmen]{.underline} were neither weak nor incompetent. They [were the
architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S. history. So
successful was this policy that Americans now]{.underline}---most of
whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of these wars---[see peace,
unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's natural
state]{.underline}**. [This is an illusion. For centuries, Europe was
the fulcrum of global violence.]{.underline}** [With the age of global
exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of
violence]{.underline}, the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every
century with improvements in technology for violence. [The Scramble for
Africa, the]{.underline} division and [colonization of that continent by
Europe, is a case in point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa
Conference]{.underline}, which assembled the representatives of 13
European powers to settle their colonial claims to Africa by diplomacy
in place of arms, [did lead to peace in Europe for]{.underline} several
[years.]{.underline} Africans, however, would not recall these years for
their exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King
Léopold II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property.
[Ten million Congolese souls perished under his
ministrations]{.underline}. In recognizing this history of blood,
however, we must recognize something equally true: In the wake of World
War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest realization in the West. [This
flourishing of peace and human rights **cannot be explained by a sudden
outbreak of European pacifism**]{.underline}. (Consider the 1956 Suez
expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight Eisenhower; or the
1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because during World War II,
Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States overwhelmingly
powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union[. Through the
application of economic, diplomatic and military force majeure, **the
United States suppressed Europe's internal security
competition.**]{.underline} This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the
world's leading exporter of violence and became, instead, the world's
leading exporter of luxury sedans. [Only America,]{.underline} and
massive power as the U.S. exercised it, [could have
pacified]{.underline} and unified [Europe]{.underline} under its aegis.
[No other continental country possessed half the world's GDP. No other
country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted]{.underline}, to a
large extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies.
[No other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe
that its inhabitants could be persuaded]{.underline} gladly [to share**.
Indeed, Europeans cooperated with the U.S. program because it created
conditions under which both the United States and Europe flourished**.
The United States assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13
billion of aid in the form of the Marshall Plan.]{.underline} (In
today's dollars, roughly \$113 billion[.) It midwifed]{.underline} the
[groupings and treaties that would become the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion. [It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella
with the NATO treaty.]{.underline} Article V of the treaty, its most
important element, declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an
attack on all members. [These policies were intended]{.underline} not
only to counter the Soviet Union, [but to condition Europe's prosperity
upon its integration into a single market]{.underline}, with free
movement of goods, capital and labor. The founders of these institutions
fully intended them to be the foundations of a United States of Europe,
much like the United States of America. **[Profound economic
interdependence,]{.underline}** they believed, **[would make further
European wars impossible.]{.underline}** At the same time, the United
States built an open, global order upon an architecture of specific
institutions: the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and
the International Court of Justice. **[This order is in many respects an
empire---a Pax Americana---but it is more humane than any empire that
preceded it, with institutions that are intended to benefit all
parties.]{.underline}** Postwar U.S. statesmen believed that prosperous,
liberal democracies that traded freely with each other would neither go
to war with each other nor the United States. [They
ascribed]{.underline}, in other words, [to the so-called Democratic
Peace theory]{.underline}---**[a theory with overwhelming empirical
support.]{.underline}** The U.S. military was always an integral part of
the plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War
II, U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent
cannot be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its
resources and turning them against the U.S. The United States has built
overwhelmingly massive military assets there to deter local arms races
before they begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S.
protection that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their
safety is guaranteed. **[American grand strategy rests upon the
credibility of its promise to protect American allies; this credibility
rests, in turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its
commitment.]{.underline}** [(The Berlin Airlift, when U.S. troops
airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade, was precisely
such a display.) **In return for the United States'
commitment,**]{.underline} **U.S. [allies have accepted America's
dominant role in the international system]{.underline}**. In the postwar
era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought to undermine
the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because the Marshall Plan
would strengthen and unite the West under the United States' protection,
the Soviet Union's propaganda organs cranked into overdrive to denounce
it. A cartoon, for example, published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the
Marshall Plan's administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on
destroying the sovereignty of European nations. The French paper
L\'Humanité, which reliably parroted Moscow's line, wrote, "After
disorganizing the national economies of the countries which are under
the American yoke, American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate
the economy of these countries to their own interests." The Soviet
Union's criticism of the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in
Europe was eerily similar to the language Russia's now uses in its
campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of
Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by
far-right, far-left and other antiliberal politicians, parties and
movements throughout the West. With the men who built the postwar world
order now in their graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried
with them, a very sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that
their country built this system for a reason---that the United States
does not maintain its alliances as an act of foolish largesse. The
loudest exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the
European Union was "created to destroy us," and that multilateral
institutions such as the World Trade Organization assault the
"sovereignty" of the nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president
of the United States. It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless
these notions are. History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a
time, but reality is never so cooperative. [Global free trade sustains
modern economic life. An interruption to this trade---carried out
chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S.
military---**would bring modern life to an end**]{.underline}**.** The
Second World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism
were fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at
that**[. In the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel,
the internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles,
these fantasies are even more childish and dangerous.]{.underline}** The
U.S. may be on another continent, but it is not on another planet. It is
true that the U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and
as a percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part
of the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war
anywhere in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in
theory) fight multiple simultaneous major wars---even in space. Of
course this costs more. It is in America's advantage to be the only
power on the planet that can do this. Conversely, it is not remotely in
America's advantage for other countries to spend as much money on their
militaries as we do. Europe is America's biggest export market, as
designed. We want Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and
services, not razing Flanders to the ground yet again. Yet **[Trump's
refusal to deter our shared enemies and protect our allies risks
provoking a regional European arms race---exactly what the U.S. has
sought to avoid for 74 years.]{.underline}** It is an invitation to
adventurism from Putin. [**Trump's refusal to adopt the encouraging
language of past presidents**]{.underline} toward European integration,
language that until now [has been transformed into policy by
professional and experienced State Department employees**, puts further
strain on an already-weakened Europe**]{.underline}**.** Above all,
Trump's overt support for sordid, Kremlin-backed actors who seek to
undermine Europe's unity is unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's
interest, or in ours, for the American president to lend the United
States' prestige and support to Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal
Marxists, populists, authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists,
particularly since all of them are ideologically hostile to the United
States? [The damage Trump has deliberately inflicted on Europe's
stability comes at a uniquely dangerous time. Democracy's so-called
third wave---the global blossoming of open political systems after the
Cold War---has long since receded**. A threat to liberal democracy, in
the form of a distinct, rival ideology---illiberal democracy---is
ascendant.** We see it today in Russia and Turkey]{.underline}---a
corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and hollow form of democracy that
spreads and consolidates itself through the new technologies of the 21st
century. The global order the U.S. built was based on the principle that
only a world of liberal democracies can be peaceful and prosperous. That
principle is correct[. Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built
proceed at this pace, **the world will soon be neither peaceful nor
prosperous.**]{.underline} Nor will the effects be confined to regions
distant from the United States. **[America will feel them gradually, and
then, probably, overnight---in the form of a devastating, sudden
shock.]{.underline}**

#### Wrecks US hegemony -- removes *[network]{.underline}* of diplomatic and military capabilities and *[forecloses agenda-setting power]{.underline}* to new regional blocs

**Kaufmann,** Hertie School of Governance; **Laius,** Postdoctorate at
Otto Suhr Institute; **17** (Sonja, Mathis, "Ever closer or lost at sea?
Scenarios for the future of transatlantic relations,"

The decline of American hegemony has been proclaimed many times, but the
US has continued to be the sole superpower on the block. [Yet the 2016
election might go down in history as the turning point -- if the new
administration follows through with its plan to put 'America First' and
withdraws from international responsibilities. **This policy change puts
European collective action capacity to a test, leaving the EU to carry
on the torch of liberal values and democracy in the global world
order**.]{.underline} Following the Brexit shock, EU leaders agree on a
communications and legitimacy offensive to fend off populist movements
in the wake of Brexit. Europe's foreign policy apparatus evolves. As the
EEAS gains experience and fine-tunes its working relationship with
member states and the EU Commission, the changes intended by the Lisbon
treaty begin to materialize in practical terms. [The center of gravity
for day-to-day foreign policy moves to the European level, not least
because EU mxembers are happy to consolidate expensive foreign
operations. **At the same time, the United States decrease their
footprint in terms of both diplomatic and military capabilities
abroad.** US foreign policy focuses on core regions and tasks, which
means cutting back on large-scale diplomatic initiatives, early warning
and conflict resolution, or intelligence analysis]{.underline}. These
policy shifts draw heavy criticism from European allies and the
transatlantic relationship suffers − also because the new US
administration uses a different tone and style towards the old allies.
These organizational and strategic changes are reflected in policy
choices. [In United Nations negotiations on climate change, the EU is
the only actor that comes close to China's willingness and capacity for
leadership. Participants in transatlantic working groups discover that
their goals are not aligned.]{.underline} In addition, US negotiators
are much less enthusiastic about investing political capital and
resources in global governance. UN operational budgets across the board
are sharply reduced reflecting a reduction in US contributions that
cannot be compensated by others. Thus, while the UN remains a forum for
deliberation, its agencies lose practical relevance in global
governance. [At the same time, the member states of the European Union
come to terms with the fact that their transatlantic partner seems less
willing to assume a leadership role. A number of governments and the
foreign-policy institutions in Brussels take on more responsibility in
regional and global affairs. As a result, EU policymakers focus more
heavily on inter-regional cooperation with organizations from Africa,
Latin America and Asia. **A number of so-called 'intensive partnership'
treaties with regional blocs and individual emerging powers address
cross-border issues, such as migration and the fight against crime.** In
trade and investment, regional arrangements increasingly replace the
WTO, which is in hibernation due to the United States' refusal to
champion further trade liberalization on a global scale. NATO suffers
from funding cuts and is strictly limited to its core mandate for
territorial defense, while the UN Security Council drops from gridlock
to paralysis]{.underline}. Military interventions still take place --
but only based on ad-hoc coalitions. [For the EU this means creating a
more deeply integrated but still voluntary defense framework with a
focus on security in the near abroad and African countries of strategic
interest. A first indicator for this scenario is a shift in US foreign
policy from a global leadership role to a few selected initiatives.
**American agenda-setting power on the global stage is reduced as
foreign-policy priorities change, but also because European allies in
turn focus on other partners and opportunities**.]{.underline}
EU-internal changes in the institutional setup and practice of foreign
policy are another indicator to consider. The clearest sign of this
scenario, however, would be bolder and more controversial European
actions on the global arena -- both diplomatically and militarily.

[The fourth [major division within Europe is]{.mark} the **[rise of
nationalist, populist Europhobic parties across Europe]{.mark}**.
[Populism and demagoguery are]{.mark} [prevalent all across the Atlantic
alliance,]{.mark} [from]{.mark} Viktor [Orbán to]{.mark} Marine [Le
Pen.]{.mark}]{.underline} [At the moment, however, [the trend
appears]{.mark} to be [most]{.mark} [developed in Central
Europe,]{.mark} particularly Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary, [where
monoethnic societies have rejected]{.mark} EU [obligations to take
on]{.mark} a [share of the burden in the refugee crisis]{.mark}. But
[the rise of the]{.mark} Alternative [für Deutschland]{.mark}, the
[Front National in France]{.mark}, the [UK Independence]{.mark} [Party,
and other movements across Western Europe is just as
serious]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[NATO's strength comes]{.mark} not only
[from]{.mark} its military force but also its [common]{.mark} values and
[commitment to democracy]{.mark} and the rule of law.]{.underline}** The
rise of illiberal attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic is a
significant challenge for the Alliance's future. In the face of these
challenges to Europe, NATO and the European Union must seize on the
historic opportunity afforded by a likely Cyprus settlement later this
year to forge renewed political ties and practical cooperation between
the two organizations. [NATO and the EU have yet to figure out how to
use one military capability for two organizations. [This is foremost a
political]{.mark} [problem, not a military problem]{.mark}. Political
[obstacles to stronger NATO-EU cooperation result in duplication
of]{.mark} precious [defense resources]{.mark} and leave Europe less
safe and secure.]{.underline} The removal of the Cyprus problem as an
impediment to closer NATO-EU ties could create even more acute cultural
obstacles to cooperation. **[[Determined]{.mark} [leadership by
NATO]{.mark} and EU [leaders will be required to leverage]{.mark} the
historic opportunity of a prospective Cyprus settlement and, once and
for all, break through the bureaucratic obstacles to closer

International Security, "RESTORING THE POWER AND PURPOSE OF THE NATO
ALLIANCE")//EF

The breakdown of the security order in the Middle East is a second
strategic challenge for the Alliance. [The region faces a deadly mix of
a violent, unstable, turbulent future exacerbated by continued
destabilization from Iran and tensions with Saudi Arabia, declining US
engagement, the emergence of outside actors like Russia, and a
revolutionary age for Arab citizens.]{.underline} The Syrian civil war
has left the majority of its citizens homeless and the country
destroyed. Yet, the tragedy of Syria is no longer contained to the
region. [For five years, the United States and Europe sought to stay out
of the Syrian civil war, seeing insufficient interests at stake to risk
our involvement. **Yet, the West's inaction has proven to have its own
unintended consequences**]{.underline}. The abuses of the Assad regime
and the absence of power have resulted in vast crimes against humanity
and have enabled the rise of ISIS, the most violent and brutal terrorist
group on the planet today. [The power vacuum has also allowed Iran,
Hezbollah, and Russia to take a stronger military role in the Levant
through their support for Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime. The Syrian
crisis is not the only southern challenge facing the Alliance. Just four
years after NATO's UN-approved intervention, Libya remains a source of
instability and extremism as a result of its failed political
process.]{.underline} Yet, **[NATO and its partners who participated in
the UN-sanctioned Operation Unified Protector have a responsibility to
support the new government in its attempts to restore governance and
security to this strategically significant country.]{.underline}**
Neighboring Tunisia and Morocco remain the lone hopes for success from
the Arab Spring and worthy recipients of western support and assistance.
Iran, too, remains a military threat to the Alliance. After all, NATO
member Turkey borders Iran. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
between Iran.

[3D-printing]{.mark}; electronic [surveillance and attack

a]{.mark} clear [set of shared rules]{.mark}; [the genie of mass
surveillance]{.mark} -- to name just one example -- [is impossible to
put back into the bottle]{.mark}.]{.underline} Blindsided by the speed
and magnitude of technological change, politicians and bureaucrats are
slowly beginning to react to regulatory challenges. Technological
progress in key areas such as autonomous weaponry and GMOs is already
highly politicized. On both sides of the Atlantic, politicians attempt
to balance broad societal concerns with business interests. [Yet
[transatlantic leaders fail to]{.mark} jointly [address]{.mark} the
[implications of private-sector innovation]{.mark}, [let alone]{.mark}
make an effort to [coordinate research]{.mark} and development [in the
defense sector]{.mark}. Piecemeal solutions might allow politicians to
address voters' immediate concerns. In the long run, however, regulatory
differences create an uneven playing field, and the pressure keeps
mounting with every far-reaching innovation]{.underline}. In the United
States, the federal government takes a laissez-faire position on
private-sector innovation. Military research intensifies as Pentagon
officials draw positive conclusions from pilot programs with autonomous
drones and a toolkit to enhance offensive cyber capabilities. They are
reluctant to share advanced technology with NATO partners due to
concerns about Russian and Chinese spying. In Europe, by contrast,
high-level politicians increasingly point to risks associated with new
technologies[. [Opinion polls show]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [voters
are worried about]{.mark} health and [security questions related to
g]{.mark}enetically [m]{.mark}odified [o]{.mark}rganism[s and
a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence. [On the labor market,]{.mark}
advances in [robotics show their disruptive potential]{.mark}.
Genetically modified crops provided by an American conglomerate turn out
to have unintended side effects on the environment. EU officials also
voice concerns with regard to the privacy of European citizens, whose
[data is being mined and used for targeted]{.mark} political
[advertising]{.mark} on social media platforms [hosted in the US and the
UK.]{.mark} [An outbreak of]{.mark} avian [influenza in continental
Europe]{.mark}, meanwhile, [leads to a US ban on]{.mark} meat and
[livestock imports]{.mark} as well as quarantine rules for European
travelers from multiple countries. [In response to]{.mark} public
[concerns]{.mark} about these issues, [the]{.mark} high-level
[transatlantic technology council]{.mark} (TTC) [convenes for]{.mark}
its [inaugural meeting]{.mark}. Modeled after an earlier initiative on
economic cooperation, the body aims to enhance cooperation and trust by
changing the highly balkanized and inefficient landscape of technology
regulation.]{.underline} After long rounds of negotiations the experts
publish a non-binding whitepaper regarding nano-scale robotics in the
health sector. Military usage of these robots remains a possibility as a
European proposal for a moratorium is removed from the final communiqué
at the last minute. Another exception concerns ongoing US-Chinese joint
ventures, which are in conflict with EU medical ethics rules.
Participants are quick to call the TTC a political success, but in the
absence of concrete results the forum fails to become relevant**[. [As
EU and US negotiators are unable to overcome conflicts]{.mark}
[regarding]{.mark} broad societal values as well as [concrete technical
standards]{.mark}, [the future of transatlantic economic and security
cooperation looks doubtful]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Three sets of
indicators matter for this scenario. Observers should watch for the
framing of technology in political discourse: Future technology is bound
to be painted as a huge risk by some while others will warn against
over-regulation. This is linked to economic policy. Economies of scale
and winner-takes-it-all dynamics could tempt politicians to pursue
policies of economic nationalism, trying to prop up and protect national
champions. Lastly, the incidence of industrial espionage and mutual
mistrust will greatly influence the chances for meaningful transatlantic
cooperation.

#### A US-led NATO is key to deterring Russian tech

[As the United States looks to the future---whether dominated by
extremist groups co-opting advanced weapons in the world of globalized
non-state actors or states engaged in persistent regional conflicts in
areas of strategic interest---**new adversaries and new science and
technology will emerge**.]{.underline} Choices made today that affect
science and technology will impact how ably the United States can and
will respond. **[The changing strategic environment in which security
operations are planned and conducted impacts S&T policy choices made
today and affects how S&T may play a beneficial or deleterious role in
the future.]{.underline}** Some game-changing technologies have received
global attention, while others may be less well known; [these new
technologies and discoveries may significantly alter military
capabilities and may generate new threats against military and civilian
sectors. Future trend analysis is a tricky task.]{.underline} Colin Gray
said, "Trend spotting is easy. It is the guessing as to the probable
meaning and especially the consequences of trends that is the real
challenge."4 [How, when, where, and in what form the shifting nature of
technological progress may bring enhanced or entirely new capabilities,
many of which are no longer the exclusive domain of the United States,
is contested and requires better analytical tools to enable assessment.
Contemporary analyses of these emerging technologies often expose the
tenuous links or disconnections among the scientific and technical
realities and mainstream scholarship on national and international
security, especially with regard to the potential to have impact on
strategy and policy.]{.underline} The research underway is advancing the
strategic understanding of these game-changing technologies and the
development of meaningful and testable metrics and models to help reduce
that surprise. This paper, prepared for the Hoover Institution's
Governance in an Emerging New World project, [seeks to assess the
implications of new and emerging technologies for national security,
with specific emphasis on Russia, NATO, and the European
Theater.]{.underline} The paper begins with an introduction and overview
of what the authors consider the broader importance of the role of
technology as a factor (not \*the\* factor) of importance in national
security and military affairs. Next, the paper places itself in the
context of previous work on disruptive, emerging, and advanced
technologies and conflict, including the idea of revolutions in military
affairs. [That is followed by a discussion of Russian technology
development, including leveraging historical experience from the Cold
War and institutional politics.]{.underline} [This is critically
important in order to avoid **the trap of technological determinism,
i.e., assuming that a state will pursue something on technological
grounds only**. An analysis of the national security implications of
select emerging technologies---additive manufacturing (aka 3D printing),
machine learning and artificial intelligence, advanced stealth via
metamaterials, hypersonics, and directed energy
weapons---follows.]{.underline} A brief discussion of trends in U.S.
entrepreneurship follows. The paper closes with an analysis and
conclusions pertinent to the charge from the Governance in an Emerging
New World project's organizers, to assess implications of emerging
technology for U.S. national security with emphasis on NATO and Russia.

#### The biggest problem for tech is the widening *[transatlantic rift]{.underline}* 

Scott, Writer at Politico, 18 (Mark, "Forget 'techlash' --- The biggest
problem for tech is a widening transatlantic rift,"
<https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-us-tech-techclash-tax-competition-data-protection-vestager/)//EF>

But [below the surface of this so-called techlash by policymakers from
Brussels to Washington, the same divisions quickly reappear over how
Europe and the United States want to regulate Silicon Valley\'s biggest
names. For every antitrust charge or tax clawback]{.underline} that
policymakers in Brussels or other EU capitals demand from an Apple, Uber
or Twitter, [there\'s a stony silence --- or outright derision --- from
many of their counterparts in Washington, a lot of whom remain openly
skeptical that Europe\'s heavy-handed tactics]{.underline} are either
merited or can address the increasing concentration of digital power in
the hands of a few (mostly West Coast) tech moguls This transatlantic
digital rift is, if anything, widening**[. The inability for European
and U.S. officials to find common ground does not bode well for the
future of the internet.]{.underline}** [**Regional differences over
policing the internet are on the rise**. If two of the Western world\'s
largest digital markets can\'t agree on the norms underpinning the tech
world, **it will likely prove difficult to convince others** --- notably
fast-growing developing countries where people are just now coming
online --- to follow the lead of either Brussels or Washington, **and
not that of Beijing or Moscow and their more authoritarian approaches to
the world wide web**]{.underline}. It also will weaken the legitimate
--- and ever-expanding --- efforts to rein in the excesses of the
digital world if Facebook, Google and others continue to get mixed
messages from EU and U.S. officials about what is now expected of them.
Competition and data The friction between Europe and the U.S. boils down
to different takes on the central issues at the heart of global digital
regulation. On competition, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\'s antitrust
chief, and her national counterparts have been very clear. [From the
European Commission\'s €2.4 billion antitrust fine against Google (the
company is appealing) to Germany\'s charges that Facebook abused its
social networking might (it denies any wrongdoing), the region\'s
policymakers have made a direct link from these companies\' digital
dominance to significant harm to EU consumers, corporate rivals or even
our politics. U.S. officials are unconvinced.]{.underline} Speaking in
Washington last week, Makan Delrahim, who heads the Justice Department's
antitrust division, questioned the broad brush use of competition rules
to rejigger entire industries --- let alone relying on antitrust law to
police digital giants whose actions may (or may not) harm Western
democracies. [The same goes for how tech companies use reams of personal
data generated each day. With Europe\'s new privacy standards roughly a
month old, many of the Continent\'s policymakers are crowing about how
these rules have been adopted well beyond the EU\'s borders, helping to
reshape global data protection practices from Argentina to South
Korea.]{.underline} Wilbur Ross, the U.S. commerce secretary, has
criticized Europe\'s revamped rules \| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
That\'s not how many in Washington see it. [Wilbur Ross, the U.S.
commerce secretary, has criticized Europe\'s revamped rules, known
collectively as GDPR, **claiming they would harm transatlantic
cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to global
trade**]{.underline}. [American officials similarly balked at the extra
protections the EU demanded under the so-called Privacy Shield
agreement, which allowed companies to freely move information from
Europe to the U.S. \"Complying with GDPR will exact a significant
cost,\" Ross wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial
Times]{.underline}. \"GDPR creates serious, unclear legal obligations
for both private and public sector entities, including the U.S.
government.\" And don\'t forget tax Not to be outdone, tax ---
specifically Europe\'s plan to create new levies for digital companies
that generate billions from the region while employing few in the
28-member bloc --- is another bone of contention between two regions
that are bracing for a potential trade war. Faced with pressure from
France, the Commission recently proposed collecting up to €5 billion in
extra taxes from Apple and Google, among others, through a controversial
plan targeting revenues that online firms generate within the EU but
which currently escape the region\'s tax net. Valdis Dombrovskis, the
Commission\'s vice president, summed up the mood when he told reporters:
\"The amount of profits currently going untaxed is unacceptable.\"
Facebook, Google, Amazon and others take a global view. It\'s probably
about time policymakers start to do the same. In response, Steven
Mnuchin, the U.S. treasury secretary, chastised Europe\'s efforts to get
its hand on this pot of gold just as Silicon Valley giants repatriated,
collectively, hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas cash under the
U.S.\'s recent tax overhaul. "Imposing new and redundant tax burdens
would inhibit growth and ultimately harm workers and consumers,\"
Mnuchin said. [**For sure, much of these transatlantic tensions
surrounding tech are long-simmering**. But what has changed is the
(gradual) awakening --- among both policymakers and the general public
from London to Los Angeles --- that these digital giants, just like the
big banks before them, need a global set of rules that can be
universally applied, no matter where these companies operate. An EU-U.S.
consensus on what those rules should look like remains a distant hope
--- one complicated by vastly different views on the government\'s role
in tackling the industry.]{.underline}

#### Effective regulations are necessary to navigate the 21^st^ century threat landscape -- emerging technologies require *[specialized state responses]{.underline}*

DIRECT REGULATION: THE LEVIATHAN ORDERS YOU AROUND [The magnitude of the
problem posed by a world of many-to-many threats, when one faces it
squarely, is so overwhelming that it is tempting to simply ignore the
most direct and simple tool governments have in influencing their
citizens: the ability to compel people to do things and forbid them from
doing other things through what one might call direct
regulation]{.underline}. People tend to overlook direct regulation
because it seems like such a nineteenth- and twentieth-century approach
that is hopelessly inadequate to the challenge of terrifying new
twenty-first-century realities. But, although inadequate, it is
certainly not useless. And [**[direct regulation will continue to be an
important tool]{.mark} in the arsenal of governments**.]{.underline}
[The Leviathan may be weakened, but he is still a pretty fierce beast
when he breaches the surface with his teeth bared. These [fangs]{.mark}
[include the power not only to forbid and require conduct but also to
investigate conduct that might not comply with rules]{.mark}, to define
the conditions under which conduct is tolerated, to license people to
engage in certain behaviors, and to punish noncompliance with the
rules.]{.underline} These powers may be used in a heavy-handed or highly
calibrated fashion, or anywhere in between. They remain, and will
remain, among the most powerful ways of influencing the behaviors of
large numbers of people. [All sorts of direct regulations are already in
effect with respect to technologies of mass empowerment. [In the cyber
arena]{.mark}, for example, a great many [intrusions and online attacks
have long been subject to criminal prohibition]{.mark}. Prohibited
conduct that can land an individual in prison includes---to cite only
some of the major statutes discussed in the Department of Justice's
computer crimes prosecution manual---accessing a computer and obtaining
information without authorization, trespassing upon a government
computer, accessing a computer to defraud, malicious damaging of a
computer or information, trafficking in passwords, intercepting
communications, gaining unlawful access to stored communications, and
identity theft. [In robotics]{.mark}, on the civil side of things, [the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been engaged in extensive
rulemaking process to regulate the integration of unmanned aerial
systems]{.mark} into the domestic airspace of the United
States.]{.underline} These rules will cover who is permitted to fly what
sorts of drones, for what purposes, and under what circumstances. [[In
the biological arena]{.mark}, to note an example in which criminal
penalties back up civil regulation, the law requires people who want to
work with "select agents"---particularly dangerous toxins, bacteria, and
viruses---to submit to an FBI "security risk assessment," and it imposes
criminal liability both for possession of select agents by those not
registered to have them and for transferring select agents to
unregistered persons. [The law also slaps strict controls on the export
of technologies with military application or of a dual-use
nature]{.mark}.]{.underline} These are only some of a wide array of
legal controls on individuals in their handling, acquisition, transfer,
and use of technologies of mass empowerment. We mention these examples
merely to emphasize that [if government wants to prevent certain
dangerous or malicious behaviors, telling people they cannot engage in
them---and creating legal consequences if they do---is one place to
start.]{.underline} 2 [The promise of direct regulation is twofold.
First, **[criminal and civil regulations can establish strong behavioral
norms]{.mark}---far stronger than government's power actually to enforce
those norms**. Consider a radically empowering twentieth-century
technology, the automobile, which put in individual hands the power to
travel quickly between cities and also to kill pedestrians and crash
into other vehicles at high speeds. A series of direct regulations
governs our use of motor vehicles.]{.underline} You need a state-issued
license to operate a car, a norm that is widely respected even though
nobody checks your license before you get into your vehicle. Most
drivers, most of the time, display a sufficiently rudimentary respect
for traffic laws that the roads are relatively safe (though far less so
than are the airways or the railways)---even though drivers also know
that they are likely to get away with any number of violations. People
tend to drive inspected and registered vehicles with insurance, as
required---though they could almost certainly get away with driving
without either on any given day. And they drive cars with license
plates; every car is registered in a visible sense to its owner. [The
system of direct regulation of our use of this technology works because
of a combination of self-interest (people do not want to hurt themselves
or their vehicles or to harm others), social pressures from other
drivers, occasional random enforcement---the cop with the speed gun or
the officer who happens to see you run a red light---and the threat of
enforcement if you get into an accident]{.underline}. The result is that
laws that are unenforceable if widely ignored receive enough respect
that the platform they are designed to secure operates in a relatively
orderly fashion. Even with tens of millions of people using a lethal
technology on a daily basis, direct regulation wields a sufficient
influence on mass behavior that people---amazingly, really---retain
confidence in a platform on which relatively untrained people are
operating high-powered and very dangerous equipment at high speeds.
While some of this influence flows from the threat of enforcement and
the fact that compliance with the law here tends to correspond with safe
(and thus self-interested) behavior on the part of the driver, some of
it also simply reflects the power of law itself. In rule-of-law
societies, at least, the law carries some moral force, and people tend
to default in the direction of compliance. [Second, **[direct
regulations create the]{.mark} legal [basis for]{.mark} investigation
and enforcement [action that can play an important role in deterring
abuse of]{.mark} highly [empowering technologies,]{.mark} stopping and
[incapacitating those who misuse them, and letting]{.mark} potential
[bad actors know that authorities are watching]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
While enforcement by no means keeps pace with cybercrime, for instance,
direct regulations allow federal authorities to initiate a lot of
computer crime prosecutions every year. In fiscal year 2012 alone, for
example, the Justice Department reports that federal prosecutors filed
169 computer fraud cases against 266 defendants, 401 identity theft
cases against 567 defendants, and any number of other cases that may
have had a hacking dimension. The public knows about Luis Mijangos, the
sextortion hacker we discussed earlier, because of such federal
enforcement. And it is notable that Mijangos today is not free to
exploit other women and girls online; as of this writing, he is inmate
number 59209-112 in the federal prison system, serving his sentence at
the federal correctional facility in Greenville, Illinois. 3 [Direct
regulation plays a similar role with other highly empowering
technologies. Back in 2002, a scientist at Texas Tech named Thomas
Butler reported that samples of bubonic plague had gone missing from his
lab. The FBI descended in force on the campus to investigate, suspecting
a bioterrorism incident. When it later turned out that the samples had
not been stolen and that Butler may have destroyed them himself, the
bureau turned its sights on him. It also turned out, as the
investigation progressed, that Butler had mishandled plague samples and
exported them illegally. The Justice Department prosecuted him for
mishandling the highly dangerous agent, for allegedly lying about it to
investigators, and for financial irregularities with respect to his
university.]{.underline} Butler became a cause célèbre among many
scientists, who saw his case as one of gross government overreaching
against a distinguished scientist who was certainly no kind of
terrorist. For present purposes, however, the point is that [having a
complex set of civil and criminal regulations governing the handling of
biological materials provided a hook on which investigators could hang
an investigation of someone they clearly regarded as a
malicious]{.underline} actor. A jury ultimately convicted Butler on some
charges but acquitted him on others; he served a two-year prison
sentence. 4 [In the world of many-to-many threats and defenses, the
power of direct regulation will continue to serve as a frontline lever
for deterring, punishing, and smoking out abuses]{.underline}--- and
policy makers should not underestimate it. [As technologies become more
powerful and ever more widely available, we need to be imaginative about
the ways people might use them maliciously or recklessly and how their
routine uses might create opportunities for others to behave abusively
or recklessly. We also need to create the kinds of working regulatory
schemes that, as with automobiles, allow huge numbers of people to wield
lethal power in relative safety]{.underline}. The good news here is that
we already do this instinctively. As the technologies associated with
flying robots become more widely available, we have a regulatory process
associated with integrating drones into the national airspace. As we
have seen, regulations and criminal laws have developed around cyber-
and biotechnology as those platforms have emerged as potential
facilitators of deadly acts. [[The trick]{.mark} here [is to regulate
well, mindfully of the realistic benefits of new rules, of their costs
for innovation and benign use, and of their likely
effectiveness]{.mark}. Debates over the desirability and efficacy of
regulation are endemic in almost every regulatory sphere, from
environmental protection to gun control, and that will be no less true
here. We must also consider the possible costs of regulation for those
working to prevent bad acts; rules encumbering access to select
biological agents, for example, make it harder to do defensive
research.]{.underline} Of course, no regulation will deter the truly
evil, motivated person, whether her weapon of choice is an AR-47 rifle,
a miniaturized drone, or fleas carrying the bubonic plague. Moreover, at
least two features of technologies of mass empowerment make them a
greater challenge for regulation than the threats posed by most other
technologies. First, unlike automobiles---for which a certain number of
accidents, drunk drivers, and even malicious murders presents a socially
tolerable cost---[true technologies of mass empowerment potentially
involve actions that, even in very small numbers, do not present a
tolerable cost. A single major biosecurity event could kill thousands if
not millions of people.]{.underline} This feature makes regulation to
prevent such actions more urgent. In addition, however, because
technologies of mass empowerment transcend national boundaries in ways
that the threats posed by conventional technologies generally do not, it
is just impossible to guard against all potential threats posed by
technologically empowered people around the globe. Just as it may help
to think of national security as coming to resemble health and safety
regulation, as we described earlier, this aspect of the problem bears a
certain similarity to climate change in that it requires coordinated
international action from major countries worldwide to be truly
effective. Even if the United States were to get its carbon emissions
under control, China and India would need to as well for emissions
globally to diminish, and even if the United States were to adopt
optimal security policies, other countries still might tolerate behavior
that menaces Americans both abroad and at home. This globalized feature
of the threat makes domestic regulation, however urgent, simultaneously
less effective.

Place the lessons of all these changed scenarios alongside one another:
• [[Modern technology enables individuals to wield the destructive power
of states]{.mark}. • [Individuals]{.mark}, including you personally,
[can]{.mark} potentially [be attacked with impunity from
anywhere]{.mark} in the world. • Technology makes less relevant many of
the traditional concepts around which our laws and political
organization for security have evolved. National borders, jurisdictional
boundaries, citizenship, and the distinctions between national and
international, between act of war and crime, and between state and
private action all offer divides less sharp than they used to. • Our
nation---and [every nation---can face attack through channels controlled
and operated]{.mark} not by governments but [by the private sector and
by means against which governments lack the ability]{.mark} to defend,
making private actors pivotal to defense.]{.underline} Strung together,
[these lessons succinctly describe the security future with which
citizens and governments must now grapple. Much of what we think we know
about privacy, liberty, security, and threat is no longer true. Much of
what we have been taught about what threatens us, about what protects
us, and about the risks and benefits of state power versus individual
empowerment is obsolete.]{.underline} In the conventional understanding,
international security is a state-to-state affair; the relationships
between privacy, liberty, and domestic order are matters between
individuals and their governments; and civilian technologies in the
hands of individuals have relatively little to do with the way we order
either governance at home or international security. We built the state
to mediate disputes among citizens and to protect them from outside
attack. We gave it power to contend with other states and to ensure it
could govern effectively. Because we feared that power, we imposed
constraints on it. And we imagined its power and the security it was
meant to provide as being in tension with the liberty we expected it to
respect. We built walls around our countries with legal concepts such as
jurisdiction. And for the most part, these intellectual, conceptual, and
legal constructions have held up pretty well. Yes, we had to adjust in
response to AlQaeda and other transnational nonstate actors. And yes,
globalization has complicated the discussion. But [the way we think
about security---what it means, where it comes from, what threatens it,
what protects it, and the relationship between individual and collective
societal security---has remained remarkably stable]{.underline}. In what
follows, we mean to persuade you that [this way of thinking is now out
of date]{.underline}. Indeed, we argue that our debate about the fabric
of security and its governance is based on dated assumptions about a
technological world that no longer exists. [In our new world, you can
pose a threat to the security of every state and person on the
planet---and each can also threaten you. In our new world, individuals,
companies, and small groups have remarkable capabilities either to
protect others or to make them more vulnerable. In our new world, not
only do privacy and security not generally conflict, but they are often
largely the same thing.]{.underline} And in our new world, [[state power
represents a critical line of defense]{.mark} for individual freedom and
privacy, even as the state itself may be losing its ability to serve its
purpose as the ultimate guarantor of security to its
citizens]{.underline}. Driving this new environment is a mix of
technological developments. There is the radical proliferation of both
data about individuals and technologies of mass empowerment available to
individuals. Notwithstanding Edward Snowden's spectacular revelations
about the National Security Agency (NSA), [[the state's comparative
advantage in collecting data, manipulating it, and exposing individuals
to risks or protecting them from threats is]{.mark} actually
[eroding]{.mark}, as ever bigger companies occupying ever more powerful
market positions take on data collection and analytics as their business
cores. The miniaturization and automation of weapons further weakens
national boundaries---as well as the front door to your house---as
effective lines of defense. [Biological research and biotechnology are
progressing at an unprecedented pace, bringing]{.mark} great
promise---and [great danger---to human security]{.mark} all around the
globe. Our new environment of highly distributed threats and defenses
has already changed our lives, and it will change them more in the years
to come. It will change our sense of privacy, of safety, and of danger.
It will change our relationships with corporations, governments, and
individuals whom we have never met. It will change the way we govern our
collective security and how we manage our personal safety. And it may
lead us to ask questions about how we organize ourselves politically at
the local, national, and international levels]{.underline}. Today, each
person needs to fear an exponentially higher number of people and
entities than only a decade ago. The threats to your personal security
now include not merely governments and corporations but also other
individuals around the world: stalkers, identity thieves, scammers,
spammers, frauds, competitors, and rivals---everyone and everything from
the government of China to the NSA to Luis Mijangos. You can be attacked
from anywhere---and by nearly anyone. And so can countries. All
countries now face a similar array of threats---a much vaster array than
in only the very recent past. The inevitable greater reliance by the
modern state on computerized systems for all important societal
functions---ranging from national defense to electricity delivery and
water distribution to transportation, banking, and just about everything
else---makes the state and its inhabitants increasingly vulnerable to
exploitation and attack. Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks can more broadly
disseminate closely held government information, which is also far
easier to steal; a much wider range of actors can hack into networked
systems and exploit or damage the information they contain or the
functions they control. This point is not simply about cybersecurity.
[[Technologies]{.mark} [that put destructive power]{.mark} traditionally
confined to states [in the hands of small groups]{.mark} and individuals
[have proliferated remarkably far]{.mark}, as a general matter. That
[proliferation is accelerating at an awe-inspiring clip across a number
of technological platforms---in particular, networked computers and
biotechnology and, in the not-too-distant future, robotics and
nanotechnology as wel]{.mark}l]{.underline}. The [technologies in
question, unlike the technologies associated with nuclear warfare, were
developed not in a classified setting but in the public domain. And they
are not simple technologies either. [They are platform
technologies]{.mark}---that is, technologies [that facilitate generative
creativity in their users to build and invent new things]{.mark}, new
weapons, and new modes of attack. As these technologies become cheaper,
more and more people have the ability to give expression to what resides
in their hearts in the digital world, in the physical world, and in the
microscopic coding of life itself]{.underline}. [[And as these
technologies get cheaper, we become,]{.mark} as a global community, ever
more [dependent]{.mark} on them for our health, agriculture,
communications, jobs, economic growth and development, and even our
culture. These [dependencies make states enormously vulnerable]{.mark}.
Just as you are more vulnerable today to attacks from an ever widening
array of actors, so are the United States and every other country in the
world]{.underline}. Whereas once only rival states could contemplate
killing huge numbers of civilians with a drug-resistant illness or
taking down another country's power grids, now governments must
contemplate the possibility of ever smaller groupings of people
undertaking what are traditionally understood as acts of war. [The past
few decades have seen an augmenting ability among relatively small,
nonstate groups to wage asymmetric conflicts against even powerful
states. The groups in question have been growing smaller, more diffuse,
and more loosely knit, and technology is both facilitating that
development and increasing these groups' ultimate lethality. The trend
seems likely to continue and probably even to accelerate. It ultimately
threatens to give every individual with a modest education and a certain
level of technical proficiency the power to wreak potentially
catastrophic damage.]{.underline} As a thought experiment, imagine a
world composed of billions of people walking around with nuclear weapons
in their pockets. This problem is not entirely new---at least not
conceptually. The mad scientist mwuhhuh-huhing to himself as he swirls a
flask and promises, "Then I shall destroy the world!!" is the stuff of
old movies and cartoons. In literature, versions of the scientist
creating disaster date back at least to Mary Shelley in the early
nineteenth century. In some sense, it just reflects the old literary
fear of people playing gods---Daedalus and Icarus and the Tower of
Babel---recast for a more modern, scientific world. Along with literary
works set in technologically sophisticated dystopias, the character of
the technologically empowered madman represents one of the ways in which
our society expresses its fears of rapidly evolving technology. The
fantasy's sudden plausibility, however, is new. [Across a variety of
technological platforms, individuals and small groups are now playing
enhanced roles in the affairs of countries and regions---and those roles
will only grow more strategically significant as technologies of mass
empowerment develop further and penetrate more deeply. At the same time,
the very forces that are causing threats to multiply are also
distributing defensive capacity and responsibility.]{.underline} Only
recently, governments alone bore responsibility for protecting nations.
[Today it is possible to attack a country without ever confronting a
government-owned or government-controlled facility]{.underline}. The
data pipes into the United States, for example, are largely in private
hands---so that the government no longer controls the very channels
through which this country might face attack. [This means that private
actors---and not just BP---are uniquely positioned to defend against
attacks and that private actors must now bear responsibility for some
aspects of security. The more technology proliferates, the less
exclusive the government's security capabilities ---and therefore its
security responsibilities---become]{.underline}. Our new world, in
short, is one of many-to-many threats and many-to-many defenses. While
it is not yet literally the case, [every individual, every group, every
company, and every state will soon have the potential to threaten the
security of---and have his, her, or its security threatened by---every
other individual, group, company, and state]{.underline}. We are thus in
a moment unlike any other in the history of the world, one in which
distance does not protect you and in which you are at once a figure of
great power and great vulnerability. It is a moment that challenges
cherished ideas at the core of our political identities, that requires
us to face new realities at once exciting and terrifying. The world of
many-tomany threats and defenses is radically populist, a place in which
the relative power of the state to that of the citizenry is reduced and
in which we are unleashing the enormous creative potential associated
with giving people the power to do great things. It threatens, however,
to be Hobbesian as well---an environment of unaccountable freedom to do
great harm, in which the very lack of accountability for the harms we do
may spur some of us to do them. And it raises a giant question of
governance: How does a state provide for its security in such a world?
How does it organize its relationship with both the individual subject
to its jurisdiction and the individual beyond its jurisdiction who
nonetheless threatens its citizens or, indeed, the state itself? And how
does a state negotiate its relationship with other states, all with
equal claim to independence and sovereignty, as well as with those other
states' citizens? We mean to address these questions in this book. A
CENTURY AGO, IN 1914, in the wake of the assassination of
Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand, foreign affairs writer F.
Cunliffe-Owen looked for the bright side. While "it is only natural that
one should be stricken with horror at the brutal and shocking
assassination," he wrote in the New York Sun, "it is impossible to deny
that \[the archduke's\] disappearance from the scene is calculated to
diminish the tenseness of the \[general European\] situation and to make
peace both within and without the dual Empire." The archduke was so
universally regarded as a "disturbing factor and as committed to
forceful and aggressive policies, that the news of his death is almost
calculated to create a feeling of universal relief." 8 For anyone
presuming to speculate about the future of global security, this article
by poor Cunliffe-Owen---and the many hundreds of others like it that,
across time and subject matter, have gotten big questions spectacularly
wrong---is a cautionary tale with a loud moral: predicting the future
offers many more opportunities to look stupid than to look prescient.
Even with a horizon of just a few weeks, Cunliffe-Owen managed to
misinterpret the triggering event for World War I as one of those
moments of sudden relaxation that lets us all breathe a little easier.
He was not an idiot; he appears to have been a well-respected foreign
policy analyst. And he was not the only one. In 1913, David Starr
Jordan, then president of Stanford University, scoffed, "What shall we
say of the Great War of Europe, ever threatening, ever impending, and
which never comes? We shall say that it never will come." If people like
these could fail to anticipate the coming few months within 180 degrees
of accuracy, one should probably approach anticipating the broad
security trends of the coming decades with a certain humility. 9 So let
us start by making clear that our aim in these pages is not to sound the
alarm about inevitable catastrophic attacks using advanced technologies.
Such events, to be sure, may well happen; indeed, they may prove a
recurrent feature of the world we describe. But many people have long
predicted the proliferation of catastrophic terrorist attacks employing
widely available variations of weapons of mass destruction and harming
thousands or millions of people---and thankfully, these attacks have not
yet happened. We are not synthetic biologists, computer scientists, or
robotics engineers, and we are not aiming to assess the inevitability or
likely frequency of malicious exploitations of modern technology. [Our
concern]{.underline}, rather, [is the general problem of how to govern
so as to effectively ensure security in an environment of simultaneous
individual empowerment and individual vulnerability]{.underline}. As
such, we advance a single very general prediction: that [modern society
has not yet exhausted the implications for security and liberty of the
dissemination around the world of technologies that empower individuals
and of information about individuals]{.underline}. We believe both that
[this proliferation trend will continue to accelerate across a growing
number of technological platforms and that it will do so in a fashion
that will further complicate the task of governance in the interests of
security]{.underline}. As it does so, [it will profoundly challenge the
manner in which we currently think about issues of surveillance, civil
liberties, security, threat, and governmental responsibility, power, and
accountability]{.underline}. It follows necessarily that a great deal of
the United States' current discussion of the laws and policies that
govern privacy, liberty, security, and safety both within our shores and
across borders is out of date---or fast becoming so. And perhaps more
importantly--- and more tectonically---it follows as well that the
liberal political theory that gave rise to our vision of the role of the
state in providing security requires reconsideration, if only to ensure
that the state can meet the challenges of our new technological
environment. An enormous literature has developed in the post-9/11 world
on the effects of the rising power of nonstate actors on traditional
dichotomies in our law and governance: between the public and the
private, between war and crime, and between the domestic and the
international. Much of this literature has emphasized the role of
technology in the breakdown of these dichotomies. As the President's
Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies wrote in
2013 in response to the Snowden controversies, "The traditional
distinction between foreign and domestic has become less clear. The
distinction between military and civilian has also become less clear,
now that the same communications devices, software, and networks are
used both in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan and in the rest of
the world. Similarly, the distinction between war and non-war is less
clear, as the United States stays vigilant against daily cyber security
attacks as well as other threats from abroad." 10 Some of this
literature, particularly the work of Philip Bobbitt, author of two major
works on the history of warfare, and John Robb, a theoretician of
asymmetric conflict, has taken on directly the challenge to the modern
state that our new security environment poses. We draw on all of these
prior insights but add what we think are a few important twists. 11 For
starters, we are not narrowly concerned with the admittedly serious
problem of terrorism. Rather, we focus on what we believe to be the
somewhat broader essence of the security challenge that modern states
and individuals alike now face: [that the new world of many-to-many
threats and defenses puts enormous power---for good and evil alike---in
the hands of an unprecedented array of actors, making us all at once
more powerful and more vulnerable. That power increasingly includes the
power to attack---for whatever reason and by whatever type of actor---at
great distance and with diminished accountability]{.underline}. An
honest focus on the world of many-to-many threats demands a look back at
some basic premises of liberal society. In a world in which everyone
plays a role in everyone else's equation of threats and defenses and
national and individual security are hopelessly intertwined, old
governance questions demand new answers. We have not yet, as a society,
figured out how to redesign the relationships between citizens and their
governments, among governments internationally, or among people
themselves for the provision of basic security and freedom in a
technologically changing environment. [We have not yet given adequate
thought to how afraid we are of the countless Little Brothers and
MediumSized Brothers our technology is creating---and whether fear of
all these lesser brethren ought to imply some role for their biggest
sibling in keeping them all in check. It is time to start doing so, and
in these pages we take a preliminary stab at suggesting how one might go
about it. In doing so, we also attempt to integrate several debates that
seem to take place largely in stovepiped abstraction from one another,
despite their being, in our judgment, flip sides of the same coin---or,
more precisely, multiple sides of the same die]{.underline}. America
today has a cybersecurity debate. It has a smaller biosecurity debate. A
heated debate surrounds the use of drones in the war on terrorism and,
to a lesser extent, in the civilian sector domestically. We have a rich
debate over privacy and civil liberties. Yet there is far less overlap
among these debates than there ought to be. Cybersecurity experts will
talk about the novelty of their security arena and mention the facts
that attacks can be hard to attribute, capacity to launch attacks has
proliferated very far, and the costs of computing power keep falling. Go
to a conference on biosecurity and you will hear all of the same
themes---discussed with an equal sense of menace and novelty---but with
reference to an entirely different set of technologies. 12 Debates about
drones and targeted killings tend also to be constrained, often ignoring
the impending proliferation of drones and other types of lethal robots
far beyond the US government---or any government---and for uses far
beyond counterterrorism. The contemporary American debate contrives to
define privacy values as existing in tension with cybersecurity goals
rather than seeing good security and strong government enforcement as
essential protections for privacy. We aim here to discuss these issues
at a high altitude and to explore how these many issues flow from the
same underlying fact: that technologies of radical empowerment are
spreading in fashions that render us all both radically strong and
radically threatened.

#### Pandemics are a worldwide existential issue -- cooperation is key to solve

human lives, global economic security: New report,
<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160113132805.htm>) DR

\"We have neglected this dimension of global security,\" said Commission
chair Peter Sands, former group chief executive officer, Standard
Chartered PLC in London, and senior fellow, Mossavar-Rahmani Center for
Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy school in Cambridge,
Mass. \"[Pandemics don\'t respect national boundaries, so [we have a
common interest in strengthening]{.mark} our [defenses against]{.mark}
infectious [diseases in every part of the world]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Preventing and [preparing for]{.mark} potentially catastrophic
[pandemics is]{.mark} far more [effective]{.mark} \-- [and]{.mark}
ultimately, far [less expensive]{.mark} \-- [than reacting]{.mark} to
them [when they occur, which they will]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" For
example, in the past 15 years, the world faced several infectious
disease crises, including Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the influenza
virus known as H1N1. The Commission\'s own estimates suggest that at
least one pandemic will emerge over the next 100 years, with a 20
percent chance of seeing four or more. To protect against these threats,
[the [top priority must be to reinforce the first line of defense
against]{.mark} potential [pandemics]{.mark}, [public health]{.mark}
capabilities, [and infrastructure]{.mark} at a national level, [even
in]{.mark} failed or [fragile states]{.mark}]{.underline}, because
regional or global capabilities cannot compensate for deficiencies at a
national or local level. [[This requires]{.mark} governments to
prioritize [investment in their health systems]{.mark}, as part of their
fundamental duty to protect their people]{.underline}, the report says.
It also requires effective engagement of communities, given the vital
role they play in outbreak detection and response. Countries like Uganda
have demonstrated that even where resources are scarce, it is possible
to strengthen health systems and contain infectious disease outbreaks.

#### Pandemics pose an existential threat to the human race -- timeframe is now

**Srivasta**, doctor, inventor, publisher, January 12, **17**

(Kadiyali, Superbug Pandemics and How to Prevent Them,
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/01/12/superbug-pandemics-and-how-to-prevent-them/>)
DR

As [antibiotics become increasingly ineffective, [we must find]{.mark}
other [ways to prevent these disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is by
now no secret that [[the human species is locked in a race]{.mark} of
its own making [with "superbugs."]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, if
popular science fiction is a measure of awareness, the theme has
pervaded English-language literature from Michael Crichton's
1969 Andromeda Strain all the way to Emily St. John Mandel's
2014 Station Eleven and beyond. By a combination of massive inadvertence
and what can only be called stupidity, [[we must]{.mark} now
[invent]{.mark} new and effective [antibiotics faster than]{.mark}
deadly [bacteria evolve]{.mark}]{.underline}---[and regrettably, [they
are rapidly doing so with our help]{.mark}]{.underline}. I do not
exclude the possibility that bad actors might deliberately engineer
deadly superbugs.^1^ But even if that does not happen, [[humanity faces
an existential threat largely of its own making]{.mark} in the absence
of malign intentions]{.underline}. As threats go, this one is entirely
predictable. The concept of a "black swan," Nassim Nicholas Taleb's term
for low-probability but high-impact events, has become widely known in
recent years. Taleb did not invent the concept; he only gave it a catchy
name to help mainly business executives who know little of statistics or
probability. Many have embraced the "black swan" label the way children
embrace holiday gifts, which are often bobbles of little value, except
to them. But [[the threat of]{.mark} inadvertent
[pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline} is not a "black swan" because its
probability is not low. If one likes catchy labels, it better fits the
term "gray rhino," which, explains Michele Wucker, [[is a
high-probability, high-impact event]{.mark} that people manage to ignore
anyway for a raft of social-psychological reasons]{.underline}.^2^A
pandemic is a quintessential gray rhino, for it is no longer a matter of
if but of when it will challenge us---and of how prepared we are to deal
with it when it happens. We have certainly been warned. The curse we
have created was understood as a possibility from the very outset, when
seventy years ago Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin,
predicted antibiotic resistance. When interviewed for a 2015 article,
"The Most Predictable Disaster in the History of the Human Race, " [Bill
Gates pointed out that [one of the costliest disasters]{.mark} of the
20^th^ century]{.underline}, worse even than World War I, [[was the
Spanish Flu]{.mark} pandemic of 1918-19]{.underline}. As the author of
the article, Ezra Klein, put it: ["[No one can say we weren't
warned]{.mark}. And warned. And warned.]{.underline} [[A
pandemic]{.mark} disease [is the most predictable catastrophe]{.mark} in
the history of the human race]{.underline}, if only because it has
happened to the human race so many, many times before."^3^ Even with
effective new medicines, if we can devise them, [[we must contain
outbreaks]{.mark} of bacterial disease [fast]{.mark}]{.underline}, lest
they get out of control. In other words, we have a social-organizational
challenge before us as well as a strictly medical one. That means
getting sufficient amounts of medicine into the right hands and in the
right places, but it also means educating people and enabling them to
communicate with each other to prevent any outbreak from spreading
widely. Responsible governments and cooperative organizations have
options in that regard, but even individuals can contribute something.
To that end, as a medical doctor I have created a computer app that
promises to be useful in that regard---of which more in a moment. But
first let us review the situation, for while it has become well known to
many people, there is a general resistance to acknowledging the severity
and imminence of the danger. What Are the Problems? Bacteria are among
the oldest living things on the planet. They are masters of survival and
can be found everywhere. Billions of them live on and in every one of
us, many of them helping our bodies to run smoothly and stay healthy.
Most bacteria that are not helpful to us are at least harmless, but some
are not. They invade our cells, spread quickly, and cause havoc that we
refer to generically as disease. [Millions of people used to die every
year as a result of bacterial infections, until we developed
antibiotics]{.underline}. These wonder drugs revolutionized medicine,
but one can have too much of a good thing. [[Doctors have used
antibiotics recklessly]{.mark}, prescribing them for just about
everything, [and]{.mark} in the process [helped to create]{.mark}
strains of [bacteria that are resistant to the medicines]{.mark} we
have.]{.underline} We even give antibiotics to cattle that are not sick
and use them to fatten chickens. Companies large and small still
mindlessly market antimicrobial products for hands and home, claiming
that they kill bacteria and viruses. [[They do more harm than
good]{.mark} because the low concentrations of antimicrobials that these
products contain tend to kill friendly bacteria (not viruses at all),
and so clear the way for the mass multiplication of surviving unfriendly
bacteria. Perhaps even worse, hospitals have deployed antimicrobial
products on an industrial scale for a long time now, the result being a
sharp rise in iatrogenic bacterial illnesses.]{.underline} [[Overuse of
antibiotics]{.mark} and commercial products containing them [has helped
superbugs]{.mark} to [evolve]{.mark}]{.underline}. We now increasingly
face microorganisms that cannot be killed by antibiotics, antifungals,
antivirals, or any other chemical weapon we throw at them. Pandemics are
the major risk we run as a result, but it is not the only one. Overuse
of antibiotics by doctors, homemakers, and hospital managers could mean
that, in the not-too-distant future, something as simple as a minor cut
could again become life-threatening if it becomes infected. Few
non-medical professionals are aware that antibiotics are the foundation
on which nearly all of modern medicine rests. Cancer therapy, organ
transplants, surgeries minor and major, and even childbirth all rely on
antibiotics to prevent infections. If infections become untreatable we
stand to lose most of the medical advances we have made over the past
fifty years.

#### Pandemics are more dangerous than ever because of advances in globalization and travel -- empirics don't apply

Today, [a disease can travel faster than ever before]{.underline}.
[[Thanks to]{.mark} long distance [air travel]{.mark}, [an]{.mark}
infectious [agent can quickly spread to all
continents]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, most humans are now connected
by one or more of our rapid transportation networks. On the other hand,
enormous effort is being expended to prevent pandemics today. Serious
work can be done on many fronts simultaneously because [[pandemics arise
out of interactions between large numbers of people]{.mark}, animals,
and institutions]{.underline}. Unfortunately, this [[complexity]{.mark}
also [means that]{.mark} for the foreseeable future [our defenses will
not be perfect and our uncertainty will be extreme]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The [complexity]{.mark} of pandemics [is]{.mark} also [the
reason]{.mark} why straightforward [extrapolations from history tend to
be]{.mark} deeply [flawed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Human civilization
today is unprecedented]{.underline} in several relevant ways. We can't
study past examples of globe-spanning civilizations who actively tried
to protect themselves from this danger. Knowledge of past pandemics is
still incredibly valuable, it's just very hard to meaningfully
generalize to our situation.

### !! -- Democracy

#### NATO promotes democratic ideals, improves government structures, and allows for reliable security guarantees -- preserving relations is crucial

**Epstein**, Professor of International Relations at the Josef Korbel
School of International Studies at the University of Denver, September
13, **2016**

(Rachel, "Why NATO Enlargement Was a Good Idea,"
<https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2016/09/13/why-nato-enlargement-was-a-good-idea/>)
DR

Research shows that [[NATO made three contributions
to]{.underline}]{.mark} security and [[stability in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} (and by extension for the US)
[[through]{.mark} its [enlargement]{.mark} policy]{.underline} (see
studies by Gheciu and Epstein). [[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order
[[for post-communist countries to join]{.mark} NATO, [they had to
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline} regional [[rivalries through peace]{.mark}
treaties [with]{.mark} their [neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} alone [[had a pacifying effect among
countries with]{.mark} historically [contested borders]{.mark},
diasporas, and sizable minorities, all [against a backdrop]{.mark} of
intense [nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Second]{.mark}, [NATO
pushed aspiring]{.mark} member-[states toward democratic]{.mark}
civil-[military]{.mark} [relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Eastern Europe
had little democratic experience by 1990 and therefore no history of
democratic oversight of the armed forces. [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}
common [[misconception is that Communist]{.mark} Party [control over
militaries eased the transition]{.mark} to democratic civil-military
relations.]{.underline} [In actual fact, [however,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[East]{.mark}ern [Europe had]{.mark} a long-standing tradition of
[executive oversight with little transparency]{.mark}, accountability,
[or civilian]{.mark} military [expertise that predated
communism]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[So East European armies in the]{.mark}
19[90s engaged in]{.mark}]{.underline} their own arms deals,
church-building, and [[high-level political decision-making with
little]{.underline}]{.mark} civilian or public [[scrutiny]{.mark},
including over defense spending]{.underline}. [[NATO reapportioned
authority away from executives and enfranchised ministries of defense
and parliaments.]{.mark}]{.underline} It also trained civilians and
military personnel alike in the desirability of broad-based supervision,
including by the media and civil society organizations.

[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark} and probably most controversially, [[NATO
provided]{.mark} this phalanx of [small, weak]{.mark}, and historically
vulnerable [states its Article V security
guarantee]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There is evidence that [enhanced
security through NATO]{.mark} membership has [undermined
nationalistic]{.mark}]{.underline} policy and [[rhetoric that had
depended on narratives of victimization]{.mark}, even if current
illiberal governments in Poland and Hungary suggest that
NATO]{.underline} (and even EU membership) [have not been sufficient to
keep exclusionary politics at bay]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the region
is no longer the security vacuum that it once was, which might have
confined Russian aggression to countries outside of NATO's orbit.

#### [Liberal democracy]{.underline} solves [every impact]{.underline}

Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women\'s
Issues of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,

[As one of the countless millions of people who were freed or protected
from totalitarianism by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates of
America, [it is easy for me to talk about the past]{.underline}. To talk
about the belief of the American people and their leaders that this
country was exceptional, and had special responsibilities to match its
tremendous power. That a nation founded on freedom was bound to defend
freedom everywhere. I could talk about the bipartisan legacy of this
most American principle, from the Founding Fathers, to Democrats like
Harry Truman, to Republicans like Ronald Reagan. [I could talk about how
the American people used to care deeply about human rights and
dissidents in far-off places, and how this is what made America a beacon
of hope, a shining city on a hill. America led by example and set a high
standard, a standard that exposed the hypocrisy and cruelty of
dictatorships around the world]{.underline}.

But there is no time for nostalgia. [Since the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War,
Americans]{.underline}, and America, [have retreated from those
principles]{.underline}, [and the world has become much worse off as a
result]{.underline}. American skepticism about America's role in the
world deepened in the long, painful wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and
their aftermaths. Instead of applying the lessons learned about how to
do better, lessons about faulty intelligence and working with native
populations, the main outcome was to stop trying.

[This result has been a tragedy for the billions of people still living
under authoritarian regimes around the world, and it is based on faulty
analysis. You can never guarantee a positive outcome]{.underline}--- not
in chess, not in war, and certainly not in politics. [The best you can
do is to do what you know is right and to try your best]{.underline}. I
speak from experience when I say that [the citizens of unfree states do
not expect guarantees. They want a reason to hope and a fighting chance.
People living under dictatorships want the opportunity for freedom, the
opportunity to live in peace and to follow their dreams. From the Iraq
War to the Arab Spring to the current battles for liberty from Venezuela
to Eastern Ukraine, people are fighting for that opportunity, giving up
their lives for freedom. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[must not abandon them]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the rest of the free
world has an unprecedented advantage in economic and military
strength]{.underline} today. [What is lacking is the will]{.underline}.
The will [to make the case to the American people, the will to take
risks and invest in the long-term security of the country, and the
world. This will require investments in aid, in education, in security
that allow countries to attain the stability their people so badly need.
Such investment is far more moral and far cheaper than the cycle of
**terror**, **war**, **refugees**, and **military intervention** that
results when America leaves a vacuum of power. The best way to help
refugees is to prevent them from becoming refugees in the first
place]{.underline}.

[The Soviet Union was an existential threat]{.underline}, and this
focused the attention of the world, and the American people.
[The]{.underline}re [**existential threat** today is not found on a map,
but **it is very real**. The forces of the past are making steady
progress against the modern world order. **Terrorist movements in the
Middle East**, **extremist parties across Europe**, a **paranoid tyrant
in North Korea threatening nuclear blackmail**, and]{.underline}, at the
center of the web, [**an aggressive KGB dictator in Russia**. They all
want to turn the world back to a dark past because their survival is
threatened by the values of the free world, epitomized by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [And they are thriving as the
U.S. has retreated. The global freedom index has declined for ten
consecutive years. No one like to talk about the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as a global policeman, but **this is what happens
when there is no cop on the beat**. American leadership **begins at
home**]{.underline}, right here. [America cannot lead the world on
democracy and human rights if there is no unity on the meaning and
importance of these things. Leadership is required to make that case
clearly and powerfully]{.underline}. Right now, [Americans are engaged
in politics at a level not seen in decades. It is an opportunity for
them to rediscover that making America great begins with believing
America can be great]{.underline}.

[The Cold War was won on American values that were shared by both
parties and nearly every American]{.underline}. Institutions that were
created by a Democrat, Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks
to the courage of a Republican, Reagan. [This bipartisan consistency
created the decades of strategic stability that is the great strength of
democracies. Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for
long-range planning. In contrast, dictators can operate only tactically,
not strategically, because they are not constrained by the balance of
powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival. This is
why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability to move
quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals that are
based on shared values, not on polls and cable news]{.underline}.

[The fear of making things worse has paralyzed the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from trying to make things better. There will
always be setbacks, but the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[cannot quit. **The spread of democracy is the only proven remedy for
nearly every crisis that plagues the world today. War, famine, poverty,
terrorism--all are generated and exacerbated by authoritarian regimes.**
A policy of America First inevitably puts American security
last]{.underline}.

[American leadership is required because **there is no one else**, and
because it is good for America. There is no weapon or wall that is more
powerful for security than America being **envied**, **imitated**, and
**admired** around the world. Admired **not for being perfect**, but for
having the exceptional courage to always **try to be
better**]{.underline}. Thank you.

#### US democracy is key to international collective action on multiple existential threats and to prevent war---backsliding causes those systems to unravel

**Kendall-Taylor,** deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and
Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, **16** (Andrea, 07.15.16,
"How Democracy's Decline Would Undermine the International Order,"

np

It is rare that policymakers, analysts, and academics agree. But [there
is an emerging consensus in the world of foreign policy: threats to the
stability of the current international order are rising.]{.underline}
The norms, values, laws, and institutions that have undergirded the
international system and governed relationships between nations are
being gradually dismantled. [The most discussed sources of this pressure
are the ascent of China and]{.underline} other non-Western countries,
[Russia's assertive foreign policy,]{.underline} and the diffusion of
power from traditional nation-states to nonstate actors, such as
nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and
technology-empowered individuals. [Largely missing from these
discussions]{.underline}, however, [is the specter of widespread
democratic decline. Rising challenges to democratic governance across
the globe are a major strain on the international system,]{.underline}
but they receive far less attention in discussions of the shifting world
order. In the 70 years since the end of World War II, the United States
has fostered a global order dominated by states that are liberal,
capitalist, and democratic. The United States has promoted the spread of
democracy to strengthen global norms and rules that constitute the
foundation of our current international system. However, [despite the
steady rise of democracy since the end of the Cold War, over the last 10
years we have seen dramatic reversals in respect for democratic
principles across the globe]{.underline}. A 2015 Freedom House report
stated that the ["acceptance of democracy as the world's dominant form
of government---and of an international system built on democratic
ideals---is under greater threat than at any point]{.underline} in the
last 25 years." [Although the number of democracies in the world is at
an all-time high, there are a number of key trends that are working to
undermine democracy. The rollback of democracy in a few influential
states or even in a number of less consequential ones would almost
certainly accelerate meaningful changes in today's global order.
Democratic decline would weaken]{.underline} U.S. [partnerships and
erode an important foundation]{.underline} [for]{.underline} U.S.
[cooperation]{.underline} abroad. Research demonstrates that domestic
politics are a key determinant of the international behavior of states.
In particular, [democracies are more likely to form alliances and
cooperate more fully with other democracies than with
autocracies.]{.underline} Similarly, [authoritarian countries have
established mechanisms for cooperation and sharing of "worst practices."
An increase in authoritarian countries, then, would provide a broader
platform for]{.underline} coordination that could enable these
[countries to overcome their divergent histories, values, and
interests---]{.underline}factors that are frequently cited as obstacles
to the formation of a cohesive challenge to the U.S.-led international
system. Recent examples support the empirical data. [Democratic
backsliding in Hungary and the hardening of Egypt's
autocracy]{.underline} under Abdel Fattah el-Sisi [have led to enhanced
relations between these countries and Russia.]{.underline} Likewise,
[democratic decline in Bangladesh has led Sheikh Hasina Wazed and her
ruling Awami League to seek closer relations with China and Russia, in
part to mitigate Western pressure and bolster the regime's domestic
standing.]{.underline} Although none of these burgeoning relationships
has developed into a highly unified partnership, democratic backsliding
in these countries has provided a basis for cooperation where it did not
previously exist. And while the United States certainly finds common
cause with authoritarian partners on specific issues, the depth and
reliability of such cooperation is limited. Consequently, [further
democratic decline could seriously compromise the]{.underline} United
States' [ability to form the kinds of deep partnerships that will be
required to confront today's increasingly complex challenges. Global
issues such as climate change, migration, and violent extremism demand
the coordination and cooperation that democratic backsliding would put
in peril.]{.underline} Put simply, [the United States is a less
effective and influential actor if it loses its ability to rely on its
partnerships with other democratic nations.]{.underline} [A slide toward
authoritarianism could also challenge the current global order by
diluting U.S. influence in critical international
institutions,]{.underline} including the United Nations , the World
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). [Democratic decline
would weaken Western efforts within these institutions to advance issues
such as Internet freedom and the responsibility to protect]{.underline}.
In the case of Internet governance, for example, Western democracies
support an open, largely private, global Internet. Autocracies, in
contrast, promote state control over the Internet, including laws and
other mechanisms that facilitate their ability to censor and persecute
dissidents. Already many autocracies, including Belarus, China, Iran,
and Zimbabwe, have coalesced in the "Likeminded Group of Developing
Countries" within the United Nations to advocate their interests. Within
the IMF and World Bank, autocracies---along with other developing
nations---seek to water down conditionality or the reforms that lenders
require in exchange for financial support. If successful, diminished
conditionality would enfeeble an important incentive for governance
reforms. In a more extreme scenario, the rising influence of autocracies
could enable these countries to bypass the IMF and World Bank all
together. For example, the Chinese-created Asian Infrastructure and
Investment Bank and the BRICS Bank---which includes Russia, China, and
an increasingly authoritarian South Africa---provide countries with the
potential to bypass existing global financial institutions when it suits
their interests. [Authoritarian-led alternatives pose the risk that
global economic governance will become fragmented and less effective.
Violence and instability would also likely increase if more democracies
give way to autocracy. International relations literature tells us that
democracies are less likely to fight wars against other democracies,
suggesting that interstate wars would rise]{.underline} as the number of
democracies declines. Moreover, within countries that are already
autocratic, [additional movement away from democracy]{.underline}, or an
"authoritarian hardening," would increase global instability. [Highly
repressive autocracies are the most likely to experience state failure,
as was the case in the Central African Republic, Libya, Somalia, Syria,
and Yemen]{.underline}. In this way, [democratic decline would
significantly strain the international order because rising levels of
instability would exceed the West's ability to respond to the tremendous
costs of peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and refugee
flows]{.underline}. Finally, [widespread democratic decline would
contribute to rising anti-U.S. sentiment that could fuel a global order
that is increasingly antagonistic to the United States and its
values]{.underline}. Most autocracies are highly suspicious of U.S.
intentions and view the creation of an external enemy as an effective
means for boosting their own public support. Russian president Vladimir
Putin, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, and Bolivian president Evo
Morales regularly accuse the United States of fomenting instability and
supporting regime change. This vilification of the United States is a
convenient way of distracting their publics from regime shortcomings and
fostering public support for strongman tactics.

### \--AT: DPT Wrong

#### Empirical data is on our side

**Hegre 2018** - Department of Peace and Conflict Research Uppsala
University\
Håvard, Michael Bernhard, Jan Teorell, \"Reassessing the Democratic
Peace: A Novel Test Based on the Varieties of Democracy Data,\" Working
Paper SERIES 2018:64 THE VARIETIES OF DEMOCRACY INSTITUTE

In this article we have introduced two novelties into the study of the
democratic peace. First, we make use of the [[V-Dem data]{.mark} and
demonstrate that it [improves on Polity, the dominant measure in]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [lit]{.mark}eratur]{.underline}e, along at least two
dimensions. First, [[V-Dem has a superior]{.mark} concept-to-measurement
[consistency]{.mark},]{.underline} given its starting point was the
overt modeling of democracy. Moreover, [the V-Dem data are vastly more
detailed than Polity]{.underline}, allowing us to operationalize much
more precise theoretical mechanisms than the simpler datasets.
Accordingly, [our fit tests show that [our V-Dem-based indices model the
democratic peace much better than Polity]{.mark}]{.underline}, both in
terms of in-sample goodness of fit and out-of-sample predictive
performance.

Second, and more importantly, we have identified a subset of the
multiplicity of democracy's attributes that seem to explain its ability
to deter war-like behavior. [Specifically we show that, when entered
individually, electoral accountability, judicial and legislative
constraints on the executive, media freedom and civil society
participation promote the democratic peace]{.underline}, when
controlling for the other standard determinants of inter-state disputes.
When pitted against each other, however, only horizontal constraints on
the executive and civil society participation continue to have a direct
effect on dyadic peace. We thus find most consistent support for the
horizontal and informal-vertical accountability mechanisms underlying
the democratic peace. Earlier we cited the claim of Maoz and Russett
(1993, 626) that 'the mobilization of ... general public opinion'
matters at the same order of importance as the 'variety of institutions
that make up the system of government'. Our findings provide support for
the institutional side of their claims but to some extent contradict
what they say about social mobilization. [[We confirm important aspects
of]{.mark} earlier work on the [democratic peace]{.mark}]{.underline}
such as Doyle's (1983a,b) 'liberal peace' argument and Choi's (2010)
focus on legislative veto players. However, our results on the role of
civil society suggest that social mobilization is also important[. The
exclusion of the peace-making role of civil society in this literature
may well be a function of the past paucity of data to measure
it]{.underline}. Given the strong model fit and predictive performance
of the models that include this new V-Dem variable, this omission has
been an important oversight in the literature from the perspective of
our constraint-based theorization of the mechanisms behind the
democratic peace.

At first sight, the policy implication of these findings would seem
clear: [in order to promote international security, what needs
strengthening is not electoral competitiveness or the quality of
elections but horizontal mechanisms of effective constraints on the
executive]{.underline}, a more vibrant civil society that monitors and
constrains those exercising executive power, or a combination of the
two. [If the goal is order in the international system, legislative and
judicial reforms should trump electoral reform, and the promotion of the
initiatives of an organized and active citizenry in civil society seems
more important than the strengthening of opposition political
parties]{.underline}. However, in as much as the mechanism of electoral
accountability is connected to these other aspects of democracy, it
cannot be easily dismissed from a policy agenda to promote peace. Most
importantly, it cannot be ruled out that the promotion of electoral
accountability is also a way of strengthening the other accountability
mechanisms. Students of judicial independence and oversight, for
example, tend to stress the logic of the "insurance argument", which
holds that competitiveness at the polls undergirds executive support for
judicial constraints by creating uncertainty about the future prospects
of staying in office (for an overview, see Vanberg 2015). Similarly, to
the extent that the state can constrain and harass civil society, the
strength of civil society is arguably not simply an independent source
of its own but is guaranteed by the sort of robust competition at the
polls that protects the freedoms of association and expression that
civil society requires.

Despite our reticence to completely reject the impact of electoral
accountability, we still believe [[we have moved the democratic peace
literature forward]{.mark}]{.underline} by stressing the stronger
relative importance of the non-electoral mechanisms of accountability.
[[The essence of constraint is preventing those who exercise executive
power from acting in an arbitrary and ill-advised fashion, leading
to]{.mark} destructive forms of [interstate
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The electoral mechanism does
determine who holds executive office, but its constraining power is time
dependent, tied to the elections cycle. Both the vertical constraining
power of civil society and horizontal constraints posed the
countervailing powers of the legislative and judicial branches of
government are not dependent on the timing of elections, but consistent
over time. This plausibly helps to explain why they are a more effective
constraint on the kinds of arbitrary executive action that pose a threat
to peace than the constraints posed by threat of losing office in the
future.

#### Their authors use overlimiting definitions of democracy to make their point -- don't buy it

**Pinker 2018** -- Johnstone Professor of Psychology @ Harvard\
Steven, *Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and
Progress,* Penguin Press, Chap 14

Why has the tide of democratization repeatedly exceeded expectations?
[[The]{.mark} various backslidings, reversals, and [black holes for
democracy have led to theories which posit onerous prerequisites and an
agonizing ordeal of democratization]{.mark}. (]{.underline}This serves
as a convenient pretext for dictators to insist that their countries are
not ready for it, like the revolutionary leader in Woody Allen's Bananas
who upon taking power announces, "These people are peasants. They are
too ignorant to vote.") [[The awe is reinforced by a civics-class
idealization of democracy]{.mark} in which an informed populace
deliberates]{.underline} about the common good and carefully [selects
leaders who carry out their preference]{.underline}.

**[[By that standard, the number of democracies in the world is
zero]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the past, zero in the present, and almost
certainly zero in the future. Political scientists are repeatedly
astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people's political
beliefs, and by the tenuous connection of their preferences to their
votes and to the behavior of their representatives.21 Most voters are
ignorant not just of current policy options but of basic facts, such as
what the major branches of government are, who the United States fought
in World War II, and which countries have used nuclear weapons. Their
opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: they say that the
government spends too much on "welfare" but too little on "assistance to
the poor," and that it should "use military force" but not "go to war."
When they do formulate a preference, they commonly vote for a candidate
with the opposite one. But it hardly matters, because once in office
politicians vote the positions of their party regardless of the opinions
of their constituents.

Nor does voting even provide much of a feedback signal about a
government's performance. Voters punish incumbents for recent events
over which they have dubious control, such as macroeconomic swings and
terrorist strikes, or no control at all, such as droughts, floods, even
shark attacks. Many political scientists have concluded that most people
correctly recognize that their votes are astronomically unlikely to
affect the outcome of an election, and so they prioritize work, family,
and leisure over educating themselves about politics and calibrating
their votes. They use the franchise as a form of self-expression: they
vote for candidates who they think are like them and stand for their
kind of people.

[So despite the widespread belief that elections are the quintessence of
democracy, they are only one of the mechanisms by which a government is
held responsible to those it governs]{.underline}, and not always a
constructive one. When an election is a contest between aspiring
despots, rival factions fear the worst if the other side wins and try to
intimidate each other from the ballot box. Also, autocrats can learn to
use elections to their advantage. The latest fashion in dictatorship has
been called the competitive, electoral, kleptocratic, statist, or
patronal authoritarian regime.22 (Putin's Russia is the prototype.) The
incumbents use the formidable resources of the state to harass the
opposition, set up fake opposition parties, use state-controlled media
to spread congenial narratives, manipulate electoral rules, tilt voter
registration, and jigger the elections themselves. (Patronal
authoritarians, for all that, are not invulnerable---the color
revolutions sent several of them packing.)

If neither voters nor elected leaders can be counted on to uphold the
ideals of democracy, why should this form of government work so
not-badly---the worst form of government except all the others that have
been tried, as Churchill famously put it? In his 1945 book The Open
Society and Its Enemies, the philosopher Karl Popper argued that
democracy should be understood not as the answer to the question "Who
should rule?" (namely, "The People"), but as a solution to the problem
of how to dismiss bad leadership without bloodshed.23 The political
scientist John Mueller broadens the idea from a binary Judgment Day to
continuous day-to-day feedback. Democracy, he suggests, is essentially
based on giving people the freedom to complain: "It comes about when the
people effectively agree not to use violence to replace the leadership,
and the leadership leaves them free to try to dislodge it by any other
means."24 He explains how this can work:

[[If citizens have the right to]{.mark} complain, to petition, to
organize, to protest, to demonstrate, to strike, to threaten to emigrate
or secede]{.underline}, to shout, to publish, to export their funds, to
[[express a lack of confidence,]{.mark} and to wheedle in back
corridors, [government will tend to respond]{.mark} to the sounds of the
shouters and the importunings of the wheedlers]{.underline}: that is, it
will necessarily become responsive---[pay attention---whether there are
elections or not.25]{.underline}

[[Women's suffrage is an example]{.underline}]{.mark}: by definition,
[t[hey could not vote]{.underline}]{.mark} [to grant themselves the
vote[, but they got it by other means.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The contrast between [the messy reality of democracy and the
civics-class ideal leads to perennial
disillusionment]{.mark}]{.underline}. John Kenneth Galbraith once
advised that if you ever want a lucrative book contract, just propose to
write The Crisis of American Democracy. Reviewing the history, Mueller
concludes that "inequality, disagreement, apathy, and ignorance seem to
be normal, not abnormal, in a democracy, and to a considerable degree
the beauty of the form is that it works despite these qualities---or, in
some important respects, because of them."26

In this minimalist conception, democracy is not a particularly abstruse
or demanding form of government. Its main prerequisite is that a
government be competent enough to protect people from anarchic violence
so they don't fall prey to, or even welcome, the first strongman who
promises he can do the job. (Chaos is deadlier than tyranny.) That's one
reason why democracy has trouble getting a toehold in extremely poor
countries with weak governments, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, and in
countries whose government has been decapitated, such as Afghanistan and
Iraq following the American-led invasions. As the political scientists
Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way point out, "State failure brings violence
and instability; it almost never brings democratization."27

### !! -- Climate Change

#### NATO solves climate change but strong relations are key 

**Schewe**, PhD in Modern Middle Eastern History from the University of
Michigan, **18**

(Eric,
https://daily.jstor.org/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-issue/)

[Climate change has not received nearly the same attention or resources
from the government]{.underline} as the other new existential security
campaign of the twenty-first century---the "War on Terror." Granted, the
September 11th, 2001 attack was a much more spectacular and specific
disaster than creeping global temperatures, and the targets of
retaliation, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, more vivid. But the rhetorical
process of "securitizing" one threat or another follows similar
processes---passing legislation, mobilizing budgetary and bureaucratic
resources to confront the threat, the appearance of political interest
groups around the new objective, and the manipulation of public opinion
to support new policies. Peter Engelke and Daniel Chiu of the Atlantic
Council examine the potential effects of tying climate security more
explicitly to U.S. national security. While it can create urgency behind
the issue, it also can lead to "overly nationalistic or militarized
solutions to problems, which are inherently transnational and that
require nonmilitary responses to solve them." Viewing the climate crisis
through a security lens makes it easier for politicians like President
Trump to dehumanize refugee victims, portraying them as the true threat
to the powerful countries to which they are trying to migrate. He is
amplifying these fears in the weeks leading to the 2018 midterm
elections. [Given the inevitability of military interest in climate
change, a compromise between particular national and global-scale
efforts may be in regional treaty organizations such as
NATO.]{.underline} Amar Causevic investigates the way inter-military
cooperation in [NATO can help member states pool resources and research
about the crisis, and identify collectively with threats that may only
affect a few members. NATO is aiding cooperation in climate change
issues,]{.underline} which range from negotiating sovereignty conflicts
in the Arctic Sea to providing relief to neighboring states suffering
from climate-related crises, such as flooding in Bosnia and wetland
restoration in Central Asia. [NATO has its own Smart Energy Team seeking
to spread alternative energy sources in all member militaries. However,
the vitality of NATO and other regional and global organizations like
the U.N. is also dependent on domestic politics that support a vision of
global cooperation and accountability.]{.underline} Leaders like
President Trump, who has denounced the United States' financial
contributions to this long-term cornerstone of U.S. global hegemony, and
insulted its members, could well neutralize it as a positive source for
fighting climate change.

#### Cybersecurity is a huge *[up-and-coming risk]{.underline}* -- only *[NATO cooperation]{.underline}* solves

NATO forecasted today's cyber threat environment in 2010: "Cyber attacks
are becoming more frequent, more organized and more costly \[...\]; they
can reach a threshold that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic
prosperity, security and stability."6 **[NATO faces a cyber threat
landscape that abounds with hackers, hacktivists, nation-states, and
criminals. NATO itself has been targeted directly by Russian hackers
seeking information on its defensive posture against
Russia.]{.underline}**7 Furthermore, [the recent attack by Russia on the
Ukrainian power grid underscores the fact that Russian cyber attack
capabilities are very real]{.underline}.[8 NATO]{.underline} [also faces
the same types of cyber breaches that affect businesses in America on a
daily basis, ranging from random criminal acts to infiltrate NATO's
systems to those of a more sophisticated, targeted nature. **Despite
preventive measures, cyber criminals around the world continue to gain
access to these networks, including those that are
classified.**]{.underline}9 In all, the current threat environment
embodies much more significant risks than those first exemplified by the
Russian cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007, which initially prompted NATO
to address the dangers of cyber warfare. How did NATO get to its current
state in cybersecurity[? NATO has always defended its military
communication networks; however, during the 2002 Prague Summit, NATO
stated **that cyber defense was also part of its agenda** and that it
would strengthen its "capabilities to defend against cyber
attacks."]{.underline}10 The Prague Summit paved the way for NATO's
creation of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) in
2002. Following the cyber attacks against Estonia in April and May of
2007, NATO issued its first "Policy on Cyber Defence" in January 2008.
It later issued its "Strategic Concept" in 2011, as well as a newly
enhanced cyber defense policy in 201411 in which NATO clarified that
Article 5 could be invoked for a major digital attack.12 It also pledged
to improve cyber defense education, training, and exercise activities,
in addition to its commitment to create a NATO cyber range capability.13

[An **arc of latent nuclear instability** stretches around the globe.
From **Central Europe** through **South Asia** to **Northeast Asia** and
into the **seas surrounding China**, the nuclear weapons countries, or
their close allies, are involved in geopolitical, territorial and other
**disputes** that have the potential to combust and
**escalate**]{.underline}. The arc indeed girdles the world inasmuch as
instability lies in the nature of bilateral and multilateral
relationships [and is affected by global problems of proliferation,
terrorism, nuclear materials and weapons control, transparency and many
others]{.underline}. [Crisis management is more difficult in today's
security environment]{.underline} than it was in the bipolar world of
the Cold War. [Conflict dynamics are less stable]{.underline}. Under the
right conditions, [**any of the hotspots** along this arc could morph
into a **nuclear flashpoint**]{.underline}. [A nuclear crisis could
escalate through inadvertence or intention and also spread virally to
other parts of the world]{.underline}. Many countries possess nuclear
forces, and their postures are coupled, tightly in some cases and
loosely in others. [A nuclear confrontation or detonation would raise
nuclear tensions and alert levels around the world. Such a multipolar
nuclear crisis could follow an unpredictable course and prove difficult
to stabilize]{.underline}. This report identifies ways to control crisis
escalation and reduce the myriad risks of deliberate or unintentional
use of nuclear weapons. It is both diagnostic in that it examines the
risk of nuclear weapons use in the various nuclear weapons countries, as
well as prescriptive in offering some remedies. Any balanced assessment
of worldwide nuclear risk finds cause both for encouragement and
concern. One piece of good news is that the global stockpile of nuclear
weapons has plunged from a peak of 70,000 in the 1980s to approximately
16,000 today. If nuclear risk and stockpile size are correlated, then
dramatic progress has been achieved. But [the overall decline mCasks the
gloomy fact that some arsenals are growing rapidly and posing greater
risks, as in South Asia]{.underline}. This dichotomous pattern is
pervasive. A few examples: Good news: Russian nuclear weapons and
fissile materials are substantially more secure against theft today than
they were when the Soviet Union collapsed over two decades ago. Bad
news: (i) the world is home to sponsors of proliferation, nuclear black
markets, and promoters of terrorism, (ii) large quantities of nuclear
weapons are constantly in transit around the world -- and transportation
is the Achilles heel of security, and (iii) the risks of terrorist
capture of weapons and materials have increased in South Asia over the
past two decades. Pretty good news: the number of nations possessing
nuclear weapons has climbed slowly while a greater number of aspiring
proliferators have abandoned their programs. Bad news: the number of
nations that possess or aspire to possess a peaceful nuclear energy
program that could be transformed into a nuclear weapons program is fast
growing, and many of these potential proliferators are lacking in good
governance. Good and bad news: non-kinetic and conventional weapons
(offensive and defensive) and global surveillance and intelligence have
provided a credible alternative to nuclear weapons for some nations, but
they pose threats to other nations that lead them to increase their
reliance on nuclear weapons. While these overly simplified illustrations
of risk correlations present a mixed picture, [this commission finds an
overall pattern: risks are generally trending in the wrong
direction]{.underline}. The cup appears to be more than half empty [in
today's security environment of **proliferation**, **nuclear build-ups**
in Asia, spreading **extremism**, burgeoning **cyber war**fare,
vulnerable nuclear **c**ommand and **c**ontrol networks, vulnerable and
insecure nuclear weapons **storage sites** and **delivery
platforms**]{.underline} (particularly silo-based strategic missiles),
[and de-stabilizing **global military competition** featuring **rapid
innovation** in weapons technology and modalities of
warfare]{.underline}. In the current environment, much needs to be done
to reduce nuclear risks. [The slope from a **crisis** to **nuclear
brinksmanship** to **escalation** to the **use of nuclear weapons** with
**cascading global implications** is]{.underline} a [much **too steep
and slippery**]{.underline} one. This [latent instability is
tremendously aggravated by the simple fact that the amount of time for
decision-making at any point along this spectrum may be far too
short]{.underline}. In general, [**warning** and **decision**
**timelines** are **getting shorter**, and consequently the potential
for fateful **human error** in nuclear control systems is **getting
larger**]{.underline}. The short fuses on U.S. and Russian strategic
forces compound the risks. One-half of their strategic arsenals are
continuously maintained on high alert. Hundreds of missiles carrying
nearly 1,800 warheads are ready to fly at a moment's notice. These
legacy postures of the Cold War are anachronisms but they have not yet
been consigned to the trash heap of history. They remain fully
operational. These [postures]{.underline} -- [geared to very rapid
reaction]{.underline} -- [reflect an entrenched mindset of "**use or
lose**"]{.underline} with roots in the Cold War and in past decisions
that perpetuated vulnerabilities in strategic forces and their chain of
command. [**Bureaucratic inertia** perpetuated a status quo that
featured vulnerable land-based forces and nuclear command, control, and
communications networks prone to collapse under the weight of attack,
even a small-scale strike]{.underline}. [These vulnerabilities have not
gone away]{.underline}. In some respects [the situation was better
during the Cold War than it is today. Vulnerability to **cyber
attack**]{.underline}, for example, [is a **new wild card** in the deck.
Having many far-flung missiles controlled electronically through an
**aging and flawed** **c**ommand-**c**ontrol network and ready to launch
upon receipt of a short stream of computers signals is a
**nuclear**]{.underline} (surety) **[risk of the first
order]{.underline}**. It seems [the height of folly in an era of
**rapidly mutating cyber war**fare capabilities]{.underline}. This
concern is reason enough to remove nuclear missiles from launch-ready
alert.

**Burns**, PhD; **Jones**, former US National Security Advisor; **16**
(Nicholas, James, Atlantic Council: Brent Scowcroft Center on
International Security, "RESTORING THE POWER AND PURPOSE OF THE NATO
ALLIANCE," p. 8-9)//EF

[Russia is the primary cause of this new threat to NATO. Russia's
illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, its cynical war that divided
Ukraine, and its support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria
undermine the liberal international order and endanger security in both
Europe and the Middle East.]{.underline} At the Munich Security
Conference in February 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said
"Speaking bluntly, we are rapidly rolling into a period of a new cold
war." Following the conference, many analysts and observers were quick
to downplay or dismiss his comments. But allies should not be fooled.
[President Putin]{.underline} is a former KGB operative and has made his
views on NATO very clear. He [sees NATO as his adversary and the
collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest catastrophe of the
twentieth century.]{.underline} Allies should be crystal clear about the
threat at hand and take Prime Minister Medvedev at his word. [Moscow
aims to undermine the law-based principles of European security and the
liberal international order]{.underline} that the United States and its
European allies first established in the aftermath of World War II and
expanded after the fall of the Berlin Wall. **[It is not just the NATO
countries who have an interest in the preservation of this international
system. Democracies and law-based societies around the world have a
stake in preserving the global security order.]{.underline}** [Given its
hostile intent, Russia's \$700 billion military investment is a cause
for concern and a key reason US military officials repeatedly identify
Russia,]{.underline} once again, [as America's greatest existential
threat. Alliance officials express particular concern about Russia's
ability to deter NATO from responding to an Article 5 violation in
Europe's East. An imbalance of Russian firepower in Kaliningrad,
illegally annexed Crimea, and Syria may provide Russia an A2/AD
capability.]{.underline} This would prevent NATO militaries from
operating with freedom, even within Alliance territory. This creates
strategic imbalance on the Continent. [Russia's A2/AD capabilities are
particularly concerning given Russia's new military tactics in Europe,
from provocative snap military exercises with up to 100,000 troops to
hybrid warfare, which it has adopted and perfected in Ukraine and Syria.
In Syria, Russia demonstrated its ability to project power in the Middle
East]{.underline} and put its modernizing military to the test in
combat. [And in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions, Russian jets have
taken to the irresponsible]{.underline} and dangerous [practice of
"buzzing" allied warships]{.underline} operating in international waters
in an attempt [to intimidate NATO from conducting legitimate freedom of
maneuver operations.]{.underline} Coupled with its ability to deny
access to NATO militaries in theaters where it had once enjoyed
supremacy, this presents a grim picture for transatlantic defense
planners for any future military operation. Russia's threat to the
Baltics and Poland is welldocumented. But [the threat of an accidental
conflict between NATO and Russia is just as high in the Black Sea
region, where NATO allies Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey are situated.
The Russian threat to NATO's southeastern flank was largely overlooked
until Russia's military build-up in Syria in late]{.underline} 2015 to
support the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. [Russia's competition
with]{.underline} NATO member [Turkey over the future of northern Syria
has already resulted in the Turkish shoot-down of a Russian fighter and
a dramatic rise in tensions]{.underline} between Moscow and Ankara[.
Russia's recent militarization of illegally-annexed Crimea is of great
concern to]{.underline} allies such as Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania.
[Russia's military resurgence and renewed assertiveness is also a
challenge in the Arctic region and the high north.]{.underline} As part
of its military modernization, [Russia has established an Arctic
strategic command and developed new]{.underline}, or has revived and
modernized former Cold War, [military bases in the region. The Arctic is
also home to Russia's powerful Northern Fleet, which is currently being
modernized and includes Russia's seabased nuclear
deterrent.]{.underline} Russia's revised maritime doctrine also points
to the high north as the area from which Russia can access the broader
Atlantic with maritime forces. [**NATO has an Arctic frontier in the
high north that must be defended**.]{.underline} The United States,
Canada, Norway, and Denmark are all Arctic nations, but each ally takes
a different approach to security in the Arctic and the appropriate role
for NATO. The Alliance should seek to cooperate with Russia on the
Arctic where possible as a means of testing Russia's regional
intentions, which remain unclear. But NATO must also be prepared to
defend its boundaries and interests in the region in the face of growing
Russian capabilities. It is time to break the logjam within the Alliance
that has prevented serious discussions within NATO about its role in the
high north. [Russia's threatening tactics are not merely confined to
conventional weapons, hybrid warfare, or snap exercises. **Under
President Putin, Russia has enhanced its reliance on nuclear weapons and
engaged in dangerous nuclear gamesmanship and threats.**]{.underline} At
the Munich Security Conference in February 2016, NATO Secretary General
Stoltenberg properly recalled NATO's continued commitment to both
conventional and nuclear deterrence. [Russia is also one of the world's
most formidable cyber superpowers and possesses the ability to unleash a
strategically significant attack on Alliance military or civilian
infrastructure. While NATO has taken steps to strengthen the defenses of
NATO networks, the Alliance still does not treat cyber threats to
individual allies as a **whole alliance issue**.]{.underline} Finally,
Russia also uses its vast energy resources as a weapon in Europe to
divide allies from one another. The German-Russian Nordstream 2 gas
pipeline is just such an example of Russia's "divide and conquer" energy
diplomacy and should be rejected by Germany and the European Union. In
addition, Russian propaganda and suspected financial support for extreme
political parties in Europe undermines democratic governance across the
EU. To respond to this diverse array of challenges, the Alliance will
have to be nimble and flexible and forge a closer relationship with the
EU, which has competence in internal security matters.

#### No war -- Russia wants to cooperate with European countries and NATO will be hesitant to fight

**Tsygankov,** Professor at the Departments of Political Science and
International Relations at San Francisco State University, **16**
(Andrei, 02.19.16, "5 reasons why the threat of a global war involving
Russia is overstated," *Russia Direct*,
<http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/5-reasons-why-threat-great-power-war-involving-russia-overstated)>
np

First, [whatever the rhetoric, major powers are not inclined towards
risky behavior when their core interests are at stake]{.underline}. This
concerns not only the nuclear superpowers, but also countries such as
Turkey. The prospect of confronting Russia\'s overwhelmingly superior
military should give pause even to someone as hot-tempered as Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan. Even if Erdogan wanted to pit Russia against
NATO, it wouldn't work. So far, [NATO has been careful to not be drawn
into highly provocative actions, whether it is by responding to Russia
seizing the Pristina International Airport]{.underline} in June 1999,
[getting involved on Georgia's side during the military
conflict]{.underline} in August 2008 [or by providing lethal military
assistance and support for Ukraine. Unless Russia is the clear and
proven aggressor, NATO is unlikely to]{.underline} support Turkey and
[begin World War III.]{.underline} Second, [Russia remains a defensive
power aware of its responsibility for maintaining international
stability. Moscow wants to work with major powers, not against them. Its
insistence on Western recognition of Russia's interests must not be
construed as a drive to destroy the foundations of the international
order, such as sovereignty, multilateralism, and arms
control.]{.underline} Third, [the United States has important interests
to prevent regional conflicts from escalating or becoming
trans-regional]{.underline}. Although its relative military capabilities
are not where they were ten years ago, [the U.S. military and diplomatic
resources are sufficient to restrain key regional players in any part of
the world. Given the power rivalry across several regions,]{.underline}
[proxy wars are]{.underline} possible and indeed are happening, but they
are [unlikely to escalate]{.underline}. Fourth, unlike the Cold War era,
[the contemporary world has no rigid alliance structure.]{.underline}
The so-called Russia-China-Iran axis is hardly more than a figment of
the imagination by American neoconservatives and some Russia
conspiracy-minded thinkers. [The world remains a space in which
international coalitions overlap and are mostly formed on an ad hoc
basis.]{.underline} Fifth, with the exception of the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Greater Syria (ISIS), [there is no fundamental conflict of
values and ideologies. Despite the efforts to present as incompatible
the so-called "traditional" and "Western" values by Russia or
"democracy" to "autocracy" by the United States and Europe, the world
majority does not think that this cultural divide is worth fighting for.
Despite the dangers of the world we live in,]{.underline} [it contains a
number of]{.underline} important, even underappreciated, [checks on
great powers' militarism. The threat talk coming from politicians is
often deceiving. Such talk may be a way to pressure the opponent into
various political and military concessions rather than to signal real
intentions.]{.underline} When such pressures do not bring expected
results, the rhetoric of war and isolation subsides. Then a dialogue
begins. Perhaps, the increasing frequency of exchanges between Obama and
Putin since December 2015 - including their recent phone conversation
following the Munich conference - suggest a growing recognition that the
record of pressuring Russia has been mixed at best.

#### Russia doesn't want to start war -- and interdependence checks escalation

np

As Russian speakers are often exposed to Russian state media, [fears
have been expressed that Moscow may seek to stir unrest]{.underline}
among them. \"[Propaganda and information attacks are part of
\[Russian\] hybrid warfare]{.underline}. [They seek to
provoke]{.underline} social and ethnic [tensions]{.underline}, promote
mistrust in government, discredit our history, independence, and
statehood, [and demonstrate that Western democracy is functioning on
dual standards,]{.underline}\" said Lithuanian President Dalia
Grybauskaite in March. [Beyond unconventional warfare, there has also
been talk of the threat of a direct invasion. But]{.underline} Peter
[Duncan,]{.underline} a [senior lecturer in Russian Politics and Society
at University College London, told Al Jazeera: \"There is no reason for
Russia to want to threaten the sovereignty of the Baltic states in the
sense of trying to force them to leave NATO or still less to invade
them.]{.underline} \"Military plans always \... unfortunately, work on
the basis of making the worst scenario assumptions on the basis of
capabilities rather than ... intentions. And the problem with that is
the old security dilemma that you ... \[end up increasing\] your
insecurity; say, you think \[that\] by having more troops or putting
them closer to the enemy ... or to \[a\] potential adversary \[that you
will be safer\] ... \[but\] the potential adversary feels their security
upset,\" he explained. But Agnia Grigas, a senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council, a Washington DC-based think-tank, said that while Russia is
unlikely to resort to direct aggression, it does not mean that these
countries are not at risk. \"Russia could resort to fomenting
separatists, training local radicals or militants, sending its own
activists and volunteers over the border. Potential conflicts could
spill over the border so Russia\'s frontier states are right to bolster
their defences when the security environment in Europe has been
transformed,\" Grigas told Al Jazeera. [The Russian
president]{.underline}, however, [has insisted that he has no intention
of attacking a NATO member country. \"I think that only an insane person
and only in a dream can imagine that Russia would suddenly attack
NATO,\" Vladimir Putin said]{.underline} last June. Putin also said that
the increase in Russian drills was in response to NATO increasing its
activity in the region and questioned why the latter wasn\'t perceived
as aggressive behaviour on the part of NATO. \"A missile defence system
is being deployed under the far-fetched pretext of countering the
Iranian nuclear threat after this threat has been eliminated and a
treaty with Iran has been signed \... Next comes an announcement that
NATO\'s force in the Baltic countries will be enlarged,\" Putin said
during a a press conference. Cold war, hot war or neither? During the
Munich Security Conference in February, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry
Medvedev said: \"We have slid back to a new Cold War.\" But not everyone
agrees. In February, Ilves said it is less a cold war than a hot war
that is taking place in Europe. \"I\'d rather have a cold war in that
case, because during the Cold War we weren\'t having live fire on a
daily basis, which we have today \[in Ukraine\],\" he said. But
[Duncan]{.underline} told Al Jazeera that he [does not think a Cold War
is approaching]{.underline}. \"With the rise of China, in particular,
and to a much lesser extent India, Brazil and so on, [international
relations are very different]{.underline} \[to how they were during the
Cold War\]. [The hostility between Russia and the West is not something
that threatens the existence of either party. Russia certainly doesn\'t
want to cause unnecessary problems for the West; rather the Russian
economy depends on a prosperous Western European economy.\"]{.underline}

#### Russia doesn't want to challenge US leadership. 

**NATO**, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 2/4/**19**

( <https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50090.htm>)

For more than two decades, [NATO has worked to build a partnership with
Russia, developing dialogue and practical cooperation in areas of common
interest]{.underline}. Cooperation has been suspended since 2014 in
response to Russia's military intervention in Ukraine but political and
military channels of communication remain open. Concerns about Russia's
continued destabilising pattern of military activities and aggressive
rhetoric go well beyond Ukraine. After Russia's illegal and illegitimate
annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the Allies suspended all practical
civilian and military cooperation in April 2014, while keeping open
channels of political and military communication. The [NATO-Russia
Council (NRC) remains an important forum for dialogue, on the basis of
reciprocity, and has met nine times since 2016.]{.underline} At the NATO
Summit in Wales in September 2014 and at successive summits since then,
Allied leaders have condemned in the strongest terms Russia's military
intervention in Ukraine, calling on Russia to stop and withdraw its
forces from Ukraine and along the country's border. Allies continue to
demand that Russia comply with international law and its international
obligations and responsibilities; end its illegitimate occupation of
Crimea; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow
of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the
separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian
border. NATO does not and will not recognise Russia\'s illegal and
illegitimate annexation of Crimea. The Allies have also noted that
violence and insecurity in the region led to the tragic downing of
Malaysia Airlines passenger flight MH17 on 17 July 2014, calling for
those directly and indirectly responsible to be held accountable and
brought to justice as soon as possible. In May 2018, the Joint
Investigation Team, which is investigating the MH17 crash, concluded
that the BUK-TELAR that was used to down the aircraft originated from
the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian army from
Kursk. Allies stand in solidarity with the Netherlands and Australia,
which call on Russia to take State responsibility for the downing of
flight MH17. Allies [strongly support the settlement of the conflict in
eastern Ukraine by diplomatic and peaceful means and welcome the ongoing
diplomatic efforts to this end. All signatories of the Minsk Agreements
must comply with their commitments and ensure their full implementation.
Russia has a significant responsibility in this regard]{.underline}.

### AT: Burden On US 

#### Trump's budgetary arguments are a load of lies 

**Chiampan,** PhD, **02-19** (Andrea, Postdoctorate Fellow at Swiss
National Science Foundation (SNSF), "Trump and the Future of NATO,"
Current Affairs in Perspective, p. 7)//EF

[In November 2016, the people of the United States elected a
president---Donald Trump---who does not recognize not only the value of
NATO as an organization---which he has defined "obsolete"---but also the
value of the transatlantic economic, political, and military partnership
as a whole as well as the international liberal order it
promotes.]{.underline} In fact, Trump challenged that global order that
the United States engineered and endured to maintain for over 70
years.13 Once in office, European defense spending and EU exports have
become Trump's focus of attention. These two grievances seem to be
somehow connected in Trump's world view. [Trump accused European nations
to free-ride on their security at great cost for the United States while
at the same time enjoying the prosperity that derives from the trade
surplus the EU maintains on the United States.]{.underline} "We are
spending a fortune on military in order to lose \$800 billion in trade
losses. That doesn\'t sound very smart to me," the president said in a
completely misleading characterization of US trade deficit.14 Trump went
as far as to call the European Union a "foe" for "what they do to us is
in trade."15 The US and the EU came close to a trade war as the
administration imposed high tariffs on European steel and aluminum and
even ventilated that it might do the same on automobiles. To this, the
EU responded with increased tariffs on some American goods, including
Harley-Davidson motorcycles.16 Trump also pointed his finger at
Germany's economic relations with Russia on energy matters[. In
particular, Trump criticized the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that is
due to increase gas streams to Germany and Western Europe but bypass
Eastern European countries. "They want us to protect them against
Russia, and yet they pay billions of dollars to Russia, and we\'re the
schmucks paying for the whole thing," the president boasted.17 Trump's
attacks on trade went hand in hand with complaints about NATO-Europe's
deficient military spending \[Fig. 1\]. Trump like many presidents
before him would like for the allies to spend more on defense, but his
hostile rhetoric is unprecedented.]{.underline} "They've really taken
advantage of us, and many of those countries are in NATO and they
weren't paying their bills."18 In order to fuel this idea President
Trump portrayed NATO as having some sort of a single, collective, and
comprehensive defense budget to which every member contributes, which is
incorrect. [He even went as far as arguing that Germany "owes vast sums
of money to NATO, and the United States must be paid more for the
powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides."19 However, this is
not how NATO budget works. **Direct financial contributions to NATO
budget by member countries are set in accordance with an agreed
cost-sharing formula based on Gross National Income
(GNI).**]{.underline} This form of common funding is the only kind of
contribution that members are required to pour into NATO. For 2017,
NATO's total budget was roughly \$2.44 billion. This comprised: a) civil
budget for \$262 million, which provides funds for personnel expenses,
operating costs, and capital and programmed expenditure of the
International Staff at NATO Headquarters; b) a military budget,
amounting to \$1.44 billion, which covers the operating and maintenance
costs of the NATO Command Structure (essentially the international
military staff and the different strategic commands, and military
committees); c) and finally, the NATO Security Investment Program, for a
maximum of \$734 million, which is to provide major construction and
command and control system investments, installations and facilities and
so on.20 [In this sense, every NATO member country owes a predetermined
share that makes up NATO budget and all countries have regularly paid
these mandatory contributions. The US paid \$540.32 million, Germany
\$357.46, France \$259.46 and Britain \$240.3 million. This also means
that on a per capita basis Americans are paying far less than Germans,
roughly \$1.68 per person for the 2017 NATO budget as opposed to
\$4.39.21 Of course, the commonly funded budget does not include the
cost of actually running operations, that is to say the money spent on
soldiers, weapons, equipment and other capabilities of each individual
country. These are commonly known as indirect costs, but these are
entirely up to national states to decide and are not part of NATO budget
per se**. When the North Atlantic Council (NAC) unanimously decides to
engage in an operation, there is no obligation for each and every
country to contribute to the operation unless it falls under Article V.
In all cases, contributions are voluntary and vary in form and scale.
These voluntary contributions are offered by individual allies and are
taken from their overall defense capability to form the combined
Alliance capability.**]{.underline} [But even considering these costs,
Trump's allegation that the US covers "anywhere between 70 and 90
percent" of all NATO costs is blatantly incorrect. It is hard to know
where Trump learned this information, but he seems to refer to the fact
that the US spends 67% in real terms of what NATO nations combined spend
on defense, this amounts to 3.5% circa of its GDP.]{.underline}
Clearly[, this does not mean that the US covers over 67% of the costs
involved in the operational running of NATO as an organization. This
simply means that the US spends more than any other NATO member on its
own defense, which is entirely unsurprising given the fact that **the US
is the wealthiest nation in the world, the world's only superpower, and
its military performs a global role.**]{.underline}22 Put simply, saying
that the US spends \$600 billion on defense is not the same as saying
that the US spends \$600 billion to defend Europe from Russia or to run
NATO military operations. As one NATO official simply put it, "Because
the US has this global reach and global responsibility then of course
the military defense expenditures are going to be very different from a
country like Slovenia or Luxembourg."23 There is another possible
interpretation to Trump's accusation that Germany (and others) "owe"
money to the United States. Trump might be referring to the fact that
Germany like many other countries in Europe (as well as Canada) have not
yet met a pledge agreed by Ministers in a North Atlantic Council meeting
in Wales back in 2014 according to which NATO member states should
increase their defense spending to 2% of their GDP.24 However, the 2%
pledge was always intended simply as a political guideline and, at any
rate, it was to be reached by 2024---not 2018 \[Fig.2\]. Furthermore,
these increases could not in any way be considered part of the members'
financial obligations and they would only indirectly improve NATO
defense capabilities.

## AT Disads 

### AT German Leadership -- Not Possible 

#### Germany can barely keep up with its own domestic issues 

**The Economist, 02-07-19** ("It is time to worry about Germany's
economy,"
<https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/02/07/it-is-time-to-worry-about-germanys-economy)//EF>

[The world is used to a thriving German economy.]{.underline} A decade
ago, during the financial crisis, it shed relatively few jobs, as
unemployment soared elsewhere. [Since then it has been an anchor of
fiscal stability while much of the euro zone has struggled with debt and
deficits]{.underline}. Its public debt is below the target of 60% of gdp
set by eu treaties---and falling. Thanks to labour-market reforms
introduced during the 2000s, Germans enjoy levels of employment that
beat job-friendly Britain, even as inequality is barely higher than in
France. Its geographically dispersed manufacturing industries, made up
of about 200,000 small and medium-sized firms, have mitigated the
regional disparities that have fuelled populism across the West (see
article). [Yet the German economy suddenly looks vulnerable. In the
short term it faces a slowdown]{.underline}. [It only narrowly
avoided]{.underline} a [recession at the end of 2018.]{.underline}
Temporary factors, such as [tighter emissions standards for cars,
explain some of the weakness]{.underline}, but there is little sign of a
bounceback. Manufacturing output probably fell in January. [Businesses
are losing confidence. Both the imf and the finance ministry have
slashed growth forecasts for 2019]{.underline} (see article). [In the
longer term, changing patterns of trade and technology are moving
against Germany's world-beating manufacturers.]{.underline} In response,
on February 5th Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, laid out plans to
block unwanted foreign takeovers and to promote national and European
champions.

#### Germany's *[international prominence]{.underline}* is *[fading]{.underline}* alongside its *[wrecked economy]{.underline}* 

**Mody**, Economics visiting professor at Charles and Marie Robertson,
**18** ("Germany's Economy Will Be Europe's Problem,"
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-07/germany-s-economy-will-be-europe-s-problem)//EF>

[The imminent end of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's final term
presents a great challenge for both her country and the entire European
project]{.underline}. [If her successor can't pull the]{.underline}
German [economy out of its slide toward second-tier status]{.underline},
[the union could lose its most important financial
supporter.]{.underline} Since Merkel's announcement that she will not
seek another term in 2021[, the focus has been on whether her successor
will be]{.underline} more [willing to engage in the kind of risk-sharing
needed to make the euro a viable currency]{.underline} --- meaning a
more complete banking union and more fiscal support for struggling
member countries. Friedrich Merz, a leading contender to replace Merkel,
has implied he might try, though he remains skeptical of "old French
ideas" for financing deeper integration. [Yet even if Germany's next
leader can summon the political will, there's another obstacle: a
diminishing economy, which threatens to undermine the confidence Germans
need to play a more proactive role. Besieged on multiple fronts, the
country is struggling to deliver higher standards of
living.]{.underline} For nearly half the population, incomes haven't
risen in a generation. [The warning signs flashed in Merkel's first
term]{.underline}. German companies, for example, had long excelled in
innovation, as measured by the number of patents registered in the U.S.
But by 2007, Korean companies had caught up. They now register nearly
double the number that their German counterparts do, thanks to huge
investments in education and research. China, too, has been gaining
ground, joining Korea in staking a claim to global technological
leadership. Merkel understood the challenge. In 2010, she promised a big
push on investment in education and research. She invoked Europe's Age
of Enlightenment in the 17th century, when dazzling intellectual
progress placed Europeans at the frontier of human knowledge. She
recognized that Chinese leaders were making a concerted bid to return to
the heyday that Chinese science enjoyed in the 10th century. But Germany
fell short. As of 2015, Korean and Chinese high-school students were
outperforming their German counterparts in science and, especially, in
mathematics. While Korean universities have not securely established
themselves in the top echelons, the two best Chinese universities rank
higher than the best German universities. Indeed, measured by how often
their science and technology research is cited, Chinese universities
occupy the top two spots globally and four more of the top 15. No
European institution is even on that elite list. [The automotive
industry exemplifies how Germany is losing its edge]{.underline}. The
country has long enjoyed a formidable reputation for quality,
performance and style. But that might be changing. In an ever-enlarging
scandal, [American and European regulators have caught German companies
cheating on emission standards in their diesel cars.]{.underline} As
they scramble to meet the standards, the country's automakers are facing
a broader regulatory transformation, with municipal authorities banning
cars in city centers. Meanwhile, as electric replaces internal
combustion, German manufacturers remain deeply rooted in the old diesel
technology. Merkel and her government have sought to ease their pain by
delaying tougher emission standards and deferring bans on car use, but
this is a losing battle. Germans place a premium on cleaner air. [The
transition to electric cars will render the technologies used by
automakers and their suppliers largely obsolete, causing wide-ranging
disruption.]{.underline} There's more. Germany's fabled banks have
served the country's small and medium-size firms well. But the banks
suffer from chronically low profitability --- particularly in the
network of quasi-public institutions, the Sparkassen and Landesbanken,
typically owned or controlled by municipalities and state governments.
In 2001, the European Commission pronounced that the Landesbanken were
receiving unfair subsidies. [As they lost access to the subsidies, the
Landesbanken gambled for redemption in the U.S. subprime market and
other risky ventures. Predictably, they bled profusely. Perhaps
Germany's greatest weakness is Deutsche Bank, whose stock price is still
less than a tenth of where in stood in May 2007, ahead of the subprime
crisis]{.underline}. In recent years, U.S. and British regulators have
fined the bank hundreds of millions of dollars for improper
representations and possible money laundering. It's currently under
separate investigations for assisting criminals and Denmark's Danske
Bank in laundering large sums of money. [Its business model
is]{.underline} evidently [not working]{.underline}. [If it falters, its
size and global systemic connections could place a substantial burden on
the government]{.underline}. Ideas propel a modern economy. Yet
Germany's farthest-reaching economic policy of the past generation, the
labor reforms of Gerhard Schröder, reduced incentives to invest in human
capital by making it easier to fire employees. Workers became
expendable, inequality increased and the sense of insecurity spread.
[Climbing the economic ladder became harder.]{.underline} Many
discouraged Germans turned to the euroskeptic, anti-immigration
Alternative für Deutschland party. A growing rebellion within Merkel's
Christian Democrats eroded her authority. These deepening political
fault lines delivered a fragmented German Bundestag in the 2017 federal
elections, placing Germany's vaunted political stability at risk.
Germany must shed its narrow reliance on engineering excellence and bank
funding, and move toward a more flexible structure where emergent
technologies can flourish. This primarily requires the scale of
investment in education and curriculum modernization that Merkel hinted
at but did not deliver. Education is twice blessed: It fosters growth
and gives hope to those left behind. The government must also
consolidate the Sparkassen and Landesbanken into two or three banks,
while severing their subsidies. And if Deutsche Bank is not cleaned up
and downsized, it will surely become a public liability. Economic
historian Charles Kindleberger described a hegemonic power as one that
makes short-term financial sacrifices to aid other countries, believing
that prosperity elsewhere comes around to benefit it. [Germany is in the
last phase of its global prominence, a nation unwittingly sliding into
the ranks of also-rans. The question is whether it's too set in its
ways, with too many vested interests, to change course.]{.underline} The
task for the next chancellor is clear: Reinvigorate the economy. Only
then will Germans show a willingness to do more for Europe.

### AT German Leadership -- Not Good

#### Germany has *[way too many domestic problems]{.underline}* -- Merkel screwed them over -- German leadership also ruins Europe 

**O\'Sullivan**, Writer for the National Review, **16** (John, Germany
Can Do Better than Angela Merkel, National Review,
https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/09/angela-merkel-legacy-incompetent-leadership-germany-europe/,
9-24-2016)//EF

[Despite her reputation for competence, Merkel has led her country (and
Europe) into one crisis after another.]{.underline} 'The graveyards are
full of indispensable men," said De Gaulle, or his predecessor Georges
Clemenceau, or New York publisher Elbert Hubbard, or one of several
other less famous people with a good turn of phrase, according to the
scrupulously careful online Quote Investigator. Be that as it may, it's
looking increasingly likely that the (political) graveyard will soon be
welcoming an "indispensable" woman, recently sanctified as such on the
cover of The Economist, namely German chancellor Angela Merkel. Her
Christian Democrat party fell to third place in Berlin's local elections
last week and may not stay long in the city's governing coalition. Two
thirds of German voters now want her gone. And the names of successors
are being freely canvassed. This decline and the associated rise of the
right-wing Alternative for Germany party are being blamed on Merkel's
unqualified invitation to Syrian refugees to come to Germany last year.
[More than 1 million migrants have done so in the intervening twelve
months]{.underline} --- many of them neither Syrian nor refugees --- and
[they have led to a large rise in violent and "hate"
crimes]{.underline}, some committed by them, some by those protesting
their arrival. These things are frightening not only the voters, but
also nervous members of Merkel's own parliamentary party devoted to
their own careers before hers. For them, the writing is on the Berlin
Wall. Even those drafting her advance obituaries, however, seem to
regard her tenure as chancellor as having been an overall success marked
by prudence and achievement. She is generally still seen as "a safe pair
of hands" --- and indeed the best election poster for the CDU last time
was a simple picture of a pair of hands. You can make that case --- I'll
do so in a moment as a kind of exercise --- but only on grounds that
would alarm her admirers and threaten her reputation. [By any
respectable criterion, she is a klutz on a heroic scale.]{.underline}
[Consider the following examples: Merkel's energy policy was based upon
a combination of nuclear power and "renewables" in order to close down
power stations dependent on fossil fuels, and help Germany lead the
European Union and the world toward a carbon-free future]{.underline}.
She had been a strong defender of nuclear energy against SPD chancellor
Gerhard Schröder's attempts to phase it out. Within a few weeks of the
Japanese nuclear disaster at Fukushima, though, she panicked, reversed
herself, and closed down Germany's entire nuclear program. [Her
Energiewende since then has led to a massive increase in power bills for
consumers and industry]{.underline}, the movement abroad of German
companies heavily reliant on energy, and, more recently, a phasing out
of the phasing out of coal-fired power stations. Merkel and the nuclear
companies are still haggling over how much the German government will
pay for the estimated €23 billion cost of shutting down their plants.
[Meanwhile, no one believes that Germany and Europe will meet their
official goal of reducing carbon emissions 80-95 percent from their 1990
levels by the year 2050]{.underline}. The refugee crisis is all too
plainly a vast mistake, as Merkel herself has admitted. But some of its
side-effects have produced other crises almost as severe. Example one:
though Merkel welcomed "Syrian refugees" without consulting even her
colleagues in the German government, she immediately demanded that other
European states within the then-borderless Schengen Zone should accept
them as well. That demand was resisted (and still is) by other
governments, and there's been a long-running "existential" (Jean-Claude
Juncker's word, not mine) crisis in the EU ever since. Example two:
Merkel reduced the flow of Middle Eastern migrants into the EU through a
deal with Turkish strongman Recep Tayyik Erdogan to control the border.
But the price was high: the EU's silence over Erdogan's arbitrary arrest
of thousands of soldiers, police, lawyers, and journalists, and
visa-free entry into the EU for 80 million Turks, which could mean
another migrant crisis down the road. There's no guarantee that Erdogan
--- who's skilled at selling the same horse twice --- won't ask for
additional concessions from a desperate Merkel and EU, either. Whether
Brexit is a good idea for Britain --- as I think it is --- Merkel and
her EU colleagues all devoutly believe that it's bad for Europe. But she
helped to create the circumstances that made it happen by rejecting all
of PM David Cameron's demands except for the most trivial --- and even
then the concessions the EU offered were legally reversible. It was a
serious setback for her and for her lodestar of European unity. And it
came about because at a time when populist parties were rising
throughout Europe, including the AFD in Germany, she complacently
assumed that the risk of Brexit was not a serious one. She had
confidence that Cameron would win but gave him no real help in doing so.
He resigned; she was further weakened. When Merkel won her first
election in 2004, she represented a more general shift to the liberal
economic right in German politics. Chancellor Schröder --- the SPD
leader she narrowly defeated --- had ushered in some market-friendly
economic reforms that many now credit for making the German economy more
dynamic. Indeed, Merkel herself praised him for doing so. Since then,
however, she has presided over a shift back to the Left. By blocking the
demands of the CDU's traditional coalition partner, the Free Democrats,
for tax cuts and a more market-friendly approach, she made them look
weak and ineffective. As a result, they fell below the 5 percent
threshold for entry into the Bundestag for the first time since 1945.
Though the 2013 election was generally reported as a victory for Merkel
and the CDU, in fact it ushered in a small parliamentary majority for
the Left. That had consequences. [To retain the coalition and her
chancellorship, Merkel had to agree to a series of small socialist
reforms required by the SPD --- notably, a quite generous minimum wage
and a reduction in the pension age. Judged by results, Merkel looks more
and more East German with every passing election.]{.underline}
(Incidentally, the Free Democrats now favor some restrictions on
immigration.) Merkel's Euro policy has proved --- astounding though it
sounds --- even more destructive than her immigration policy. [By
insisting that Germany had to prove its loyalty to Europe by ruling out
any reform of the Euro's structure, she imprisoned Southern European
countries in an over-valued exchange rate that inflicted recession,
unemployment, and a debt crisis on them indefinitely]{.underline}. It's
hard to express the damage this has done to millions of human lives, but
here's one measure: Though the average unemployment rate for the
Eurozone hovered between 10 and 12 percent from 2010 to 2016 and the
Eurozone youth-unemployment rate hovered between 20 and 22 percent over
the same period, the youth-unemployment rate in Mediterranean Europe has
generally been around the 50 percent mark. (There have been
corresponding problems for northern Europe in the subsidies their
taxpayers have had to pay to keep Greece, Spain, and Portugal solvent
and inside the straitjacket.) [Political instability has accordingly
flourished in the South, with successive governments losing elections
and extreme Marxist parties coming to or near power. Relations between
different European countries --- above all, Greece and Germany --- have
been permanently poisoned. Democracy itself has been sidelined by
Brussels as it replaced elected prime ministers with its own favored
technocrats. In short, nothing has damaged European unity more than
Merkel's blindly unreasoning insistence on an un-reformed
Euro.]{.underline}

### AT German Economy -- Alt Causes

#### Alt causes to German economic decline

**Jolly**, financial reporter for the Guardian, **19** (Jasper,

[German exports and industrial output fell sharply in April,
triggering]{.underline} fresh [fears that trade tensions and [continued
Brexit
uncertainty](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/06/no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-uk-economy-into-recession-oecd)
are weighing on the global growth outlook. Industrial
production]{.underline} in Europe's largest economy [fell
1.9%,]{.underline} [which was the worst monthly fall in almost four
years]{.underline}, according to Germany's statistics office. [It was
much worse than the 0.4% decline forecast by economists. Exports fell by
3.7% in April compared with the previous month, while imports also fell.
German industry]{.underline}, the powerhouse of the European economy,
[has suffered in the past year as trade tensions between the US and
China have put the brakes on]{.underline} global trade growth. [The
German car sector,]{.underline} a major exporter, has also [been hit by
a decline in demand for vehicles in the EU and China]{.underline}. The
[export fall]{.underline} in April was in part [driven by a sharp
8.7%]{.underline} year-on-year [fall in exports to the EU's non-eurozone
economies]{.underline} -- the largest of which is the UK. [Exports to
the UK fell by €1.6bn]{.underline} (£1.4bn) [in April compared to the
previous year]{.underline}, to €5.6bn -- a [22% year-on-year
fall](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Wirtschaft/Aussenhandel/Tabellen/aussenhandel-detaildaten.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=8).
"This is [a horrible start to the second quarter for German industry, as
global trade tensions]{.underline} [as well]{.underline} as temporary
[problems in the automotive sector and chemical industry have left their
marks]{.underline}," said Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist in
[Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany) for the Dutch bank
ING. [Germany's Bundesbank]{.underline} on Friday sharply [downgraded
its growth forecasts for this year]{.underline} and next in response to
the signs of a slowdown. Economists at the central bank expect German
GDP to rise by only 0.6% this year, down from the 1.6% predicted back in
December.

come back with a vengeance for the industrial sector,\" Oxford Economics
analyst Ángel Talavera told his clients. \"[The]{.underline} shocking
[plunge in]{.underline} the [German manufacturing index to its lowest
since 2012 is a]{.underline} stark [reminder that the outlook for the
industrial sector continues to be dominated by uncertainty, overwhelmed
by a multitude of potential negative shocks ranging from a hard Brexit
to the imposition of tariffs by the US.\"]{.underline} PMI refers to the
\"purchasing managers\' index.\" Although manufacturing in Germany
isn\'t as large as its services sector, which remains buoyant, the
country is psychologically identified with its historic manufacturing
prowess. Think BMW, VW, Audi, BASF, and Bayer. [Germany is also the
largest economy in Europe. It sits at the heart of the eurozone currency
area, and its largest non-European trading partners are China and the
US.]{.underline} It is also the fourth largest economy globally. [If
German manufacturing sneezes, everyone else can catch a
cold,]{.underline} in other words. \"The gap between the services and
the manufacturing PMIs has now risen to levels not seen since the global
financial crisis,\" Talavera also wrote, in a note seen by Business
Insider.

off the 2% target NATO members have set themselves. However, [the

#### Past legislation proves support for a strong US role in NATO is bipartisan in Congress

**Killough & Siegel**, producer for CNN covering Congress; producer for
CNN, **19** (Ashley & David, 01.22.19, "House passes NATO bill to send a
strong message to Trump,"
<https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/politics/nato-house-vote/index.html)> np

(CNN) [The]{.underline} Democratic-controlled [House approved a
bill]{.underline} Tuesday [that would reiterate strong congressional
support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline} alliance
[amid]{.underline} recent [[reports that President Donald Trump raised
the
idea]{.underline}](http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/15/politics/trump-nato-us-withdraw/index.html)
[of withdrawing from NATO several times l]{.underline}ast year. \"It\'s
so disturbing \-- troubling to see the United States sending mixed
signals about our commitment to the alliance, or treating it as a
burden,\" said House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, a New York
Democrat, at a news conference on Capitol Hill. \"You know what a burden
would be?\" he asked. \"A burden would be for the United States to try
and conduct foreign policy without allies, without 28 other countries
that share our values and have fought alongside American troops, sharing
the burden of lost blood and treasure at times.\" Trump has been clear
in his criticism of NATO and has knocked allies for [failing to pay
enough for their
defense](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/politics/nato-funding-explainer/index.html).
Meanwhile, Russia has long attempted to divide the alliance, and a US
exit would be seen as a major victory for Russian President Vladimir
Putin. [The bill, which passed with bipartisan support by 357-22, states
that it\'s US policy to remain a member of NATO and prohibits funds from
being used to withdraw from the alliance. Last year, the Republican-led
Senate approved a motion of support for NATO]{.underline} the same day
that Trump arrived in Brussels, Belgium, for a NATO summit. [And a
bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that would require Senate
approval for the US to withdraw from NATO.]{.underline} Backers of the
House bill argue it would continue to put pressure on NATO allies to
increase their defense budgets as they have pledged to do. [Democratic
Rep.]{.underline} Jimmy [Panetta]{.underline} of California [said
leaving NATO would be a \"historic mistake.\"]{.underline} \"Because
what we have to realize that is NATO is not just a transactional
relationship,\" he said. \"Our sole focus can\'t just be on who pays
what and who gets what. Being a member of NATO is not like being a
member of a country club.\" Rep. Tom Malinowski, a former assistant
secretary at the State Department, said the bill prohibits funds from
being used to pay for a US departure or to cover expenses like moving
troops in what he described as \"an enormous undertaking\" after a
decades-long footprint in the alliance. \"You bet you it would cost a
lot of money, and we have the power of the purse,\" the New Jersey
Democrat said. \"It is, in a sense, crazy that we have to be doing this,
but we have to be doing this,\" Malinowski added. \"It is both necessary
and urgent.\" \"What we are saying here is that we are not leaving NATO
without a struggle from the United States Congress,\" he said.

As November draws closer, the [shots volleyed from Donald Trump's
campaign continue to cause anxiety for NATO's European
allies.]{.underline} Though Trump has tried to dial back his rhetoric,
his initial comments that NATO is
"[obsolete](https://www.ft.com/content/0f397616-f9b8-11e5-8e04-8600cef2ca75)"
and contending that he would have no problem seeing it "[break
up](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/02/donald-trump-tells-crowd-hed-be-fine-if-nato-broke-up/?_r=0)"
have NATO partners fretting about the future of the U.S. commitment.
There is hope that institutions and agreements can weather the building
storm, but Trump's apparent disregard for the Euroatlantic pillar of the
U.S. global security posture could have wide ranging implications.
Combined with the power of the president to set the U.S. foreign policy
agenda, it is not hard to imagine how U.S. engagement in Europe (and
around the globe) could significantly change. No one really knows where
Trump's policy will end up, but his statements about U.S. allies and the
NATO Alliance should be taken at face value. Extremes of rhetoric aside,
[the grievances about burden sharing and the U.S. role abroad are
real.]{.underline} European allies must not dismiss the chord that this
year's electoral politics have struck with segments of the U.S.
population. Following the combat mission in Afghanistan, war in Iraq,
and the financial crisis in 2008, there is limited appetite for
conversations encouraging U.S. global responsibility and global
commitments. [The U.S. presidential campaign has shown that candidates
are rewarded by focusing attention inward at policies that try to shut
out or isolate global realities]{.underline} (trade, foreign policy, et
al.). [A Pew Research Center Poll earlier this year showed that a
majority of Americans are simply [wary of global
engagement](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/05/key-findings-on-how-americans-view-the-u-s-role-in-the-world/).]{.underline}
The NATO Alliance has seemingly been swept up in this weariness of a
global role. [However, public opinion clearly differentiates between a
hesitancy of global engagement and the importance of a long-held
alliance like NATO]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} same [Pew Research
Survey [found that
77%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/05/key-findings-on-how-americans-view-the-u-s-role-in-the-world/)
of the American public believes that membership in NATO is a good
thing,]{.underline} and even [among Trump's targeted Republican base,
[only 30%
claimed](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/06/support-for-nato-is-widespread-among-member-nations/)
that NATO is bad]{.underline} for the United States. [[A majority of
respondents](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/1-nato-public-opinion-wary-of-russia-leary-of-action-on-ukraine/)
in a 2015 survey took their support further, indicating that the United
States should confront Russia with military force if it attacked a NATO
ally]{.underline} -- reinforcing their support of Article V. While
globalization-wary rhetoric may be active in the campaign, its specific
application to NATO is less convincing. That said, it is certainly
possible that contagion could affect NATO more as it continues. U.S.
criticisms of Euroatlantic partners' defense and security efforts are,
of course, not new. In the late 1990s, U.S. Senator John McCain warned
about the [erosion of American popular support for
NATO](http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=513b4a8a-7e6a-4bd7-a0e1-4dd9f54df22c)
if it did not improve its burden sharing. Recently, President Obama
bluntly called some of America's European partners "[free
riders](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/)."
Even talking about the bipartisan habit of complaining about European
defense spending levels and burden sharing in NATO is cliché at this
point. If anything is to be taken from the current discourse in U.S.
campaign politics, it is that [future U.S. administrations, as well as
the American public, are likely to only expect more from U.S. allies and
partners.]{.underline} This is particularly true for those who are both
economically capable and "nearer to the threat." If Europe is able to
continue a trend of increasing defense spending and assuming greater
leadership in the region, it will go a long way in assuaging U.S.
concerns about shouldering too much of the burden, or at least begin to
remove that long-standing element from the discourse.

#### Majority of voter support NATO

Celebrations of the 70th anniversary of NATO on April 4 may be clouded
by concerns about statements by Donald Trump questioning the US
commitment to NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, [a
new survey finds that 83% of American voters favor the US continuing to
be part of NATO, including 90% of Democrats, but also 77% of Republicans
and 76% of those who voted for Trump. The survey of 2,416 registered
voters was conducted by the Program for Public Consultation (PPC) at the
University of Maryland]{.underline}, and released today by the
nonpartisan organization Voice of the People. [Concerns about the US
commitment to NATO have been sparked by Donald Trump's characterization
of NATO as "obsolete,]{.underline}" and his statements that he might
consider withdrawing the US from NATO if other NATO members do not
increase their military spending. Respondents were informed about the
controversy stemming from US pressure to get European NATO allies to
spend more on their militaries. While the European allies have agreed to
raise their spending to two percent of GDP, many have failed to do so.
Presented three options, only 12% endorsed pressing European allies "to
spend more on their military and say that if they do not the US will
disengage from Europe militarily and possibly withdraw from NATO"---21%
of Republicans, 4% of Democrats. Thirty-five percent favored pressing
the Europeans but not making threats. The most popular idea---supported
by 50% was to "remain part of NATO but reduce US military investments in
Europe to bring them more in line with the level that the Europeans
make" (Republicans 47%, Democrats 50%). ["Only a small minority of
Americans show interest in withdrawing from NATO or using the threat to
do so as a source of leverage," c]{.underline}ommented Steven Kull,
director of PPC. To ensure that respondents understood the issue, they
were first given a short briefing on NATO including the commitment to
defend any ally that comes under attack. The content was reviewed by
experts on the issues to ensure the briefing was accurate and balanced,
and the strongest arguments were presented. Respondents were then asked
to evaluate arguments for and against remaining in NATO. [The arguments
in favor of remaining were found convincing by very large majorities.
These included the argument that Russia is still a potential threat to
Europe and it is in the US' interest to help Europe contain them (85%
found this convincing), as well as the argument that NATO is a useful
symbol for each country's commitment to freedom and democracy, and a
necessary tool to ensure the continuation of free and open trade (82%
convincing). Large majorities of both parties found these arguments
convincing, though Democrats had larger numbers (89% in both cases) than
Republicans (82%, 75% respectively).]{.underline} Far fewer -- no more
than four in ten -- found the arguments against remaining in NATO
convincing. They included the argument that Russia is not a real threat
and US security commitments enable countries to be unnecessarily
provocative (40%), as well as the argument that having a military
alliance targeted clearly at Russia violates the post-Cold War
understanding between the US and Russia, and is therefore destabilizing
(35%). Republicans were more likely to find these arguments convincing
(51% and 42%) than Democrats (28% for both).

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.

word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,

#### Moots negative ground- the US is the world's most powerful actor and can resolve most impacts through adding planks to the plan

#### infinite regress- if we read a disad to the intrinsicness argument they can kick it at no cost or make a new intrinsicness argument to solve the disad- they get the last speech denying us a chance to respond to their final advocacy

#### Counter interpretation: the aff gets *topical* intrinsicness arguemnts-this solves their offense but still requires the aff to win by justifying the resolution. 

#### Trump will leak that the perm was a lie

President [Trump's staff has learned a hard lesson]{.underline}. [If the
president says something in private]{.underline}, no matter how
geopolitically fraught, [it\'s only a matter of time before he blurts it
out in public.]{.underline} Between the lines: [Trump's [Wall Street
Journal
interview](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-revokes-ex-cia-director-john-brennans-security-clearance-1534358658)
this week is just the latest example of this habit.]{.underline} In that
interview, [he contradicted the White House\'s]{.underline} official
[narrative by saying he had revoked]{.underline} John [Brennan's
security clearance]{.underline} because of the Russia probe. [It\'s far
from the first time Trump has publicly blurted out something that his
aides privately implored him to keep under wraps.]{.underline} Behind
the scenes: A source who\'s spent hours with Trump in confidential White
House settings told me the Journal interview brought back bad memories.
[Not only of Trump\'s]{.underline}
[[interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/i-was-going-to-fire-comey-anyway-trump-tells-lester-holt-in-interview-941538371971?v=railb)
last year with NBC\'s Lester Holt --- when the president admitted \"this
Russia thing with Trump\" was on his mind when he fired then-FBI
director James Comey --- but of other times when Trump blurted out
thoughts he\'d previously expressed in private that his national
security team hoped would stay that way.]{.underline} The two examples
the source gave: In a private meeting last summer, Trump asked senior
national security aides, including then-national security adviser H.R.
McMaster, what would happen if the U.S. invaded Venezuela. The aides
warned Trump against the idea, but he ended up blurting out publicly
that he wasn\'t ruling out a \"military option\" in Venezuela. (The
AP[first
reported](https://www.apnews.com/a3309c4990ac4581834d4a654f7746ef/Trump-pressed-aides-on-Venezuela-invasion,-US-official-says)
Trump\'s private comments.) For weeks earlier this year, Trump had been
telling national security officials that Syria was a disaster and he
wanted to withdraw U.S. troops ASAP. His aides, including Chief of Staff
John Kelly, privately urged him not to say anything. When Trump traveled
to Ohio for an infrastructure event in March, the text of his speech
said nothing about foreign policy, according to a source with direct
knowledge of the remarks. But Trump got up on stage and [blurted
out](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-john-kelly-syria-remark-off-script-367efe03-b0d3-493d-8805-411bf28bde85.html)
that the U.S. would be \"coming out of Syria, like, very soon.\" The
bottom line: [Trump\'s aides have learned the hard way that once they
hear the president say something privately --- no matter how harmful it
might be --- it\'s only a matter of time before he blurts it out
publicly.]{.underline} \"When something is on his mind, everybody will
know it soon,\" the source told me. \"The only thing you can do is once
you hear him say something privately, start preparing talking points
because sooner or later you will hear it in public.\"

#### Lying is immoral and must be on face rejected 

**Murphy 96 \<**Mark C., 41 Am. J. Juris. 81, The American Journal of
Jurisprudence, "Natural Law And The Moral Absolute Against Lying,"
lexis\>

Bok\'s remarks capture the insight that what disturbs people about lying
is not fundamentally that lies are contrary to the good of knowledge,
though [lies certainly are contrary to that good]{.underline}. What is
most troubling about being lied to is that [lies infect the
decisionmaking process, undermining the good of practical
reasonableness. Thus, the account of the moral absolute against lying
defended here does justice to what bothers reflective people about being
the victim of lies]{.underline}. 39 I have argued that although Finnis
is right to think that the lie is an act directed against the intrinsic
good of knowledge, the wrongfulness of lying is most adequately
explained by reference to the good of practical reasonableness. [Lying
is absolutely morally forbidden]{.underline}, in last analysis, [because
refraining from lying is necessary to show adequate respect for the
status of other agents as practical reasoners]{.underline}. On this
matter, at the very least, natural law theory should affirm its
agreement with Kant. 40

### AT Perm Do the Plan then Rollback

#### Reject the perm 

#### Rollback is intrinsic --- rollback the plan if they say no isn't in the CP or the plan --- makes the aff a moving target because they get to spike out of links 

#### Timeframe is intrinsic -- sequencing is not part of either advocacy --- moots all neg offense

#### It severs out of certainty---

#### The impact is real world education and argumentative responsibility --- fiating your way out of opportunity costs doesn't reflect policymaking and kills our ability to develop advocacy skills ---

v. Dollarsaver s

Food Warehouse of Durant," online:
<http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn14>

4 [[The legal question]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[resolved by the
court]{.underline}]{.mark} is whether the word
\"**[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"[13](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn13)
in the May 18 order connotes futurity or may be deemed a ruling in
praesenti.[14](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn14)
The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of
grammar;[15](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn15)
it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phraseni, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the
trial judge\'s intent must be garnered from the four corners of the
entire
record.[16](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn16)
¶5 Nisi prius orders should be so construed as to give effect to every
words and every part of the text, with a view to carrying out the
evident intent of the judge\'s
direction.[17](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn17)
The order\'s language ought not to be considered abstractly. The actual
meaning intended by the document\'s signatory should be derived from the
context in which the phrase to be interpreted is
used.[18](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn18)
When applied to the May 18 memorial, these told canons impel my
conclusion that the judge doubtless intended his ruling as an in
praesenti resolution of Dollarsaver\'s quest for judgment n.o.v.
Approval of all counsel plainly appears on the face of the critical May
18 entry which is \[885 P.2d 1358\] signed by the
judge.[19](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn19)
True
minutes[20](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn20)
of a court neither call for nor bear the approval of the parties\'
counsel nor the judge\'s signature. To reject out of hand the view that
in this context \"should\" is impliedly followed by the customary, \"and
the same hereby is\", makes the court once again revert to medieval
notions of ritualistic formalism now so thoroughly condemned in national
jurisprudence and long abandoned by the statutory policy of this State.

\"Should\" not only is used as a \"present indicative\" synonymous with
ought but also is the past tense of \"shall\" with various shades of
meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments §
121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
(1984); St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075,
1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge
quotation infra note 15. Certain contexts mandate a construction of the
term \"should\" as more than merely indicating preference or
desirability. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury instructions stating that
jurors \"should\" reduce the amount of damages in proportion to the
amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was held to imply an
obligation and to be more than advisory); Carrigan v. California Horse

(1990) (one of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring that a party
\"should devote a section of the brief to the request for the fee or
expenses\" was interpreted to mean that a party is under an obligation
to include the requested segment); State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215
(Mo. 1958) (\"[should\" would mean]{.mark} the same as \"shall\" or
\"must\" when used in an instruction to the jury which tells the triers
they \"should disregard false testimony\").

### 2NC -- Consultation CPs Good

#### The neg's burden is to prove that multilateral action is best -- we will win that the CP solves better than the aff which proves that consultation is the best policy option

#### *[Education]{.underline}* -- consultation is necessary before taking actions such as pulling arms out of a country because it has impacts that don't only affect the US, makes the CP unique from the plan, other countries care about American arms sales so we must evaluate consultation as a real option. We only read CPs that consult actors relevant to the plan, solves their unpredictability argument

#### *[Strategy]{.underline}* -- consultation CPs force the 2AC to increase critical strategic thinking about the aff in terms of international politics

#### *[Neg flex]{.underline}* -- consult CPs are key to test affs, the aff gets infinite prep time, the CP is a key generic against unpredictable or small affs

#### *[Literature demands]{.underline}* -- there is evidence that says the consultant says yes -- proves that consultation is a key part of the literature on the topic and it is crucial that we debate it

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.

\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word

**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554

word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court

If you\'re reading this in New York, you\'re probably too drunk to
drive. That\'s because [[lawmakers accidentally got too tough with a
get-tough drunken-driving law,]{.mark} inserting an error that set the
standard for \"aggravated driving while intoxicated\" below the amount
of alcohol that can occur naturally. [The one-word mistake makes the new
law unenforceable]{.mark}]{.underline}, says Lt. Glenn Miner, a New York
State Police spokesman. However, drivers with a blood-alcohol content of
0.08% or higher can still be prosecuted under other state laws[. **[In
the legislative world, such small errors]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,
while uncommon, [can carry expensive
consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[In a few cases around the nation
this year, [typos and other blunders have redirected millions of tax
dollars or threatened to invalidate new laws]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [In
Hawaii]{.underline}, for instance, [lawmakers approved a cigarette-tax
increase to raise money for medical care and research.]{.underline}
[Cancer researchers, however, will get only an extra 1.5 cents next
year]{.underline} --- instead of the more than \$8 million lawmakers
intended. That\'s [because legislators failed to specify that they
should get 1.5 cents from each cigarette sold]{.underline}, says Linda
Smith, an adviser to Gov. Linda Lingle. When such mistakes happen, they
often come during the last-minute rush of legislative sessions, says
Bruce Feustel, a senior fellow at the National Conference of State
Legislatures. [[What\'s important]{.underline}]{.mark}, he says[, [is
that lawmakers can fix them before they cause any
harm.]{.mark}]{.underline} Courts generally intercede only in the most
obvious cases, says University of Notre Dame law professor John Nagle.
If judges tried to change every legislative error, Nagle says, \"you get
the courts trying to figure out what they think is a mistake that might
not be a mistake at all.\" New York\'s mistake came in a bill meant to
set tougher penalties and curb plea bargains for drivers well above the
legal intoxication standard. Instead of specifying blood alcohol as a
percentage, as most drunken-driving laws do, New York set its threshold
as 0.18 grams --- \"so low you can\'t even measure it,\" Miner says.
Lawmakers plan to fix the mistake the next time they convene, says Mark
Hansen, a spokesman for the state Senate\'s Republican majority. He says
it\'s not clear how the mistake happened, or why nobody caught it before
legislators voted. [The latest gaffe was in Arizona, where a misplaced
period on the state\'s ballots raised questions about a cigarette tax
voters approved Nov. 7. The law called for an increase of 80 cents per
pack, but the ballot had .80 cents per pack.]{.underline} The state
plans to start collecting the tax when the vote is final, \"but who
knows what might happen?\" says Arizona Revenue Department spokesman Dan
Zemke. [\"[Somebody might go to court and say that\'s enough to throw
the whole thing out.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

### U/Q -- NATO Strong Now

#### The NATO alliance is stronger than ever

**Shaffer**, Acting President, London Center for Policy
Research,2/4/**19**

(<https://londoncenter.org/nato-is-now-stronger-than-ever/>)

[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**NATO) is now stronger than
ever**]{.underline}. What was a Cold War relic is now returned to
service with renewed vigor and teeth.

Take it from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg himself, who said
that President Trump's pressure on European allies to meet their
military funding commitments has had "real results." "President Donald
Trump is having an impact," Stoltenberg told Fox News in a Sunday
morning interview. In all, Stoltenberg continued, "[by the end of next
year, NATO allies will add \$100 billion extra toward defense. So we see
some real money and some real results]{.underline}. And we see that the
clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact." When
asked if he was concerned that President Trump's tough rhetoric might be
"helping Putin splinter NATO," [Stoltenberg said]{.underline} the exact
opposite is happening. "What I see is that actually NATO is united
because we are able to adapt to deliver," he explained. "[North America
and Europe are doing more together now than before]{.underline}." [For
context, U.S. defense spending amounted to just under \$686 billion in
2017, equating to 3.6 percent of GDP. By comparison]{.underline},
Germany spent around \$45 billion on its armed forces last year, or 1.2
percent of GDP. For years, our NATO allies in Europe have shortchanged
the system and relied on the United States to foot most of the bill for
our mutual defense, but President Trump shocked the elites of Washington
and Brussels by demanding that those countries actually meet their
pledges to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense. President Trump
declared during the 2018 NATO summit that the United States will no
longer tolerate other member states spending only a little more than 1
percent of their GDP on defense while the United States "in actual
numbers is paying 4.2 percent of a much larger GDP," saying this is not
fair to U.S. taxpayers and "we're not going to put up with it." While
some European diplomats initially reacted to the President's
pronouncement with outrage, it's now clear that his strategy is bearing
fruit. The biggest loser in all this is Russia---a country that spent
just \$66.3 billion on defense in 2017, a 17 percent decline from the
previous year and the first year-over-year drop since 1998. That means
the \$100 billion in new defense spending promised by our NATO allies in
Europe is nearly double that of Russia's entire 2017 budget. President
Trump is an effective negotiator---proof's in the pudding so to speak.
Despite political criticism (most of it free of facts) both at home and
abroad, [his insistence that our allies meet their spending commitments
has made NATO stronger than it's been for years]{.underline}. His policy
is strength. His Reaganesque view of security is necessary. His goals of
protecting the interests of the United States and our allies are being
realized. Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer is a retired senior intelligence
operations officer and Acting President of the London Center for Policy
Research.

#### NATO is strong now and is an irreplaceable building block for the international order.

**Leyen**, German defense minister, 1/18/**19**

(Ursula von der Leyen,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/opinion/nato-european-union-america.html>)

BERLIN --- In April, [the **N**orth **A**tlantic **T**reaty
**O**rganization]{.underline} will celebrate its 70th birthday. Founded
in the earliest years of the Cold War, [it **is just as relevant
today**, when many feel that the international order is shaken
again]{.underline}. In fact, if NATO did not exist, those in favor of a
free world would have to invent it. [While NATO's key purpose remains to
guarantee the security of its members, it has never been a purely
military alliance. It is a political alliance as well]{.underline},
[based on]{.underline} the [common aspirations]{.underline} of its
members who, as the NATO Treaty says, "are determined to safeguard the
freedom, common heritage and civilization of its peoples, [founded on
the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of
law]{.underline}." [These principles are under assault today. Russian
aggression in Eastern Europe]{.underline}, [Chinese assertiveness in the
South China Sea, the terrorism]{.underline} of the Islamic State
spreading from the Middle East to the capitals of Europe, author[itarian
regimes developing nuclear weapons]{.underline} --- as different as
these challenges are, they have one thread in common: They emanate from
actors who oppose the international order. They try to undermine or even
change the rules that have governed the age of democracy and prosperity
since World War II. The democracies of NATO need to stand together to
overcome these challenges. Collectively, we are stronger than even the
mightiest of us would be on her own. Accordingly, since 2014, [when
Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO has adapted to the situation at
hand]{.underline} --- [as it has done many times in its
history.]{.underline} Among 29 sovereign states with different political
cultures and points of view, such adaptations will always be
complicated, and sometimes even messy. But NATO's ability to change its
priorities and its strategies ensures that the alliance will stand the
test of time. The results are tangible. For one thing, all European
members of NATO have increased their military spending. The German
defense budget, for example, today has increased by 36 percent compared
to when I took office in late 2013. We still have more to do to fairly
share the burden within the alliance, and we are prepared to do more.
But we also keep in mind that burden-sharing is not only about cash, but
also about capabilities and contributions. Germany is thus, as the
second-largest troop contributor to NATO, proud to lead NATO's Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force [NATO has also increased its presence in
Eastern Europe, plays an active role in training Iraqi security forces
and contributing surveillance to the fight against the Islamic
State,]{.underline} continues to support the Afghan government, and
develops its partnerships with like-minded nations such as Australia and
Japan, in addition to much more. In fulfilling its three core tasks ---
collective defense, crisis management and partnerships [--- **NATO is an
irreplaceable building block for an international order** that favors
freedom and peac]{.underline}e. Most of all, NATO is not a
trans-Atlantic organization in name only. [It represents a special, even
emotional bond between the American and the European
continents]{.underline}. For a German, images of the fall of the Berlin
Wall are inextricably linked with the alliance, and my country is
particularly grateful for the security and the opportunities NATO has
been providing for decades. So yes, in addition to the practical
benefits of bases, structures and troops, NATO has a value in and of
itself. Maybe the most basic benefit of NATO is that it provides
reliability in an unreliable world. Our unshakable commitment to Article
5, the NATO treaty's collective defense provision, ensures that our
common security is truly indivisible. We will help our weakest ally just
as we have helped our strongest by invoking Article 5 --- for the first
and only time in NATO's history --- after Sept. 11, 2001. So it is a
good thing that the European Union is now undertaking significant steps
to enhance its military prowess. If members of the European Union
succeed in harmonizing their defense planning and military procurement,
and in intertwining their armed forces, then all of this will add to
NATO's strength. And a stronger NATO will serve the security interests
of all members. Most of all, it will send a clear signal to those
opposing the rules-based international order: We trans-Atlantic allies
are ready and willing to defend our soil, our people and our freedom.
Ursula von der Leyen is the federal minister of defense of Germany.

#### Relations between the US and NATO are strong now

**DOD**, Department of defense, 1/28/**19**

(<https://www.defense.gov/explore/story/Article/1741621/us-nato-relationship-spans-70-years/>)

[The United States is one of the founding members of **NATO**, a
military **alliance**]{.underline} that was formed in 1949 [and is
**still going strong today**]{.underline}, some 70 years later. Acting
Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan welcomed NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg to the Pentagon today to discuss the U.S.-NATO
relationship.Before their meeting, Shanahan praised Stoltenberg for his
work to arrive at an equitable sharing of the security burden. \"[Since
President Trump took office, America's NATO allies have stepped up
defense spending by a total of \$41 billion,]{.underline}\" he said.
\"[Allied defense spending increased by more than 9 percent from 2016 to
2018]{.underline} -- [the largest increase]{.underline} is 25 years. By
2020, our NATO allies are projected to increase defense spending by
approximately \$100 billion.\"NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. It was formed in 1949 to provide collective security
against the threat posed by the Soviet Union. The U.S. viewed an
economically strong, rearmed and integrated Europe as vital to the
prevention of communist expansion across the continent.The original
members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and
the United States. Though the Soviet Union has long since fallen, the
world has continued to be a dangerous place throughout the nearly seven
decades since NATO was formed. Now 29 nations are members of the
alliance. To make it easier for so many countries to communicate, NATO
has two official languages: English and French. This means that it also
has two acronyms --- in French, NATO is OTAN, which stands for
Organisation du Traité de l\'Atlantique Nord. NATO promotes democratic
values and encourages consultation and cooperation on defense and
security issues to build trust and, in the long run, prevent
conflict.One of the founding principles of NATO is Article 5 of its
charter, which states that an armed attack on one member nation would be
considered as an attack on all. The alliance invoked Article 5 for the
first time in its history following the 9/11 attacks. In addition to
contributing to the war effort in Afghanistan, [NATO member nations
responded by helping the U.S. military]{.underline} with airspace
defense and security over the United States and with maritime patrols in
the Mediterranean Sea to guard against movement of weapons and
terrorists.

### U/Q -- NATO Weak Alt Causes

#### Turkey is an alt cause to NATO stability

**Lake**, Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering national security and
foreign policy, **18** (Eli, 07.11.18, "NATO's Real Crisis Is Turkey,

[The weak link in the alliance]{.underline}, in fact, [is
Turkey.]{.underline} [Here is a country slipping into the sphere of
influence of Russia]{.underline} --- the very country that NATO was
created to deter. In December [[Turkey
finalized](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2017/12/29/turkey-russia-reportedly-sign-loan-deal-for-s-400-air-defense-system/)
a deal to purchase the S-400 air defense system from Moscow,
and]{.underline} in April [the Turks broke ground on a Russian-made
[nuclear

plant.]{.underline} [President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan]{.underline}, who last month won an [unfree and unfair
election](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-26/turkey-s-erdogan-doesn-t-deserve-trump-s-congratulations),
[has recently held talks with Putin]{.underline} to discuss the future
of Syria. Russia's attempt to "flip" Turkey --- the term [used
by](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/08/trump-making-impact-on-nato-as-allies-ramp-up-defense-spending-ambassador-kay-bailey-hutchison.html)
U.S. NATO Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison --- is extraordinary
considering the two countries came close to war in 2015 when a Turkish
jet shot down a Russian one that had flown into Turkish territory.
Ideally, this week's NATO summit would be an opportunity for the U.S.
president to cajole European allies into presenting a unified opposition
to Erdogan's conduct. There is no mechanism for kicking a member out of
the alliance, but Turkey should at least begin to feel some pain and
pressure for its drift toward Russia. Trump has not availed himself of
that opportunity. Just look at his [confrontational
remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-11/trump-brings-grievances-to-nato-summit-worrying-u-s-allies)
on Wednesday about Germany or his [tweet on
Tuesday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1016729137409486853)
complaining that NATO allies are "delinquent" in their defense spending.
Past presidents, including Trump's immediate predecessor, have lodged
similar complaints about Europe not paying its fair share. But context
matters. Trump doesn't prod allies behind the scenes; he issues tweets
and diktats aimed at maximizing humiliation. Any chance to shift the
focus to Turkey is lost. "[The president's]{.underline} seeming
[inability to draw a distinction between democrats and authoritarians
has meant that Erdogan is getting away with murder not only domestically
but also within NATO by playing footsie with Russia and Putin," says
Gary Schmitt, a scholar and strategist at the American Enterprise
Institute]{.underline}. The emphasis of this NATO summit, he says,
should be as much on Turkey's misbehavior as on members' defense
spending. The irony is that, for all of his brashness, Trump can claim
some success with his campaign to get the allies to pay more for
defense. NATO Secretary General [Jens
Stoltenberg](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_156729.htm)
said at the summit's opening that member states are no longer cutting
military spending. Eight allies are expected this year to spend 2
percent of GDP on defense, the longstanding benchmark for the alliance.
Meanwhile, NATO has committed to have 30 air squadrons, 30 combat
vessels and 30 mechanized battalions ready to deploy within 30 days to
defend the Baltic States by 2020. Any other American president,
presented with this evidence of Europe's renewed commitment to the
70-year-old trans-Atlantic alliance, would be happy to take yes for an
answer. [Trump]{.underline} is not, to state the obvious, like any other
American president. As he [treats the NATO summit as a stage for a play
about Europeans ripping off America, Turkey is drifting ever closer to
Russia.]{.underline}

#### NATOs weak -- don't have checks on members who are rejecting democracy 

**Dempsey,** nonresident senior fellow at Carnegie Europe and editor in
chief of Strategic Europe, **18** (Judy, 04.03.18, "NATO's Bad Apples,"
np<https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/75962)> np

When a leading NATO member makes public the military positions of
another ally deep inside a war zone, possibly endangering those forces,
NATO remains silent. [When NATO members undermine democratic values and
the basic tenets of the rule of law, including an independent media and
judiciary, they are not taken to task. Over the past few
years]{.underline}---and in particular, over the past nine
months---[several members of the U.S.-led military alliance have run
roughshod over NATO solidarity and the basic principles upon which the
alliance was founded in]{.underline} April 1949. [Turkey]{.underline},
for example, actually [[revealed the positions of French
troops](https://aa.com.tr/en/europe/french-military-cooperating-with-ypg-pkk-terrorists/1104265)in
northeast Syria.]{.underline} Since 2016, according to the AFP, these
forces have been based in areas controlled by the YPG/PKK. The Kurdish
YPG dominates the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan recently sharply [criticized his French
counterpart](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-says-france-could-become-target-for-backing-syria-kurds-idUSKBN1H60LD),
Emmanuel Macron, for meeting SDF leaders in Paris and for offering to
[mediate between the SDF and
Turkey](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43595891). For Erdoğan,
that was tantamount to negotiating with the Syrian branch of the PKK,
which Ankara insists is a terrorist organization. Yet Erdoğan went
further. A [Turkish news
agency](https://twitter.com/MarcPierini1/status/980167033185820673)
revealed the positions of the French forces. What sort of solidarity and
discretion does that amount to, when one ally could endanger another?
Closer to home, [NATO has to contend with [Poland and
Hungary](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/09/04/defending-eu-values-in-poland-and-hungary-pub-72988)undermining
the independence of the judiciary and an independent media, not to
mention that way in which nongovernmental organizations in Hungary have
been vilified and refugees refused shelter.]{.underline} Then [there is
the corruption in the alliance's newest member, Montenegro, and the
persistent attacks on the judiciary and anticorruption watchdogs in
Romania.]{.underline} Altogether, [these examples do much to undermine
[NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm) as
an alliance, whose members pledge "to safeguard the freedom, common
heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of
democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law.]{.underline} They
seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area."
Back in the last 1940s, the rule of law and democracy didn't matter that
much for NATO. The alliance's priorities focused on the security,
safety, and protection of its members (in short, the West). When Greece
and Turkey joined NATO in 1952, their membership was about bolstering
the defenses of this part of Europe against the Soviet threat.
Geostrategic interests and strengthening the anti-Communist bulwark took
precedence over the rule of law and strong, democratic, accountable
institutions. In recent years, when it's come to countries wanting to
join NATO, there has been more emphasis on values and democracy. But in
its own home, [NATO's record for upholding basic principles is far from
stellar. And its reluctance to criticize its allies exposes some of its
intrinsic weaknesses.]{.underline} The first is that NATO countries are
loathed to criticize each other, either publicly or even behind closed
doors in the North Atlantic Council (NAC)---the forum in which alliance
ambassadors meet. The NAC got its fingers badly burned during the
U.S-led war against Iraq in 2002. Apart from NATO countries being so
bitterly divided over the invasion, NAC sessions often ended up in
shouting matches between the American and French ambassadors. NATO's
fragility was exposed for all to see. Yet, wasn't it necessary for
ambassadors to speak out? Yes, they are constrained by their own
governments. But if NATO could not---and did not---speak out against
torture, or [renditions](https://reprieve.org.uk/renditions-inc/), or
the illegality of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, or what is now happening to
Turkey's democratic institutions, then what does that say about the
alliance's principles? [The second weakness is that NATO doesn't have
formal mechanisms to suspend an ally]{.underline}. And even if it wanted
to discipline a member, that would require consensus. Russia, for one,
would be delighted if NATO washed its dirty linen in public. Ever since
its establishment, the Kremlin's goal has been to divide and weaken NATO
with the eventual aim of getting rid of it. But the fact that countries
still want to join NATO show their need for security and reassurance.
Russia's annexation of Crimea and its proxy invasion of eastern Ukraine
confirmed why countries want to sign up to the alliance.
[NATO]{.underline}, however, [does have an informal mechanism at its
disposal. It is intelligence sharing---or the lack of it. One of the
reasons why the big member states of NATO do not share intelligence
across the board is because of the lack of trust, the feeling that the
information will be passed on to non-NATO members (]{.underline}meaning
Russia and China and other countries). Yet [none of the above
legitimates a silence over the rule of law, over the erosion of basic
democratic principles, and over how some allies are endangering others.
NATO, it's time to move on]{.underline}. What about scrapping some of
the many talking-shop committees and instead creating a special
ombudsperson responsible for NATO's core principles?

### NATO Fails

#### NATO is on a path of inefficient, *[incremental growth]{.underline}* -- broadening its agenda will only *[destroy sustainability]{.underline}* 

**Deni,** PhD, **03-18-19** (John R., Professor of Joint, Interagency,
Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) Security Studies at the U.S.
Army War College's (USAWC) Strategic Studies Institute (SSI), Journal of
Transatlantic Studies, p. 158)//EF

[[Over the last 30 years, NATO's]{.mark} evolving [mission]{.mark}
growth [has exhibited]{.mark} **two of the most commonly cited
typologies of organizational change**---**[adaptive learning and]{.mark}
[incremental growth]{.mark}**.35 [The former is rational]{.mark},
empirically driven, [and usually efficient]{.mark}---organizations
change by carefully studying and modifying ends, ways, and means. [The
latter may be rational bu]{.mark}t it [is]{.mark} typically [not
efficient]{.mark}---[new tasks are]{.mark} simply [added]{.mark} on to
old ones, **[without any critical appraisal of purpose]{.mark} or
goals**.]{.underline} With specific regard to the post-Cold War period,
or roughly 1990 until 2014, both of these typologies were evident. [In
some cases [during the 1990--2014]{.mark} time [period,]{.mark} the
alliance engaged in a well-informed, almost methodical shift away from
collective defense and toward crisis management and cooperative
security. For example, [NATO developed the Membership Action
Plan]{.mark} (MAP) [to build norms]{.mark}, establish [guidelines, and
manage]{.mark} the [admission]{.mark} of new member states from Eastern
Europe.36 In a similar way, the alliance developed a robust force
generation system to manage the challenge of providing continuous force
rotations for operations in Afghanistan during an era of shrinking
resources.37 [In other]{.mark} [instances]{.mark} during the 1990--2014
time period, it seems clear that NATO's post-Cold War shift toward
crisis management and cooperative security was characterized by
incremental growth, with [member states push]{.mark}ing [tasks]{.mark}
onto the alliance's plate **[without a knowledge-mediated
approach]{.mark}.** **For example, the addition of energy security to
the alliance's agenda made little sense at a time when there was (and
still is) significant divergence among the member states over what role
NATO should play in this issue area,** or when there was little
understanding of what capabilities or capacity NATO could actually bring
to the table.38 In contrast to the post-Cold War 1990--2014 time period,
since Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 **NATO appears to have
whole-heartedly resorted to incremental growth**. It has done so by
recommitting itself to collective defense while also maintaining or even
augmenting its work in crisis management and cooperative
security]{.underline}. Notably, there has been no significant
strategic-level reassessment of NATO's mission set and no new Strategic
Concept published since the last was released in 2010. The alliance's
embrace of an all-of-the-above approach is largely a function of the
unique principal--agent dynamic at work within NATO and among its member
states, and the complex array of member state interests. [As noted
briefly earlier in this article, in contrast to an international
organization like the United Nations**, [NATO's potential for action
independent of]{.mark} the [interests of its largest]{.mark} member
[states is]{.mark} [extraordinarily
limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** Certainly, there are
instances when NATO's international secretariat or its Secretary General
show signs of autonomy. [However, the alliance organization's ability to
exploit its limited autonomy and truly counteract the desires of its
member states is limited by several factors. First, the Secretary
General's position is not a permanent one but rather a rotating
one---most NATO Secretary Generals serve a single 4-year term---and the
nominees are subject to the unanimous approval of all member states.
This prevents the development of an entrenched leader capable of making
decisions against the wishes of most member states.]{.underline} In
contrast, UN Secretary Generals are nominated by a minimum of 9 members
of the UN Security Council, including no vetoes by the five permanent
members, and then subject to a majority vote of the General Assembly. UN
Secretary Generals normally hold two consecutive 5-year terms. Second,
while it is true that the NATO International Staff consists of many
permanent civil servants, it also is comprised of staf members
temporarily assigned there by individual allied governments. This limits
the autonomy that the International Staff might otherwise develop since
temporarily assigned employees usually fail to develop strong biases
toward the institution they work for, or biases that would displace
their loyalties to their permanent employer back home.39 Moreover, the
International Military Staf (IMS) is comprised almost entirely of
military officials on temporary assignments. The same holds true with
regard to the Allied Command Operations based in Mons, Belgium and the
Allied Command Transformation based in Norfolk, Virginia. At the same
time, the array of sometimes disparate interests among the various
alliance member states drives much of NATO's all-of-the-above approach[.
[NATO exists]{.underline}]{.mark} [for several reasons, such as the fact
that the alliance is a community of (mostly) liberal democracies that
share similar values. What is arguably more critical though is the fact
that the alliance continues [to]{.mark} exist because it provides more
benefits than costs to its members---in short, **it [meet]{.mark}s their
[security needs]{.mark}, at least in part, in an efficient and effective
way relative to other options**.]{.underline}40 Among other ways of
meeting these needs, the alliance satisfies the demands of its member
states by engaging in issue areas of interest to those member states.
For instance, Spain wants security in the Mediterranean Sea and
stability in northwest Africa. Italy desires the same as well as
capacity-building in Africa. Meanwhile, Germany wants a framework for
the further development of its political and economic power that
reassures its neighbors as well as itself. France wants increased
intelligence sharing to mitigate the challenge of returning foreign
fighters. Poland wants reassurance against domination from the East
(Russia) and possibly from the West (Germany). Farther east, the Baltic
States want protection against an existential enemy. The United States
wants political legitimacy and military burden sharing for operations
near and far. [The point is, [NATO's member states often have different
security interests]{.mark}, threat perceptions, and strategic
objectives, [and yet]{.mark} they [all look to NATO as a]{.mark} primary
[means of fulfilling]{.mark} their [interests]{.mark} and meeting their
objectives. **[Accordingly, the alliance responds by]{.mark} [pursuing a
broadening agenda]{.mark}**. **Arguably, [this tendency]{.mark} on the
part of the alliance to pursue a broadening agenda [to satisfy]{.mark}
the sometimes [disparate interests]{.mark} of its member states [has
only gotten worse with enlargement]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Since 1997,
the alliance has steadily grown, and it seems that trend will continue
albeit at a slower rate. In July 2018, the alliance decided to begin
accession talks with Macedonia, and it is possible Kosovo may follow.
Less likely but still possible is membership for Sweden or Finland, as
addressed by Anna Wieslander elsewhere in this special issue. [As
membership grows, definitions of 'why NATO matters' may grow as well,
and with it NATO's agenda.]{.underline} 39 See, for example, Weiss
\[48\], and Jordan \[49\]. 40 For an examination of how this applies to
the USA, see Brands and Feaver \[50\]. 170 Journal of Transatlantic
Studies (2019) 17:157--173 [[The primary challenge]{.mark} confronting
the alliance today [is that it lacks]{.mark} the [capability]{.mark} and
the capacity [to fulfill]{.mark} all of the various [missions and
activities that member states wish to saddle it with.]{.mark} European
defense budgets, on average, steadily declined through most of the
post-Cold War period, and trends have only reversed since 2014. Despite
the turnaround, that acquisition accounts are struggling to keep pace
with demand, [many]{.mark} military [units]{.mark} remain whole on paper
only, and readiness **[continue]{.mark}s [to be
underfunded]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Additionally, even though spending
increases have been broad based, they have also been uneven. The most
signifcant increases have come from those countries with relatively
small military forces, while the 'big four' European NATO
members---France, Germany, Italy, and the UK, which together account for
roughly two-thirds of European NATO military spending---have been
increasing at a slower pace. [[Until these countries pick up]{.mark}
their [defense]{.mark} [spending]{.mark} pace, and until all of the
European allies are able to acquire the equipment, manpower, and
training necessary to fulfill their agreed upon defense plans**[, the
alliance will continue to struggle]{.mark} in its effort to achieve 'all
of the above.'**]{.underline}

#### NATO fails to solve international crisis while making relations with Russia worse

York University and Princeton University, **17** (Stephen F., 10.18.17,
"Have 20 Years of NATO Expansion Made Anyone Safer?""
https://www.thenation.com/article/have-20-years-of-nato-expansion-made-anyone-safer/
) np

[The expansion of the US-led military alliance]{.underline}, which began
in Germany with 13 member states and now stretches to Russia's borders
with 29, [is the largest and fastest growth of a "sphere of
influence]{.underline}" (American) in modern peacetime history.
Throughout the process, [Russia has been repeatedly denounced for
seeking any sphere of security, even on its own borders. NATO expansion
included two broken promises to Russia]{.underline} that the Kremlin has
never forgotten. In 1990, [the Bush administration]{.underline} (and the
West Germany government) [assured]{.underline} Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev that, in return for Russia's agreeing to a united Germany in
[NATO]{.underline}, the alliance [would "not expand one inch to the
east."]{.underline} (Though denied by a number of participants and
commentators, the assurance has been confirmed by other participants as
well as by archive researchers.) [The other broken promise is unfolding
today as NATO builds up permanent land, sea, and air forces near Russian
territory, along with missile-defense installations. NATO "enlargement,"
as it is sometimes benignly termed by its promoters,
continues.]{.underline} Montenegro became a member in 2017 and the "door
remains open," officials say repeatedly, to the former Soviet republics
of Georgia and Ukraine. 2. NATO is more than the world's most powerful
military alliance. With lavishly funded offices, representatives, think
tanks, and other advocates not only in Brussels but in many Western
capitals, it is also a powerful political-ideological-lobbying
institution---perhaps the world's most powerful corporation, also taking
into account its multitude of bureaucratic employees in Brussels and
elsewhere. In the United States alone, scarcely a week passes without
media "news" and commentary produced by NATO-affiliated authors or based
on NATO sources. (See, among other examples, the Atlantic Council and
Newsweek.) 3. Asking whether "enlarged" NATO has resulted in more
insecurity than security requires considering the consequences of
several wars it led or in which several of its member states
participated since 1997: § The Serbian war in 1999 resulted in the NATO
occupation and annexation of Kosovo, a precedent cited by subsequent
secessionists and occupiers. § The 2003 Iraq War was a catastrophe for
all involved and a powerful factor behind expanding organized terrorism,
including the Islamic State, and not only in the Middle East. The same
was true of the war against Libya in 2011, no lessons having been
learned. § NATO promises that Georgia might one day become a member
state was an underlying cause of the Georgian-Russian war of 2008, in
effect a US-Russian proxy war. The result was the near ruination of
Georgia. NATO remains active in Georgia today. § Similar NATO overtures
to Ukraine also underlay the crisis in that country in 2014, which
resulted in Russia's annexation of Crimea, the still ongoing Ukrainian
civil war in Donbass, and in effect another US-Russian proxy war.
Meanwhile, US-backed Kiev remains in profound economic and political
crisis, and Ukraine fraught with the possibility of a direct
American-Russian military conflict. § Meanwhile, of course, there is
Afghanistan, initially a NATO war effort but now the longest (and
perhaps most un-winnable) war in American history. Any rational
calculation of the outcomes of these wars, Cohen points out, reveals far
more military and political insecurity than security, which is mainly
pseudo-security or simmering crises. 4. [NATO expansion has also bred
political-ideological insecurities. NATO's]{.underline} incessant,
ubiquitous media saturation and [lobbying in Western
capitals,]{.underline} particularly in the United States, [has been a
major driving force behind the new Cold War and its rampant Russophobia.
One perilous result has been the near-end of American diplomacy toward
Russia and the almost total militarization of US-Russian relations. This
alone is a profound source of insecurity---indeed of possible war with
Russia.]{.underline} 5. Meanwhile, [the vast resources devoted to NATO
expansion have scarcely contributed anything to resolving real
international crises, among them economic policies in
Europe]{.underline} that have helped inspire secessionist movements;
[international terrorism]{.underline} in the Middle East [and the
refugee crisis; the danger of nuclear proliferation, which NATO has
abetted by spurring a new nuclear arms race with Russia]{.underline};
and others. [Nor does NATO's vast expansion resolve its own internal
crises, as,]{.underline} for example, the [growing alliance between NATO
member Turkey and Russia; and undemocratic developments in other member
states such as Hungary and Poland. And this leaves aside the
far-reaching implications of an emerging anti-NATO alliance centering
around Russia, China, and Iran---itself a result of NATO's 20-year
expansion.]{.underline} 6. Cohen ends by considering the
counter-arguments made by NATO expansion promoters over the years: §
They say the small Baltic and other Eastern European countries
previously victimized by Soviet Russia still felt threatened by
post-Soviet Russia and therefore had to be brought into the alliance.
This makes no empirical sense. In the 1990s, Russia was in shambles and
weak, a threat only to itself. And if any perceived or future threat
existed, there were alternatives: acting on Gorbachev's proposed "Common
European Home"---that is, a security agreement including all of Europe
and Russia; bilateral security guarantees to those once-victimized
nations, along with diplomacy on their part to resolve any lingering
conflicts with Russia, including the endangered status of their own
ethnic Russian citizens. This argument makes no historical sense either:
The tiny Baltic states near Russia were among the last to be granted
NATO membership. § It is also said that every qualified nation has a
"right" to NATO membership if it wishes to join. This too is illogical.
NATO is not a non-selective fraternity or the AARP. It is a security
organization whose sole criterion for membership should be whether or
not membership enhances the security of its members. From the outset, it
was clear, as many Western critics pointed out, it would not. § Later,
it is belatedly argued, Russia did become a threat under its leader
Vladimir Putin. But as the British academic specialist Richard Sakwa has
compellingly argued, any threat Russia now poses was created by NATO
itself, by Moscow's reactions to NATO expansion. Cohen puts this
somewhat differently: Much of what is today denounced as "Putin's
aggression" abroad has been his responses to US and NATO policies. There
is also another negative consequence. Moscow's perception that it is
being increasingly encircled by an "aggressive" US-led NATO has had
lamentable, and predictable, influence on Russia's domestic politics.
[For the sake of international security, NATO expansion must end
now.]{.underline} But is there a way back from the 20-year folly, Cohen
asks. Member states taken in since the late 1990s cannot, of course, be
expelled. But NATO expansion could be demilitarized, its forces
withdrawn back to Germany, from which they crept to Russia. This may
have been possible in the late 1990s or early 2000s, as promised in
1997. Now it is mostly a utopian idea, but one without which the world
is in ever graver danger---a world with less and less real security.

Alliances may not be purely transactional arrangements, but they also
cannot be devoid of strategic logic. [Macedonia]{.underline} clearly
[cannot offer more than a symbolic contribution to NATO's collective
defense.]{.underline} In return, [this small,]{.underline} landlocked
[country can potentially call on the military might of the United States
and most of Europe through NATO's Article 5.]{.underline} Adding
Macedonia to NATO, or for that matter adding any militarily and
geographically irrelevant nations, contravenes two of the most basic
lessons of defensive alliances. First, [weak allies often bring
potential liabilities and conflicts with them.]{.underline} Though the
historical debate rages on, for a century many historians have made the
case that [the cataclysm of World War I began because Germany was
dragged into war by her weak ally Austria-Hungary]{.underline}. More
recently, [in 2011 we]{.underline} saw [the United States
[pulled](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html)
into the]{.underline} strategic [idiocy of the Libyan intervention by
our
[weak](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html)
European allies, Britain and France. The Balkans have been a proverbial
powder keg for centuries.]{.underline} One of the greatest statesmen in
history, Otto von Bismarck, correctly predicted that the next major
European war would start over "[some damned foolish thing in the
Balkans](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/the-war-to-end-all-war-1.1786559)."
More recently, British General Sir Michael Jackson refused a U.S. order
to confront Russian troops in Kosovo in 1999, telling General Wesley
Clark, "I'm not going to start the [Third World
War](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/02/balkans3) for you."
While Macedonia does not have any issues as dangerous as the real and
frozen conflicts of Ukraine and Georgia, it remains a nation with plenty
of its own troubles. Last month, [Macedonia's Prime Minister accused
Greek businessmen allied with Russia of
[meddling](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/pm-pro-russian-businessmen-try-to-foil-macedonia-s-nato-acession-07-16-2018)
in his country to undermine the referendum. Barely a year ago, Macedonia
seemed to be on the [verge of
war](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/03/09/a-macedonian-breakdown-gets-europes-attention)
with its large Albanian minority.]{.underline} It has also been
described as "[the fake news factory to the
world](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/)."
[There is reason to fear that Macedonia could drag NATO into another
nasty little Balkan war.]{.underline} Second, [weak and distant allies
undermine deterrence. Deterrence]{.underline}, not token European
contributions to U.S. interventions, [is NATO's chief value now. Yet
expanding the alliance with more peripheral members calls NATO's
credibility into question. Does anyone seriously believe that we would
send American soldiers to die for Macedonia,]{.underline} particularly
if the conflict had even a shred of ambiguity via "[little green
men](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/watch-out-for-little-green-men/)"
or other aggression short of full-blown conventional war? This weakening
of deterrence is already clear to even a casual observer. On July 17,
Fox News' Tucker Carlson asked President Trump bluntly: "Why should my
son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack?" The president's reply?
"[I've asked the same
question](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-nato-montenegro)."
Of course, [any lack of clarity about America's commitment to NATO's
collective defense under Article 5 makes Russian provocations or even
attacks more likely. When this uncertainty is combined with the
continued failure of our wealthy European allies to meaningfully
contribute to collective defense as required by NATO's Article 3, we
have an alliance that is becoming hard to take seriously.]{.underline}
While the commitments exist, America can and must defend its allies, for
reasons of both honor and self-interest. But adding another weak partner
to an alliance that is already full of them is the last thing in
America's \-- and NATO's \-- best interest.

### NATO Says No -- Generic

As NATO marks its 70th anniversary this week, this unique, often
unwieldy, [29-member alliance is confronting one of the most difficult
sets of challenges in its history. NATO is still the world's strongest
military alliance. But its single greatest danger is the absence of
strong, principled American presidential leadership for the first time
in its history.]{.underline} Starting with NATO's founding father,
President Harry S. Truman, each of our presidents has considered NATO a
vital American interest. [President Trump has taken a dramatically
different path. As former U.S. ambassadors to NATO]{.underline}, we
interviewed alliance leaders past and present for a new Harvard Belfer
Center report: "NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis." [Nearly all
viewed Trump as NATO's most urgent and difficult problem]{.underline}.
[Never before has NATO had a U.S. leader who didn't appear to believe
deeply in NATO itself. During his first two years in office, Trump has
questioned NATO's core commitment embedded in Article 5]{.underline} of
the alliance's founding treaty --- that an attack on one of the allies
will be considered an attack on all. [He has been weak and reactive in
defending NATO against its most aggressive adversary]{.underline},
Russian President Vladimir Putin. [Trump has also been a consistent
critic of European democratic leaders such as German Chancellor Angela
Merkel]{.underline}, while publicly supporting anti-democratic populists
such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. [Trump is the first
president to call the European Union a "foe," rather than a
partner]{.underline}, of the United States. Fortunately, the vast
majority of Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress disagree with
Trump on NATO's value to the United States. They should vote to approve
the bills working their way through committees that would reaffirm the
United States' commitment to Article 5 and to require congressional
approval should Trump try to diminish our commitment to NATO --- or to
pull the United States out altogether. Congress would be acting in
unison with the public's strong support for NATO, according to a 2018
poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Critics who agree with
Trump present three main arguments for why he is right to question NATO.
First, they say NATO's core job was finished with the end of the Cold
War. That ignores, however, Russia's campaign to destabilize NATO
members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. It also ignores Putin's
attacks on the U.S. and European elections in 2016-2018, designed to
weaken our democracies from within. Containing Russian power until
Putin's Soviet-trained generation passes from the scene remains a core
NATO aim. And, as our report shows, there are new challenges beyond
Russia confronting the alliance. Second, [Trump has claimed the allies
are "taking advantage of us." Low European defense spending is indeed a
problem for NATO's future.]{.underline} Germany, in particular, must do
much more. But NATO allies have produced real growth in defense spending
for four consecutive years, starting with Putin's annexation of Crimea
--- a collective increase of \$87 billion. On this issue, Trump would be
smart to continue to push but while doing so strive to transform himself
from chief critic into the unifying leader NATO desperately needs. A
third criticism is that NATO no longer contributes significantly to
U.S. security in the world. Consider the facts: Canada and the European
allies came to our defense on 9/11 and invoked the Article 5
mutual-defense clause of the treaty. They viewed Osama bin Laden's
attack on the United States as an attack on them as well. NATO allies
went into Afghanistan with us where they and partner nations have
suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths. Most of those countries remain
on the ground with our soldiers to this day. NATO allies have also
fought with us in the successful campaign to defeat the Islamic State
caliphate in Syria and Iraq. They conduct counterterror operations with
us in Africa. The European allies have assumed full responsibility for
peacekeeping in Bosnia and the bulk of the burden in Kosovo. U.S. air
and naval bases in allied countries also bring the United States a
continent closer to contain Russia in Eastern Europe and confront
terrorist threats in the Middle East and South Asia. This is a decisive
advantage for the United States. The reality is that NATO is a net plus
for the United States in political, economic and military terms. In the
decade ahead, the United States will fight two battles with
authoritarian powers China and Russia. The first is a battle of ideas
that will center on Moscow's and Beijing's growing confidence in the
superiority of their own systems. We will need the full weight of our
democratic allies in NATO to repudiate the authoritarian model in this
intensifying global debate just as Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald
Reagan did in the past. NATO allies will also be critical in a battle of
technology, as the West competes with a more assertive China in
artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. The United
States has a better chance to maintain its qualitative military edge
over China if we enlist the scientific and productive capacity of all
our allies in Europe as well as in the Indo-Pacific. NATO remains the
great power differential between the United States and Russia and China,
which have no real allies of their own. Trump should reflect on a last
reality that all his predecessors understood. The United States would be
far stronger inside NATO as it faces these challenges than it would be
alone. NATO is not just yesterday's story but is indispensable if
Americans want to reach for the elusive goal we have been chasing since
World War II: a secure United States alongside a united, democratic and
peaceful Europe as its closest global partner.

### NATO Says No -- Turkey 

#### Turkey says no they are anti-US policy

**Walker,** Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs, **07
(**<https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Truly-democratic-and-anti-American>)

[What country in the world is most anti-American]{.underline}? According
to the Pew Global Attitudes Project\'s 47-nation survey released
Wednesday it would not be one of the usual suspects - the Palestinian
Authority, Pakistan, or Venezuela - but rather [America\'s
50-year-**NATO ally, Turkey**]{.underline}. This finding should trouble
the Bush administration deeply; Turkey is exactly the type of
Muslim-majority democracy that officials have been touting as a model
for the Middle East and the Islamic world. Consider the facts: Turkey
ranked dead last in all the most important categori1es on the survey,
something which indicates the depth of anti-American sentiment. Most
tellingly, [Turks have the lowest favorability for both America and its
citizens]{.underline} (9% and 13%). Moreover, Turkey tied with the
Palestinian Authority for the lowest percentage of citizens who think
the US is fair in its Middle East policies, a paltry 2%. Another
disturbing sign for US policymakers is the fact that [Turkey, an active
partner in Afghanistan and a crucial transportation hub for Iraq, has
the second-lowest level of support for the US-led war on
terror]{.underline} ( 9%) of all nations surveyed. It does not stop at
US foreign policy. Turkey had the highest percentage of respondents who
disliked American ideas about democracy (81%) and even the way that
Americans do business (83%). [Turks have never been the most
pro-American Middle Eastern country, yet the drop in favorability from
when Bush first took office]{.underline} (52% in 2000) and even at the
one-year anniversary of the war in Iraq (30% in 2004) to today [is truly
unprecedented]{.underline}. It is shocking. THE TRENDS are clear. We are
not just dealing with the usual anti-Bush or anti-US policy sentiment in
Turkey. [We have now slid into an anti-Americanism that cannot simply be
erased with a new president]{.underline} in January, 2009, or a special
envoy to the Muslim world. The causes of this pervasive anti-Americanism
are fairly straightforward and obvious to even the casual observer. US
missteps in Iraq have heightened Turkey\'s own security on its
southeastern border. In particular, the reemergence of PKK terrorism in
Turkey, where a soldier dies daily, has produced a non-stop drumbeat of
nationalist and anti-American rhetoric throughout the country in the
runup to the July 22 parliamentary elections. The perception that
America controls Northern Iraq and restricts the Turkish army from
crossing the border, all while doing nothing to stop the PKK terrorists
who operate with impunity in Iraq, is widespread. Bush\'s words,
\"You\'re either with us, or against us\" now rings hollow to Turks. [US
policy is increasingly seen as being **hypocritical** and Americans
themselves are now viewed as **untrustworthy**. Turkey has officially
slid from being **anti-US policy to** **anti-American**]{.underline}.
This is particularly worrying given the Bush administration\'s emphasis
on democracy promotion and reform throughout the greater Middle East.
The underlying assumption is that a more democratic and open society is
in the US national interest because such a nation would surely be more
pro-American. Within this context, [Turkey has been a particularly
important country upon which to focus. It is the only Muslim-majority
nation of NATO]{.underline} and the only fully functioning
Middle-Eastern, Muslim democracy. The results from the Pew survey
disprove the preconceived notions of administration experts and should
force policymakers to reconsider their underlying assumptions[. TURKEY
MATTERS to America. Its geo-strategic position is vital for US interests
throughout the region]{.underline}, but, more importantly, it represents
what a truly democratic Middle East might look like. Hating US policy or
a particular president is undesirable, but repairable. Hating America
and Americans is a disturbing trend that requires serious attention and
prolonged engagement.

### AT: Trump Makes NATO Weak 

#### **Trump [is *bolstering*]{.underline} NATO -- his security team, anti-Russia sanctions, and spending push *[all prove]{.underline}*** 

**Bugajski**, Senior Fellow at Center for European Policy Analysis,
**02-07-19** ("Trump\'s criticisms have reinvigorated NATO,"
<https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/428920-trumps-criticisms-have-reinvigorated-nato)//EF>

[The signing of accession protocols by North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) ministers and the government of North Macedonia on
Wednesday demonstrates that, **regardless of his intentions, President
Donald Trump is boosting NATO and reinforcing Western
security**.]{.underline} During and after the election campaign, Trump
declared NATO as redundant and threatened a full-scale U.S. military
withdrawal from the alliance. His pronouncements may have misled both
Europeans and Russians into believing that Washington would terminate
U.S. commitments to Europe's defense. [In reality, Trump's criticisms
have helped to reinvigorate NATO's core missions and capabilities.
Trump's main indignation has been directed at European governments that
consistently allocate under 2 percent of their GDP for national defense
despite NATO's common requirements.]{.underline} Trump threatened to cut
American support if these targets were not met, claiming that American
taxpayers should not bear the main burden for defending a wealthy
Europe. [Trump's words and Russia's threats have had an impact, with
several capitals pledging to boost their spending and improve their
fighting capabilities. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg recently
asserted that Trump's demands have produced results: By the end of 2020,
the allies will have added \$100 billion to their defense
budgets.]{.underline} But the White House needs to recognize that more
important than the 2-percent spending stipulation is the effective
allocation of resources to maximize military capabilities. Washington
must also acknowledge the benefits that NATO consistently affords the
U.S., including basing rights, infrastructure, intelligence sharing,
political and diplomatic support and participation in military missions,
including Afghanistan. [Trump's commitment to strengthening NATO has
been evident in the selection of his security team. In particular, his
vice president, secretary of State and secretary of Defense have **all
been staunch \"Atlanticists\" and committed to a strong
alliance.**]{.underline} [The Pentagon in particular understands that
the Russian threat to Europe is growing and that NATO must be better
prepared to fulfill its mission of common defense. During President
Obama's tenure, Europe's defense was downgraded until Russia's attack on
Ukraine in early 2014 sparked fears about Moscow's revisionist
ambitions. **Trump's team has learned lessons from Obama's naïve
expectations about "resets" with the Kremlin.**]{.underline} NATO can
only negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength. [Trump's
national security team has fortified NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence
along its eastern flank, whereby troops are rotated in several
front-line states through four multinational NATO battle groups that
total some 4,500 soldiers.]{.underline} Poland is also looking to
permanently host a larger contingent of American troops as Moscow
escalates its threats and deployments along NATO's borders. [Washington
has also welcomed new members in the Balkans that can contribute to
regional security, with North Macedonia poised to follow Montenegro into
the alliance over the coming year. All these measures have caught the
Kremlin off guard**. Trump may periodically lavish praise on Putin, but
his cabinet and the Congress continue to ratchet up financial sanctions
against Russia's corrupt elite and have supported weapons sales to
Ukraine and Georgia to help defend them from Russian
attacks.**]{.underline} Unsurprisingly, Moscow's view of Trump has swung
from euphoria to trepidation. Officials are even more worried about
Trump's dismissal of arms treaties with Russia as "bad deals" for
Washington. [With the imminent collapse of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a renewed arms race will prove more
damaging to Russia than the United States. Moscow's violation of the INF
Treaty by developing new land-based cruise missiles to threaten NATO
states will boomerang against Russia, whose defense spending is dwarfed
by the alliance.]{.underline} In the 1980s, Soviet leaders were
outmaneuvered by Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and into
an arms race that bankrupted their economy. Moscow ended up signing
several arms control agreements and the Soviet empire collapsed. A
similar fate could new befall the increasingly impoverished Russian
Federation. [Nearly 30 years after the end of the Cold War, there is no
viable alternative to NATO as an alliance of solidarity that guarantees
the national security of all members, including the U.S. American forces
are deployed in Europe not as an act of altruism but in order to protect
U.S. interests within and beyond Europe and to detect, deter and defeat
adversaries before they feel emboldened to strike against the U.S.
homeland. **NATO is constantly in a process of transformation and
adaptation to new conditions and the alliance should welcome Trump's
questioning of its rationale and capabilities.**]{.underline}
Complacency weakens NATO and can provoke new aggression both against and
within Europe. If a new war erupted, the ultimate cost to the U.S. would
be far greater than the current investment in American security because
Washington simply could not isolate itself while its military, political
and economic interests were being crippled.

#### NATO is *[shielded]{.underline}* from Trump's belligerence -- in the long-term, *[liberal democracy checks]{.underline}*

**Deni,** PhD, **03-18-19** (John R., Professor of Joint, Interagency,
Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) Security Studies at the U.S.
Army War College's (USAWC) Strategic Studies Institute (SSI), Journal of
Transatlantic Studies, p. 158)//EF

For all of these reasons, many of the standard theories regarding
alliance duration and dissolution do not work very well in explaining
the case of NATO. [In order to better explain NATO's endurance, many
scholars have turned to more NATO specific models of behavior. That is,
these scholars have developed models of NATO behavior, or behavior of
states within a NATO context, not simply alliance behavior. **[One of
the most]{.mark} [compelling examples of]{.mark} such [analyses]{.mark}
[argues]{.mark} that [the most important explanatory variable over
NATO's many decades of existence is]{.mark} the role played by [the
democratic form]{.mark}s [of government]{.mark} of its member
states.**]{.underline}29 In terms of alliance duration, the internal
workings of democracies enhance long-term cooperation in three key ways.
[[First, leaders of liberal democracies are periodically
replaced]{.mark}, because they lose to opponents, are term-limited, or
decide to retire from office. [These changes]{.mark} in leadership
[provide necessary opportunities to reexamine old policies and]{.mark}
implement news ones**. Policy changes give NATO member states the
opportunity to [move beyond disagreements]{.mark} of the past [rather
quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Second, power]{.mark} in democracies
[tends to be diffuse]{.mark}, certainly [among branches of
government]{.mark} but also even within branches. This means that even
if a particular political leader in one country disagrees with the
policy of an ally, other political leaders with different perspectives
in those same countries may be able to salvage damaged relations and
prevent a more serious rupture. A good example of this was evident in
2017, [as]{.mark} US President Donald [Trump struggled with]{.mark}
expressing this administration's [commitment to NATO]{.mark}. **As he
did so, [the]{.mark} US [House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed
a resolution]{.mark} [expressing American support for the NATO
alliance]{.mark}.**]{.underline}**30** Consultation and cooperation
between allied countries across different branches of government or
between different executive agencies can facilitate more harmony if
there is discord at the heads of state level. Finally, politicians get
reelected and their political appointees get promoted for doing
something, so saving the alliance from crisis typically gets rewarded.
[Ambitious political up-and-comers always appear on the scene within
democracies, offering ways to repair relations and salvage the
alliance.]{.underline}

[As American officials pillory the European governments for their

[at the American domestic political scene with]{.mark}
[trepidation]{.mark}.]{.underline} 17 [For so much of the Cold War,

NATO]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} Donald J. **[Trump does not have the]{.mark}
intellectual [chops of,]{.mark} says, Robert [Taft, to offer another

that NATO was "obsolete and expensive." [He personifies the possible
rise to power of the next generation of Americans that NATO officials
had so feared, a generation that Lord Cromer thought celebrated the
"rejection of history and its lessons for mankind." 1]{.underline}8 As
candidate Trump explained his views on NATO: "So, uh, I look at, I look
at the fact that it was a long time ago." 19 [**[Trump has continued to
sound an]{.mark} [uncertain trumpet]{.mark} since his inauguration as
president.** [In May]{.mark} 2017, [Trump addressed]{.mark} the [allies

did his advisers realize [he]{.mark} had [changed the speech to

the alliance leaders feared in the past, a problem of democracy.

## Impacts

### AT: Russia !! -- NATO Bad 

#### NATO will decline inevitably -- BUT expansion ruins relations with Russia -- its best for the US to pull out now

**Walt,** Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations
at Harvard University, **18** (Stephen M., 07.26.18, "NATO Isn't What
You Think It Is," Foreign Press,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/26/nato-isnt-what-you-think-it-is/)>
np

3\. [NATO expansion was a mistake.]{.underline} Really. If Trump is
mostly confused about NATO, its [most ardent defenders remain committed
to a set of truisms and dogmas that were questionable when first
advanced and have become less and less defensible with
time]{.underline}. [Chief among these myths is the idea that NATO
expansion would create]{.underline} a vast zone of [peace]{.underline}
in Europe and give the alliance a new and lofty purpose in the wake of
the Cold War. [It hasn't quite worked out that way]{.underline}. For
starters, [NATO expansion poisoned relations with Russia and played a
central role in creating conflicts between Russia and Georgia
and]{.underline} Russia and [Ukraine]{.underline}. It's not the only
reason, of course, and I'm not saying Moscow's responses were legal,
proper, justified, or based on an accurate perception of NATO's intent.
I'm only suggesting that [Russia's response was not
surprising,]{.underline} especially in light of Russia's own history and
the George H.W. Bush administration's [earlier
pledges](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-gorbachev-heard-western-leaders-early)
not to move NATO "one inch eastward" following German reunification. The
architects of expansion may have genuinely believed that moving NATO
eastward posed no threat to Russia; unfortunately, Russia's leaders
never got the memo (and wouldn't have believed it if they had).
Furthermore, [expanding NATO increased the number of places the alliance
was formally obligated to defend]{.underline} (most notably the Baltic
states) but [without significantly increasing the resources available to
perform that task]{.underline}. Once again, proponents of expansion
assumed these commitments would never have to be honored, only to wake
up and discover they had written a blank check that might be difficult
to cover. And we now know that [expansion brought in some new members
whose commitment to liberal democracy has proved to be fairly
shallow.]{.underline} This situation may not be a fatal flaw, insofar as
[NATO has tolerated nondemocratic members]{.underline} (e.g., Turkey) in
the past, but it [undermines the proponents' claim that NATO is a
security community based on shared democratic values and an essential
element of a liberal world order.]{.underline} 4. NATO is an
anachronism. Everyone knows Lord Ismay's famous quip about NATO's core
mission: "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans
down." Irony aside, that pithy summary made a good bit of sense during
the Cold War, and especially during NATO's earliest years, when the U.S.
commitment was less certain, the Soviet threat loomed larger, and
Germany's post-World War II evolution was just beginning and its
endpoint uncertain. None of these rationales applies today. For all the
hype about a resurgent Russia and its obnoxious efforts to interfere in
other states' democratic processes, Russia is in fact a declining power
that poses no threat to dominate Europe. Its population will decline
over time, its median age is rising rapidly, and its economy remains
mired in corruption and overly dependent on energy exports whose
long-term value will probably go down as well. Remember, we are talking
about a country whose entire economy---the ultimate foundation of
national power---is smaller than Canada, South Korea, and Italy. Putin
has played a weak hand well, but the brutal fact is that Europe does not
need the United States to protect it, especially considering that France
and the United Kingdom also have nuclear deterrents of their own. Nobody
needs to worry about keeping the Germans down either. Germany's
population is shrinking and aging, too, and there is no danger of
Germany reverting to its Wilhelmine or Nazi past, and even worrisome
right-wing nationalist groups such as the Alternative for Germany party
sound more like German isolationists than future empire builders. If
anything, the danger is that Europe's largest economy won't do enough to
help fix the continent's continued economic woes. As former Polish
Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski [put
it](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/12/07/germany-is-not-about-to-reinvigorate-the-eu)
back in 2011, he was less fearful of German power than of German
inaction. NATO's dirty little secret, I believe, is the fear that if the
United States leaves, its European members will fall back into the sort
of interstate rivalry that repeatedly convulsed the continent in the
past. Few Europeans (or Americans) say this openly today (although
people such as Christoph Bertram did [back in the
1990s](https://www.amazon.com/Europe-Balance-Securing-Peace-Cold/dp/087003068X)),
but its true purpose now is to preserve America's role as Europe's
"pacifier" of last resort. The problem is that Trump doesn't buy it, and
protecting Europe from its own worst instincts is a harder sell when the
United States faces rising deficits (again), a major geopolitical
challenge from China, and cannot seem to extricate itself from
Afghanistan, the Middle East, or the far-flung and open-ended war on
terror. 5. The United States cannot fix NATO. There's no question that
[Trump's handling of NATO has been deeply disruptive]{.underline}, to no
good purpose. After all, if you want to get tough with China on trade
and do more to constrain Iran's activities in the Middle East, a smart
strategist would get Europe on your side and work constructively with
them toward these ends. Trump has done precisely the opposite: tearing
up the nuclear deal with Iran, starting trade wars with everyone he can
think of, insulting European leaders, and driving his own image (and
that of the United States) down to [levels
unseen](https://news.gallup.com/poll/225761/world-approval-leadership-drops-new-low.aspx)
in years. That might suit some of America's adversaries, but it is [hard
to see how it advances any of the country's core interests or even
Trump's own stated goals.]{.underline} Even so, [NATO's present problems
predate Trump and are largely the result of long-term structural forces.
In the absence of a common,]{.underline} clear, and present [danger,
sustaining an elaborate multinational alliance was always going to be
difficult]{.underline}, and it is in some ways a testimony to past
diplomatic artistry that NATO has kept going as long as it has and
despite the failures in Afghanistan and Libya and the divisions that
erupted over the war in Iraq. [Even if Trump had stuck with the status
quo, reaffirmed the U.S. commitment, and played nicely with Europe's
leaders, it would not have reversed the gradual erosion of the
trans-Atlantic partnership. A better course would have been to start a
gradual,]{.underline} constructive, and if possible amiable [decrease of
the U.S. security role in Europe, making it clear]{.underline} to U.S.
allies [that Washington no longer believed it needed to maintain a
security presence there]{.underline} and that it planned to be either
completely or nearly out in five to 10 years. The United States might
conceivably remain a formal member of NATO, but it would no longer
station forces there, no longer insist that the supreme allied commander
in Europe be a U.S. officer, and no longer expect the Europeans to fall
obediently into line whenever Washington barked orders. Trade,
investment, and tourism would continue, and U.S. arms manufacturers
would be free to sell to European buyers if these states decided to
bolster their defenses. Meanwhile, the United States would be free to
focus on other problems. Contrary to what you might think, I'm not
anti-European, let alone anti-NATO. The alliance was a bold achievement
for its time and one that served both the United States and Europe well
in the past. But as I
[wrote](https://nationalinterest.org/article/the-ties-that-fray-why-europe-and-america-are-drifting-apart-900)
back in 1998: "\[[N\]othing is permanent in international affairs, and
NATO's past achievements should not blind us to its growing
fragility.]{.underline} Instead of mindlessly extending guarantees to
every potential trouble spot, and instead of basing our foreign policy
on a presumption of permanent partnership, it is time for Europe and the
United States to begin a slow and gradual process of disengagement. This
is going to happen anyway, and wise statecraft anticipates and exploits
the tides of history rather than engaging in a fruitless struggle to
hold them back." It was true back then and is even truer today.

#### Russian aggression escalates into war 

**Fisher**, reporter @ Vox, **15** (Max, 06.29.15, "How World War III
became possible," Vox,
<https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war)> np

If you take a walk around Washington or a Western European capital
today, there is no feeling of looming catastrophe. The threats are too
complex, with many moving pieces and overlapping layers of risk adding
up to a larger danger that is less obvious. People can be forgiven for
not seeing the cloud hanging over them, for feeling that all is well ---
even as in Eastern Europe they are digging in for war. But this
complacency is itself part of the problem, making the threat more
difficult to foresee, to manage, or, potentially, to avert. [There is a
growing chorus of political analysts, arms control experts, and
government officials who are sounding the alarm]{.underline}, trying to
call the world\'s attention to its drift toward disaster. [The prospect
of a]{.underline} major war, even a [nuclear war, in Europe has
become]{.underline} thinkable, they warn, even [plausible]{.underline}.
What they describe is a threat that combines many of the hair-trigger
dangers and world-ending stakes of the Cold War with the volatility and
false calm that preceded World War I --- a comparison I heard with
disturbing frequency. [They described a number of ways that]{.underline}
an unwanted but nonetheless [major war]{.underline}, like that of 1914,
[could break out in the Eastern European borderlands]{.underline}. [The
stakes, they say,]{.underline} [could not be higher: the post--World War
II peace in Europe, the lives of thousands or millions of Eastern
Europeans, or even]{.underline}, in a worst-case scenario that is remote
but real, [the nuclear devastation of the planet]{.underline}. I. The
warnings: \"War is not something that\'s impossible anymore\" Everyone
in Moscow tells you that if you want to understand Russia\'s foreign
policy and its view of its place the world, the person you need to talk
to is Fyodor Lukyanov. Sober and bespectacled, with an academic\'s short
brown beard, Lukyanov speaks with the precision of a political scientist
but the occasional guardedness of someone with far greater access than
your average analyst. Widely considered both an influential leader and
an unofficial interpreter of Russia\'s foreign policy establishment,
[Lukyanov is chief of Russia\'s most important foreign policy think tank
and its most important foreign policy journal, both of which reflect the
state and its worldview.]{.underline} He is known to be close to Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. I met Lukyanov around the corner from
the looming Foreign Ministry compound (his office is nearby), at a
small, bohemian cafe in Moscow that serves French and Israeli food to a
room packed with gray suits. He was candid and relaxed. When the
discussion turned to the risks of war, he grew dire. \"[The atmosphere
is a feeling that war is not something that's impossible anymore,\"
Lukyanov told me, describing a growing concern within Moscow\'s foreign
policy elite. \"]{.underline}A question that was absolutely impossible a
couple of years ago, whether there might be a war, a real war, is
back,\" he said. \"People ask it.\" I asked how this had happened. He
said that [regular Russian people don\'t desire war, but rather feared
it would become necessary to defend against the implacably hostile
United States.]{.underline} [\"The perception is that somebody would try
to undermine Russia as a country]{.underline} that opposes the United
States, [and then we will need to defend ourselves by military means,\"
he explained.]{.underline} [Such fears]{.underline}, vague but
existential, [are everywhere in Moscow]{.underline}. Even liberal
opposition leaders I met with, pro-Western types who oppose Putin,
expressed fears that the US posed an imminent threat to Russia\'s
security. I had booked my trip to Moscow in December, hoping to get the
Russian perspective on what were, at the time, murmurings among a
handful of political and arms control analysts that conflict could come
to Europe. By the time I arrived in the city, in late April, concerns of
an unintended and potentially catastrophic war had grown unsettlingly
common. [Lukyanov, pointing to the US and Russian military buildups
along Eastern Europe, also worried that an accident or provocation could
be misconstrued as a deliberate attack and lead to war]{.underline}. [In
the Cold War, he pointed out, both sides had understood this risk and
installed political and physical infrastructure --- think of the
\"emergency red phone\" --- to manage tensions and prevent them from
spiraling out of control. That infrastructure is now gone.]{.underline}
\"All those mechanisms were disrupted or eroded,\" he said. \"That
\[infrastructure\] has been degraded since the end of the Cold War
because the common perception is that we don't need it anymore.\" That
the world does not see the risk of war hanging over it, in other words,
makes that risk all the likelier. For most Americans, such predictions
sound improbable, even silly. But the dangers are growing every week, as
are the warnings. \"One can hear eerie echoes of the events a century
ago that produced the catastrophe known as World War I,\" Harvard
professor and longtime Pentagon adviser Graham Allison --- one of the
graybeards of American foreign policy --- wrote in a May cover story for
the National Interest, co-authored with Russia analyst Dimitri Simes.
Their article, \"Russia and America: Stumbling to War,\" warned that an
unwanted, full-scale conflict between the US and Russia was increasingly
plausible. [In Washington, the threat feels remote. It does not in
Eastern Europe. Baltic nations, fearing war, have already begun
preparing for it. So has Sweden]{.underline}: \"We see Russian
intelligence operations in Sweden --- we can\'t interpret this in any
other way --- as preparation for military operations against Sweden,\" a
Swedish security official announced in March. In May, Finland\'s defense
ministry sent letters to 900,000 citizens --- one-sixth of the
population --- telling them to prepare for conscription in case of a
\"crisis situation.\" Lithuania has reinstituted military conscription.
Poland, in June, appointed a general who would take over as military
commander in case of war. Though Western publics remain blissfully
unaware, and Western leaders divided, many of the people tasked with
securing Europe are treating conflict as more likely. In late April,
[NATO and other Western officials gathered in Estonia,]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} former Soviet republic and [NATO member on Russia\'s
border that Western analysts most worry could become ground zero for a
major war with Russia.]{.underline} At the conference, [Deputy Secretary
General]{.underline} Alexander [Vershbow spoke]{.underline} so [openly
about NATO\'s efforts to prepare for the possibility of Russia launching
a]{.underline} limited [nuclear strike in Europe]{.underline} that,
according to the journalist Ahmed Rashid, who was in attendance, he had
to be repeatedly reminded he was speaking on the record. [One of the
scenarios]{.underline} Vershbow said [NATO was outlining]{.underline},
according to Rashid\'s paraphrase, [was that Russia could \"choose to
use a tactical weapon with a small blast range on a European city or a
Western tank division.\"]{.underline} A few weeks later, the Guardian
reported that NATO is considering plans to \"upgrade\" its nuclear
posture in Europe in response to Russia\'s own nuclear saber-rattling.
One proposal: for NATO\'s military exercises to include more nuclear
weapons use, something Russia already does frequently. II. The gamble:
Putin\'s plan to make Russia great again [Should]{.underline} the
warnings prove right, and [a major war break out in Europe between
Russia and the West,]{.underline} then [the]{.underline} story of that
[war]{.underline}, if anyone is still around to tell it, [will begin
with]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin trying to solve a
problem]{.underline}. That problem is this: [Putin\'s Russia is weak. It
can no longer stand toe to toe with the US.]{.underline} It no longer
has Europe divided in a stalemate; rather, [it sees the continent as
dominated by an ever-encroaching anti-Russian alliance]{.underline}. [In
the Russian view, the country\'s weakness leaves it at imminent risk,
vulnerable to a hostile West bent on subjugating or outright destroying
Russia]{.underline} as it did to Iraq and Libya. [This is made more
urgent for Putin by his political problems at home]{.underline}. In
2012, during his reelection, [popular protests and accusations of fraud
weakened his sense of political legitimacy. The problem worsened with
Russia\'s 2014 economic collapse]{.underline}; Putin\'s implicit bargain
with the Russian people had been that he would deliver economic growth
and they would let him erode basic rights. Without the economy, what did
he have to offer them? Putin\'s answer has been to assert Russian power
beyond its actual strength --- and, in the process, to recast himself as
a national hero guarding against foreign enemies. Without a
world-power-class military or economy at his disposal, he is instead
wielding confusion and uncertainty --- which Soviet leaders rightly
avoided as existential dangers --- as weapons against the West. Unable
to overtly control Eastern Europe, he has fomented risks and crises in
there, sponsoring separatists in Ukraine and conducting dangerous
military activity along NATO airspace and coastal borders, giving Russia
more leverage there. [Reasserting a Russian sphere of influence over
Eastern Europe, he apparently believes, will finally give Russia
security from the hostile West --- and make Russia a great power once
more.]{.underline} Knowing his military is outmatched against the
Americans, he is blurring the distinction between war and peace,
deploying tactics that exist in, and thus widen, the gray between:
militia violence, propaganda, cyberattacks, under a new rubric the
Russian military sometimes calls \"hybrid war.\" Unable to cross
America\'s red lines, Putin is doing his best to muddy them --- and, to
deter the Americans, muddying his own. [Turning otherwise routine
diplomatic and military incidents into games of high-stakes chicken
favors Russia, he believes, as the West will ultimately yield to his
superior will. To solve the problem of Russia\'s conventional military
weakness, he has dramatically lowered the threshold for when he would
use nuclear weapons, hoping to terrify the West such that it will bend
to avoid conflict]{.underline}. [In public speeches, over and over, he
references those weapons and his willingness to use them. He has
enshrined,]{.underline} in Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine, [a
dangerous idea]{.underline} no Soviet leader ever adopted: [that a
nuclear war could be winnable]{.underline}. Putin, having recast himself
at home as a national hero standing up to foreign enemies, is more
popular than ever. Russia has once more become a shadow hanging over
Eastern Europe, feared and only rarely bowed to, but always taken
seriously. Many Western Europeans, asked in a poll whether they would
defend their own Eastern European allies from a Russian invasion, said
no. [Russia\'s aggression, born of both a desire to reengineer a
European order that it views as hostile and a sense of existential
weakness that justifies drastic measures, makes it far more willing to
accept the dangers of war.]{.underline} As RAND\'s F. Stephen Larrabee
wrote in one of the increasingly urgent warnings that some analysts are
issuing, \"[The Russia that the United States faces today is more
assertive and more unpredictable --- and thus, in many ways, more
dangerous]{.underline} --- than the Russia that the United States
confronted during the latter part of the Cold War.\" Joseph Nye, the
dean of Harvard University\'s school of government and one of America\'s
most respected international relations scholars, pointed out that
[Russia\'s weakness-masking aggression was yet another disturbing
parallel to the buildup to World War I. \"Russia seems doomed to
continue its decline --- an outcome that should be no cause for
celebration in the West,\"]{.underline} Nye wrote in a recent column.
\"States in decline --- think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 ---
tend to become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous.\" III. The
drift: How the unthinkable became possible The Cold War was a dangerous
game, but it was a game in which everyone knew and agreed upon the
stakes and the rules. That is not the case today. [The Western side
believes it is playing a game where the rules]{.underline} [are clear
enough]{.underline}, the stakes relatively modest, and the competition
easily winnable. [The Russian side,]{.underline} however, [sees a game
where the rules can be rewritten on the fly, even the definition of war
itself altered. For Russia, fearing a threat from the West it sees as
imminent and existential, the stakes are unimaginably high, justifying
virtually any action or gamble if it could deter defeat and, perhaps,
lead to victory.]{.underline} Separately, the ever-paranoid Kremlin
believes that the West is playing the same game in Ukraine. Western
support for Ukraine\'s government and efforts to broker a ceasefire to
the war there, Moscow believes, are really a plot to encircle Russia
with hostile puppet states and to rob Russia of its rightful sphere of
influence. Repeated Russian warnings that it would go to war to defend
its perceived interests in Ukraine, potentially even nuclear war, are
dismissed in most Western capitals as bluffing, mere rhetoric. Western
leaders view these threats through Western eyes, in which impoverished
Ukraine would never be worth risking a major war. In Russian eyes,
Ukraine looks much more important: an extension of Russian heritage that
is sacrosanct and, as the final remaining component of the empire, a
strategic loss that would unacceptably weaken Russian strength and thus
Russian security. Both side are gambling and guessing in the absence of
a clear understanding of what the other side truly intends, how it will
act, what will and will not trigger the invisible triplines that would
send us careening into war. During the Cold War, the comparably matched
Western and Soviet blocs prepared for war but also made sure that war
never came. They locked Europe in a tense but stable balance of power;
that balance is gone. They set clear red lines and vowed to defend them
at all costs. Today, those red lines are murky and ill-defined. Neither
side is sure where they lie or what really happens if they are crossed.
No one can say for sure what would trigger war. That is why, analysts
will tell you, today\'s tensions bear far more similarity to the period
before World War I: an unstable power balance, belligerence over
peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments, disputes over the
future of the European order, and dangerous uncertainty about what
actions will and will not force the other party into conflict. Today\'s
Russia, once more the strongest nation in Europe and yet weaker than its
collective enemies, calls to mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire,
which Henry Kissinger described as \"too big for Europe, but too small
for the world.\"

#### Russia fears NATO enlargement -- any encroachment on their sphere of influence will cause escalation -- a new European security order is necessary

Studies and Security Studies at Dickinson College, **15** (Andrew T.,

Seeing the world as they do from this geopolitical perspective,
[Russians perceive that NATO's policy of enlargement is butting into
Russia's 'region of privileged interests']{.underline}.45 [Russia
believes that it should naturally have a proportion- ately stronger sway
than the West in its near abroad.]{.underline} In a sense, [Russian
foreign policy is neo-imperialist in its intention to dominate the
foreign and economic relations of its closest neighbours.]{.underline}46
Russia has also produced a tailored version of geopolitics called
Eurasianism. Its founder, Alexander Dugin, has a receptive audience
among Russian political and military elites, and his ideology envisions
an expanded Russia that has the ability to shape politics in Europe, the
Middle East and Asia.47 [Eurasianism theorizes that in order for Russia
to be a Great Power it must dominate the entry and exit points of
Eurasia.]{.underline}48 Ideas such as neo- imperialism, Eurasianism and
seeking 'privileged interest' can all be characterized as geopolitical
views of international relations. [In Russia's geopolitical world-view,
NATO expansion is acceptable only so long as NATO becomes primarily a
political forum and is much less military- oriented.]{.underline} For
this to occur, [the West has to include Russia in the maintenance of
Europe's security]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} [inclusion could be
accomplished]{.underline} either by Russia's joining NATO as a fully
edged member or [through the construction of a new European collective
security apparatus]{.underline}.49 For its part, the West has never
allowed Russia to participate fully in managing Europe's security, and
this partial exclu- sion has fuelled Russian mistrust and rea rmed its
geopolitical perspective. [The fact that NATO greatly expanded its
membership without including Russia in the decision-making
process]{.underline}---while also keeping a strong military presence in
Europe, attacking the pro-Russian Serbian government in 1999, supporting
democratic revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia, recognizing Kosovan
independ- ence in 2008 without Russian approval, and proposing a
European-based missile defence system---[set alarm bells off in
Russia]{.underline}. In this context, [the West's insist- ence that its
liberal-inspired enlargement policy is good for Russia rings hollow. In
Russia's geopolitical world-view, enlargement is highly destabilizing to
its security; and therefore, annexing Crimea to prevent Ukraine from
joining NATO is completely rational.]{.underline}50 But only some of the
blame for this ideological clash can be placed on western shoulders; for
Russia never truly desired to integrate with the West and refused to
adopt a liberal mentality. Even so, given that Russia is apparently
unable or unwilling to change its world-view, then perhaps [NATO should
consider altering its liberal-based policies in a way that better copes
with Russia's intransigence.]{.underline}

#### NATO is currently useless -- but expansionism antagonizes Putin and causes Russian revisionism

**Larison**, a senior editor at *TAC, 5/14/**19***

(Daniel,
<https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/yes-nato-expansion-was-a-mistake/>)

Hal Brands complains about critics of NATO expansion: As for the
critique that it was [**NATO expansion** that **provoked Russian
revisionism**]{.underline}, this argument has always been flimsy. Yes,
[the expansion angered Russian officials, during Yeltsin's time as well
as Putin's]{.underline}. It was undoubtedly humiliating for the fallen
superpower. But the idea that NATO expansion caused Russian aggression
rests on an implicit counterfactual argument that, [absent NATO
expansion, Russia would not have behaved in a domineering fashion toward
countries on its border.]{.underline} There is simply nothing in Russian
history --- and nothing in Vladimir Putin's personality --- that
supports this argument. NATO expansion has been a mistake for the U.S.
because the U.S. didn't need to add any more security commitments in
Europe or anywhere else after the end of the Cold War. The collapse of
the USSR meant that the threat to European peace and security had
substantially diminished. [There was arguably no need for NATO at all,
much less a larger one. The larger alliance has not found "new purpose"
through expansion]{.underline}, but continues to cast about looking for
some reason to exist now that its only real reason for being, [the
Soviet Union, has been dead for almost three decades]{.underline}. That
first took the form of "humanitarian" intervention in Kosovo, an illegal
war that set a precedent that Russia would subsequently exploit, and
then it morphed into supporting the unending war in Afghanistan. In
2011, "humanitarian" intervention was once again back on the menu as the
alliance was dragged into backing a U.S.-led attack on the Libyan
government that destabilized the country and the surrounding region
until today. The last twenty years have seen the continued growth of the
alliance at the same time that the alliance has become increasingly
divorced from its original purpose of defending Europe from attack.
[NATO's expansion during that time has been a mistake, and so has NATO's
attempt to reinvent itself for a world where it is no longer
needed]{.underline}. [There is no question that **NATO expansion has
antagonized Russia and strained U.S.-Russian relations** for the last
two decades]{.underline}. Not every round of NATO expansion has been
equally provocative to Russia, but all of it has been unwelcome to them.
Bringing in the Baltic states was a bad idea primarily because it
overextended the alliance and because the U.S. was extending security
guarantees to states that it could not actually defend. The alliance has
been fortunate that it has never had to back up these commitments. The
U.S. and [NATO were able to "get away" with the earlier rounds because
Russia was weakened enough during the 1990s]{.underline} that it wasn't
in a position to do anything about them. [That doesn't mean that NATO
expansion up until that point was a good idea]{.underline}. All that i[t
means is that it hasn't blown up in our faces yet.]{.underline} It was
the subsequent attempts to push for bringing Ukraine and Georgia into
the alliance that proved to be truly unacceptable to Russia, and it was
the 2008 Bucharest meeting when the alliance promised both states that
they would eventually become members that paved the way for the conflict
between Russia and Georgia later that year. [NATO expansion was not the
cause of]{.underline} the [current conflict in Ukraine, but it
created]{.underline} the context for [Russia's reaction to the overthrow
of Yanukovych and the]{.underline} establishment of a pro-Western
government in Kiev. Had there been no NATO expansion after the end of
the Cold War, or even if there had been no NATO expansion after 2004, it
is unlikely that the August 2008 war and the current war in Ukraine
would have ever happened. Sold as something that promotes European
stability and peace, continued NATO expansion has in fact undermined
both in the last decade and a half. It's true that Russia has not
invaded any countries since they became NATO members, but many of the
alliance's new members don't even share a border with Russia, so it
would be surprising if Russia could have posed a serious military threat
to most of them. Then again, Russia hasn't invaded its other neighbors
that have never contemplated joining the alliance. If Russia were really
the aggressive "revisionist" power that Brands and other hawks make them
out to be, surely they should have done some of their "revisionism"
somewhere else along their extensive borders. The fact that Russia
hasn't done anything like that except in Georgia and Ukraine suggests
that NATO expansion is at the very least an important factor in
explaining their behavior. What would have happened in eastern Europe in
the absence of NATO expansion? We can't know that for certain, but we
can see how Russia handled relations with its other neighbors that
weren't considered as possible members of the alliance. Moscow has
maintained close ties with the other former Soviet republics since the
dissolution of the USSR, and it hasn't had armed conflicts with any of
the others in all that time. One reason for this is that the other
states have no aspirations to join a hostile military alliance. Georgia
and Ukraine have been recent flashpoints because Moscow views a
pro-Western orientation in these countries as a threat, and it views
that orientation as a threat in no small part because NATO's borders
have been been steadily moving eastwards. Russia is responsible for its
own actions, but continued NATO expansion has been a provocation that
would sooner or later cause Russia to react badly.

#### NATO expansionism angers Russia and leads to revisionism

**Gotz**, Institute of Russian and Eurasian studies Uppsala university,
11/15/**18**

(Elias, European Politics and society/Volume 20/133-153)

From this perspective, [**Russia seeks** nothing less than **to
undermine** the very foundations of **the liberal international
order**]{.underline}. The [question of course remains: What lies behind
Russia's revisionist ambitions and policies]{.underline}? Scholars who
subscribe to this perspective argue that Russia's revisionism can be
attributed to three factors. The first is a deep-seated sense of being
wronged by the West over the course of recent decades. It is no secret
that the leadership in Moscow maintains that the West has disregarded
Russia's vital interests after the end of the Cold War and side-lined it
with respect to several important issues -- [**most** notably **NATO
expansion** and the formation of a new security architecture in
Europe]{.underline}. Crucially, however, the argument here is that these
injustices are perceived rather than real 'These are obsessive
assertions with little basis in fact and are more a reflection of
centuries of Russia's paranoia about the vulnerability of its borders
and its insecurity as a nation state. A second and related argument is
that Russia's political class has an imperial mentality, especially
towards smaller neighbouring countries in central Eurasia. According to
Marcel van Herpen, author of the provocative , this mentality has its
roots in the early modern period. 'For the Russian state,' he writes,
'colonizing neighbouring territories and subduing neighbouring people
has been a continuous process. It is, one could almost say, part of
Russia's genetic makeupLondon: Seeker & Warburg.  who argue that
Russia's imperialist essence has remained immutable across the
centuries, regardless of the regime in power. Third, scholars accord
significant weight to the fact that many members of the Putin regime
have a background in the military and security services and to Russia's
authoritarian form of governance. To quote, once again, van Herpen 'the
new Russian imperialism is clearly in the interest of Russia's ruling
political and military elite, whose positions are strengthened and
consolidated by a neoimperialist policy., who asserts that Russia seeks
conflict with the West. That [is because the Putin regime --
nationalist, revisionist, territorially expansionist -- cannot coexist
alongside a democratic Europe willing to stand up for its
principles]{.underline}. [Moscow sees liberal democracy as a threat and
therefore must defeat it]{.underline}. In essence, the argument is that
a confluence of historical, cultural, and domestic political factors
drives Russia's revisionist attitudes and actions How should the West
respond? The answer is clear. The United States and its European allies
must resist Russian revisionism through a mix of containment and
rollback. This means that they should reinforce diplomatic efforts to
isolate Moscow, impose more severe sanctions, and increase NATO military
deployments in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states). Facing reality:
Getting NATO ready for a new Cold War.  In addition, the West should
provide military support to post-Soviet states that stand up to Russia,
such as Georgia and Ukraine, and supply them with lethal weapons. Some
scholars take this a step further and suggest that the West should try
to create or foment unrest in Russia). A preclusive strategy to defend
the NATO frontier. The American Interest (online). Retrieved from. The
goal of such a strategy is to weaken Russia from within and, if
possible, replace the current regime in Moscow with a more pro-Western
government. As Kirchick Russia's plot against the West. Politico.
Retrieved from writes, 'If a prosperous and democratic Europe is a core
national security interest of the United States, as it has been for the
past 80 years, then the Russian regime is one to be resisted, contained
and ultimately dethroned.' Offense, in this view, is the best defence.

#### NATO--Russia tensions are already high -- increasing NATO military influence will risk miscalc and escalation

[The United States and its NATO allies continue to find ways to
antagonize Russia.]{.underline} [The latest provocation is a request
from Norway to more than double the number of U.S. troops stationed on
its territory and deploy them even closer to the border with
Russia.]{.underline} Granted, the numbers involved are not large. There
are currently 330 American military personnel in the country on a
"rotational" basis. Oslo's new request would increase the number to
seven hundred. If the Norwegian government gets its way, the new troops
would be stationed in the far north, barely 260 miles from Russia, in
contrast to the existing unit in central Norway, several hundred miles
from Russian territory. The rotational aspect theoretically complies
with Norway's pledge to Moscow in 1949 when it joined NATO that Oslo
would not allow U.S. bases on its territory. Indeed, Foreign Minister
Ine Marie Eriksen Soriede reiterated that assurance in connection with
the new troop request, contending that there would be "no American bases
on Norwegian soil." Making their official status rotational supposedly
means that the troops are there only on a temporary basis. It is a
cynical dodge that fools no one---least of all Vladimir Putin and his
colleagues in the Kremlin. Norwegian officials also insisted that the
new deployment was not directed against Russia. That assurance has even
less credibility than the rotational rationale. Oslo's request came just
days after nine nations along NATO's eastern flank, including Poland,
the Baltic republics, and Romania called for a larger Alliance (meaning
largely U.S.) military presence in their region. In addition to the move
to increase the number of U.S. troops in Norway, [major NATO military
exercises]{.underline} (war games), code-named Trident Juncture 18, [are
scheduled]{.underline} for October. The focus of those exercises will be
central and northern Norway, and they will involve thirty-five thousand
troops, seventy ships, and 130 aircraft. Nevertheless, Soriede insisted
that she couldn't see "any serious reason why Russia should react" to
Oslo's proposal for an enhanced U.S. military presence. She should
perhaps receive credit for being able to make such a statement with a
straight face. But such transparent dishonesty is a longstanding feature
of NATO's behavior toward Moscow. Even during the Cold War, Western
officials routinely insisted that the Alliance was not directed against
the Soviet Union. In their more candid moments, though, they conceded
the obvious---that NATO was a military mechanism to contain Soviet
power. Granted, it was not the sole purpose. Lord Hastings Ismay, NATO's
first secretary general, stated that NATO was created to "keep the
Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The first
objective, though, seemed to be the most important. [Containment of the
Soviet Union made sense to keep democratic Europe out of Moscow's
geopolitical orbit, and NATO was an important component of that
strategy. But Western leaders continued to apply that model]{.underline}
to a noncommunist Russia once the Cold War ended. Indeed, [they
intensified the containment rationale by adding new members throughout
Eastern Europe]{.underline} and expanding the Alliance to Russia's
border. Those actions were taken despite verbal assurances from
Secretary of State James Baker and West German foreign minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher at the time of German reunification that NATO
would not expand beyond Germany's eastern border. Throughout the
Alliance's inexorable move eastward, Western officials and pundits
insisted that NATO enlargement was not directed against Russia. Indeed,
some members of the Western foreign-policy community argued that the
move would benefit Russia by erasing Cold War dividing lines and
increasing Eastern Europe's political and economic stability. One
wonders whether Westerners thought that the Russians were gullible
enough to believe such absurd arguments, or the proponents actually
believed their own propaganda. [NATO leaders continue to insist that the
Alliance has no offensive intent against Russia]{.underline} or that the
Alliance seeks to undermine Moscow's interests. [But NATO's behavior
belies such assurances. The interventions in Bosnia and
Kosovo]{.underline} that weakened and eventually truncated Serbia, a
longstanding Russian ally, [was certainly not a friendly
act]{.underline}. Stationing Alliance (most notably U.S.) forces and
weapons systems in NATO's easternmost members, (a process that has
accelerated markedly since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014)
likewise is provocative. [Yet Western leaders and publics act as through
Russia has no legitimate reason to react negatively to such
moves,]{.underline} as Soriede stated explicitly regarding the proposed
increase in the U.S. troop presence in her country. [NATO has conducted
several large-scale military exercises in Poland]{.underline} and other
member states, [as well as]{.underline} naval maneuvers [in the Black
Sea near Russia's important naval base]{.underline} at Sevastopol.
Again, the Russians apparently are wrong to regard such actions as
provocative and threatening. [U.S. and NATO leaders need to adopt a much
more realistic attitude. Any nation would regard NATO's behavior as
decidedly unfriendly,]{.underline} and even menacing, if conducted on
its frontiers. [Continuing such actions]{.underline} while cynically
denying their hostile intent [could easily lead to miscalculation and a
catastrophic confrontation.]{.underline} As a first step toward mending
ties with Moscow, the Trump administration should summarily reject
Norway's unnecessary request for more U.S. troops.

[BRITAIN'S VOTE to quit the European Union was a rude jolt to the
encrusted world order]{.underline}. [Now that the EU has been shocked
into reality, NATO should be next]{.underline}. When NATO leaders
convene for a summit in Warsaw on Friday, they will insist that their
alliance is still vital because Russian aggression threatens Europe. The
opposite is true. [NATO has become America's instrument in escalating
our dangerous conflict with Russia.]{.underline} We need less NATO, not
more. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded in 1949 as a
way for American troops to protect a war-shattered Europe from Stalin's
Soviet Union. Today [Europe is quite capable of shaping and paying for
its own security, but NATO's structure remains unchanged.]{.underline}
The United States still pays nearly three-quarters of its budget. That
no longer makes sense. [The United States should remain politically
close to European countries but stop telling them how to defend
themselves.]{.underline} Left to their own devices, they might pull back
from the snarling confrontation with Russia into which NATO is leading
them. Russia threatens none of America's vital interests. On the
contrary, it shares our eagerness to fight global terror, control
nuclear threats, and confront other urgent challenges to global
security. Depending on one's perspective, Russia may be seen as a
destabilizing force in Europe or as simply defending its border regions.
Either way, it is a challenge for Europeans, not for us. Yet [the
American generals who run NATO]{.underline}, desperate for a new
mission, [have fastened onto Russia as an enemy. Secretary of Defense
Ashton Carter preposterously places Russia first on his list of threats
to the United States. Anti-Russia passion has seized
Washington.]{.underline} This week's NATO summit will be a festival of
chest-thumping, with many warnings about the Russian "threat" and solemn
vows to meet it with shows of military force. [The United States plans
to quadruple spending on NATO military projects on or near Russia's
borders. I]{.underline}n recent weeks NATO has opened a new missile base
in Romania, held the largest military maneuver in the modern history of
Poland, and announced plans to deploy thousands more American troops at
Baltic bases, some within artillery range of St. Petersburg. Russia, for
its part, is building a new military base within artillery range of
Ukraine and deploying 30,000 troops to border posts. Both sides are
nuclear-armed. [NATO views trouble between Russia and nearby countries
as a military problem.]{.underline} That makes sense. NATO is a military
alliance run by military officers who think in military terms. [Our
conflict with Russia]{.underline}, however, [is]{.underline} essentially
[political, not military.]{.underline} It cries out for creative
diplomacy. [NATO is a blunt instrument unequipped for such a delicate
task.]{.underline} If Europeans believe tit-for-tat escalation is the
best way to deal with Russia, let them pursue it. But it should be their
choice, not ours. [NATO commanders and their political masters in
Washington do not want to surrender control over European security. They
fear Europeans would seek conciliation]{.underline} with Russia rather
than follow the NATO model of in-your-face confrontation. That prospect
is abhorrent to American generals, politicians, and defense contractors.
[By continuing to finance NATO, we buy the right to flash our swords on
Russia's borders]{.underline}. Some Europeans are unhappy with America's
use of NATO to intensify military pressure on Russia. Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany called the recent maneuvers in
Poland, in which 14,000 American troops participated, "saber-rattling
and war cries." In a clear rebuke to NATO, he added, "[Whoever believes
that a symbolic tank parade on the alliance's eastern border will bring
security is mistaken. We are well-advised to not create pretexts to
renew an old confronta]{.underline}tion." NATO helped to keep peace in
Europe during the Cold War. It is not suited to the 21st century. [By
stoking tension with Russia, it contributes to instability, not
stability.]{.underline} Europe needs a new security system. Unlike NATO,
it should be designed by Europeans to meet European needs, run and paid
for by Europeans. That would allow the United States to step back from a
long mission that may have been noble, but should not last forever.

#### NATO gets in the way of Russian foreign policy that escalates and goes nuclear

**Marketic** , contributor to In These Times. 7/16/**18**

(Branko,
[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/nato-donald-trump-putin-cold-war](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/nato-donald-trump-putin-cold-war//TU-SG))

Meanwhile, back in Europe, [NATO's continued existence]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline}, in fact, [its expansion]{.underline} --- [**has
mostly served to resuscitate** the very issue it was created to
solve]{.underline}: **[Russian aggression]{.underline}**. [Soviet
leaders had long viewed NATO with suspicion]{.underline}, and the fact
that it continued to soldier on even after the ostensible basis for its
existence had ceased to be only heightened this suspicion. According to
declassified documents, both Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin were
repeatedly assured by the first Bush and Clinton administrations,
respectively, that NATO wouldn't expand eastward, something Russians
viewed as unacceptable. Imagine, for instance, how US policymakers might
feel if the Soviet Union had established a military alliance with a
handful of South American states during the Cold War explicitly as a
bulwark against the United States, then when peace at last came, began
inviting more and more South and Central American countries to the
alliance while breaking an explicit promise not to do so. This is
effectively what NATO has done during the 1990s and beyond in Eastern
Europe. With sixteen member states by the end of the Cold War (all North
American and European), NATO has, between 1999 and now 2018, added
fourteen new member states, all from Eastern Europe, including two
(Latvia and Estonia) right on the Russian border. Macedonia has
officially joined as of last week's summit. Not all US officials thought
this was smart. Kennan, for instance, warned at the time that eastward
expansion of NATO would be a "strategic blunder of potentially epic
proportions" and "the most fateful error of American policy in the
entire post-Cold War era." Robert Gates, secretary of defense for both
Bush and Obama, has said that "[pressing ahead with expansion of NATO
eastward ... aggravated the relationship between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Russia]{.underline}." [This was
compounded]{.underline}, said Gates, [by the fact that just a few weeks
after adding its first three eastern European member states in
1999]{.underline}, [NATO began bombing Belgrade, a conflict that was
only prevented from spinning into a wider, more dangerous confrontation
because NATO captain James Blunt]{.underline} --- yes, that James Blunt
--- [and a British general refused to follow Wesley Clark's command to
take control of a Russian-held airport in Pristina, Kosovo]{.underline}.
Kennan's warnings about the [effect of this expansion were]{.underline}
prescient. He warned that it would "[inflame the
nationalistic]{.underline}, [anti-Western]{.underline} [and militaristic
tendencies in Russian opinion]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[impel
Russian foreign policy in a direction decidedly not to our
liking]{.underline}**." When Yeltsin, leading a weakened Russia, had no
choice but to accept NATO expansion at a 1997 summit with Clinton in
Helsinki, Russian politicians denounced it as "the largest military
threat to our country over the last fifty years" and "a Treaty of
Versailles for Russia." "There was no reason for this whatsoever,"
Kennan told the New York Times's Thomas Friedman about the expansion.
"Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then
\[the NATO expanders\] will say that we always told you that is how the
Russians are --- but this is just wrong." As early as 1997, Kennan
fretted that it would result in "a new Cold War, probably ending in a
hot one, and the end of the effort to achieve a workable democracy in
Russia." This is a history that is almost entirely left out of most
defenses of [NATO]{.underline} in the mainstream press, not to mention
in accounts of Putin's aggressive actions. And it's no mere
excuse-making on behalf of the Kremlin. Even Michael McFaul --- Obama's
ambassador to Russia between 2012 and 2014, and far from a Putin
apologist or dove --- acknowledged in a recent debate that Russian
policymakers have reacted to "aggressive US policies," including the
Iraq War and US support for "color revolutions" in Eastern Europe, which
"[intensified conflict and tension in US-Russia relations]{.underline}."
McFaul also argues that the other major ingredient was the 2012 return
to power of Putin, a reactive leader paranoid about American intentions
in the region who is inclined to view US actions with mistrust. [This is
an alarming cocktail]{.underline}, [especially as the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists has warned that t**he world is closer to nuclear annihilation
than it's ever been thanks partly due to tensions with
Russia**]{.underline}. [And it's only been made worse by last week's
summit]{.underline}. While most of the media spent the NATO summit
chiding Trump for supposedly undermining NATO at the behest of Putin,
[the summit produced a marked military escalation implicitly aimed at
Russia]{.underline}, and there is evidence that Trump's haranguing of
European leaders actually succeeded in ramping up already provocative
NATO military spending. Yet not only is there an almost total absence of
voices in the mainstream media calling for a de-escalation of tensions
between the US and Russia, it's members of the media --- liberal ones,
very often --- who are virtually baying for conflict with Putin,
arguing, as George Kennan had warned they would, that Putin's reactive
aggression is simply "how the Russians are." With two minutes until
midnight on the doomsday clock, and [an atmosphere of historically bad
mutual mistrust between Russia and Western leadership]{.underline}, the
commentariat has nearly unanimously cast suspicion on an entirely
routine diplomatic meeting between Trump and his Russian counterpart
(and one Trump has taken more than twice as long to undertake than his
predecessors) where they are set to discuss reducing their nuclear
weapons, before transitioning to calling for its cancellation. When you
ignore Trump's rhetoric --- as commentators correctly tend to do when
the subject is domestic policy --- his administration has been one of
the more aggressive toward Russia in recent memory. That most of the
media ignores this is mirrored by their [fierce, unanimous defense of
NATO]{.underline}, one that [entirely leaves out the alliance's failures
and the fact that it's brought us to this perilous moment]{.underline}.
Turning Back the Clock [At best, NATO is a Cold War relic whose attempts
to broaden its mission in the twenty-first century have been disastrous
failures]{.underline}. [At worst, it's a vehicle for anti-Russian
provocation that both strengthens the hand of reactionary forces in
Russia and **edges the world closer and closer to armed, potentially
nuclear, conflict**]{.underline}. Yes, getting rid of NATO is one of
Putin's most cherished goals. But that fact alone shouldn't color debate
over NATO, any more than it would be a good idea to launch a full-scale
invasion of Ukraine just because Putin wouldn't like it. We are in a
dangerous moment in history, as the vast majority of media coverage has
focused on wild conspiracies about whether or not the US president is
Putin's "asset" instead of on the rapidly escalating tensions between
Russia and the West. This escalation should be rolled back. [One way to
do that involves questioning the continued existence of
NATO]{.underline}, [as it has played a key role in bringing tensions to
their current boiling point]{.underline}. The scope of debate shouldn't
depend on whatever the US president does or says on any given day.

Russian roadblock The post-Soviet Euro-Atlantic paths of Georgia and
Ukraine may be dissimilar, but both countries face Russian hostility to
closer ties and integration with the alliance: Moscow\'s antipathy
towards Georgian and/or Ukrainian membership of NATO and indeed towards
any further enlargement of the alliance continues to act as a roadblock
to accession. [Enlargement has been a persistent irritant for Moscow
since the end of the Cold War,]{.underline} reflected in statements from
Yeltsin\'s 1995 warning that further enlargement would mean a
'conflagration of war throughout Europe' to the 2015 National Security
Strategy (NSS), discussed below.54 Russia\'s then Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov outlined the country\'s view in 1996 in a statement
that, with hindsight, sounds a warning: We do not want the old bloc
divisions to be replaced with new ones that would divide the world into
two parts. That is why Russia is against NATO expansion ... We have
taken a negative position on this and we will stick to it. Of course,
this does not mean that we can veto new admissions ... But we have the
right to protect our national interests, and if NATO advances to our
territory, we will take adequate measures in terms of military
construction and will try to remedy the geo-political situation.55
[Enlargement]{.underline} [was perceived to be aimed at checking
Russia\'s]{.underline} [foreign]{.underline} and domestic [ambitions and
excluding it from]{.underline} [any]{.underline} future [European
security order]{.underline}. [NATO\'s]{.underline} global reach and
[enlargement]{.underline} [have been]{.underline} consistently
[criticized by Moscow in formal policy documents since the accession of
the three Baltic states in 2004, which brought the alliance into the
post-Soviet space]{.underline} and up to the borders of Russian
territory. The 2009 NSS stated that '[plans to extend the alliance\'s
military infrastructure to Russia\'s borders, and attempts]{.underline}
[to endow NATO with global functions that go counter to norms of
international law, are unacceptable to Russia']{.underline}.56 The 2013
Foreign Policy Concept echoed this antagonistic attitude towards NATO
enlargement, describing the presence of the alliance\'s military
infrastructure near Russia\'s borders as violating the principle of
equal security and contributing to the emergence of 'new dividing lines
in Europe'.57 [NATO\'s enhanced capabilities, global scope and
enlargement were identified as the principal risk to Russian national
security in the 2014 military doctrine,]{.underline} while the updated
NSS, published in 2015, makes several references to NATO\'s global reach
and interests, its 'violation' of international norms, further
enlargement and the advance of its military infrastructure towards
Russia\'s borders---all of which are considered as threats to Russian
national security.58 [NATO enlargement has contributed to Russia\'s
perception]{.underline}---buttressed by the alliance\'s action against
Serbia in 1999---[that the alliance is an offensive military
organization that is seeking to undermine the Russian
regime]{.underline} and its system of values, and is prepared to
interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state. [Moscow\'s
reaction to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} 2008 [Bucharest summit
and]{.underline} its subsequent [military intervention in
Georgia]{.underline} surprised many in the international community,
including NATO, and [reinforced growing concerns about an increasingly
assertive Russia]{.underline} [that would take all possible steps to
maintain its traditional 'sphere of influence']{.underline}. Until then,
there had been an assumption that Russian expressions of unease about
enlargement were merely rhetorical, leading to disregard of warnings
such as that uttered in March 2008 by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov that there would be a 'substantial negative geopolitical shift'
if either Georgia or Ukraine became a NATO member state.59 Eight years
later, in July 2016, this warning was echoed by Russia\'s permanent
envoy to NATO, Alexander Grushko, who accused NATO of seeking to impose
new dividing lines on Europe and cautioned that [Russia would do
everything to ensure its defence and that NATO\'s eastwards expansion
would be counterproductive, as it subjected Russia to 'risks and
threats']{.underline}.60 Unfortunately, the alliance has consistently
overlooked (or disregarded) the declared position of the Russian
leadership vis-à-vis further enlargement, thereby triggering the very
renewed divisions between East and West that it has sought to avoid.

Despite these overtures, [NATO and Russia have not been able to achieve
the stated intention of forging a partnership. Russia's sensitivity
regarding the enlargement of the NATO Alliance has been a consistent
source of serious tension.]{.underline} Although few might have
anticipated the deterioration of the European/Eurasian security
environment that we have witnessed as a result of the Ukrainian
conflict, in many respects, [Russia's clash with the West over Ukraine
might have been anticipated.]{.underline} Regrettably, despite all the
changes and new opportunities that were created as a result of the
collapse of the Soviet empire and the end of the Cold War, [NATO nations
and the Russian Federation still remained very much locked into a
perceptual mindset of a bifurcated Europe]{.underline}. While many in
the international security community attempted to move the frame of
reference to new realities and building a common European security
community among nations with significant shared interests, there were
also those who [continued to frame and amplify issues in terms of
the]{.underline} 'great game' or '[contest' among the West and
Russia]{.underline}. Therefore, [rather than fostering a collaborative
security community in]{.underline} which nations in [the Balkans,
Caucasus or Central Asia]{.underline} could maintain and develop ties
both with the Euro-Atlantic community and Russia, [these countries were
positioned so as to have to make a 'choice' -- either the West or
Russia.]{.underline} [The tensions between Russia and the West have
culminated in the current crisis in Ukraine, which
threatens]{.underline} not only [to devastate the society]{.underline},
but also to unravel all progress achieved in building greater peace and
security in Europe and the world since the end of the Cold War. [The
recent annexation of Crimea and intervention in support of separatist
groups in the East represent a desire of the Russian leadership and
society to re-assert Russia's role in protecting perceived interests and
challenging United States and Western influence among their close
neighbours.]{.underline} Moscow's behaviour with respect to Ukraine has
elicited strong objection in the West. At the Wales Summit of September
2014, the 28 members of the NATO Alliance issued the statement
suggesting that 'Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine have
fundamentally challenged our vision of a Europe whole, free, and at
peace...' (NATO

[The Ukrainian crisis has created the deepest rift between Russia and
the West since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. This rift is a
result of a complex mixture of economic, political and historical
factors, but one of its more curious antecedents is a disagree- ment
over an alleged promise made over 20 years ago. [Russia says the origins
of the Ukraine crisis lie in NATO's decision to expand the alliance
eastward]{.underline}. In a televised interview in the spring of 2014,
Russian President Vladimir [Putin asserted: 'We were
promised]{.underline} (I mentioned this at the Munich security confer-
ence) that after Germany's uni cation, [NATO wouldn't
spread]{.underline} eastward. [The then NATO Secretary-General told us
that the alliance wouldn't expand beyond its eastern
borders]{.underline}.' Putin went on to admit that the fear
[of1Ukrainian entry into NATO had partly motivated his decision to annex
Crimea.]{.underline} [The Russian govern- ment views the
situation]{.underline} in Ukraine [through a lens of]{.underline}
repeated western [betrayal]{.underline}, creeping [NATO encroachment and
disrespect for its security concerns]{.underline}. Western governments
see the situation differently. For them, the crisis in Ukraine was
sparked by Russian intervention in the internal a airs of Ukraine via
the illegal annexation of Crimea and the backing of separatist groups in
the Donbas region. As for Russia's complaints of betrayal, western
leaders argue that NATO enlargement plays no part in the crisis because
enlargement provides stability for all of Europe, and therefore is not
threatening to Russia.2 The West attributes the persistent tensions
between itself and Russia to the latter's unwillingness to under- take
liberal reforms and to cooperate with western powers, a reluctance it
sees as arising from historical phobias and longings for the return of
past greatness. It is clear that the two sides view the Ukraine crisis
very di erently. These interpretative differences are more than
semantics or verbal sparring. [Russia--NATO tensions have practical
implications for stability on the European continent]{.underline}. Thus,
it is important to ascertain what, if any, role [NATO's policy of
enlargement did play in creating the Ukraine crisis and to determine
what the future options for enlargement are.]{.underline} This article
contends that the [policy of enlargement caused a signi cant and
longstanding breach in relations between the West and
Russia]{.underline}. Moreover, the [tensions produced by NATO
enlargement are part of a much broader disagreement grounded in the
opposition between a liberal-minded West and a geopolitically-minded
Russia.]{.underline} In order to reduce these tensions, NATO leaders
must admit they have failed in their attempts to turn Russia into a
reliable, western-oriented partner, realize that their open-door
enlargement policy has created insecurity in Europe, and alter this
policy by injecting it with geopolitical reasoning. Geopolitics refers
to the policy-making tool that combines geography, strategy and relative
power.3 It considers how concepts of territory and proximity interact
with political variables, and seeks to create a map of power di
erentials among vari- ous political units.4 In terms of NATO
enlargement, geopolitics means evaluating countries for membership on
the basis not of normative criteria but of how their inclusion increases
overall alliance security, especially in relationship to Russia. It also
suggests that [buffer zones play an important role in international a
airs by reducing tensions between the West and Russia through the
creation of separating space]{.underline}.[5 A geopolitically driven
enlargement policy would seek to establish Ukraine as a neutral buffer
zone]{.underline}. Overall, using geopolitics in enlargement policy
would have the e ect of strengthening the alliance, providing more
exibility in dealing with Russia and, ultimately, [creating greater
stability on the European continent]{.underline}.6 This article begins
by reviewing diplomatic history in order to trace the evolu- tion of
NATO--Russia tensions over enlargement. It shows that [Russia's
opposition to NATO expansion,]{.underline} while uctuating in intensity,
[has been a consistent source of animosity in NATO--Russia relations
since the end of the Cold War. These tensions are]{.underline} more than
a matter of policy dispute; they are [fuelled by opposing
world-views]{.underline}---Russia's geopolitical perspective and the
West's liberal outlook--- [which clash over the structure of European
security.]{.underline} The article also presents three options for the
future of enlargement policy, and shows that a geopolitical strategy
would spur the alliance on to pursue enlargement in the Balkans and
Scandinavia, but would deny admission to Georgia and Ukraine. The
closing sections explain the challenges of adopting a geopolitical
enlargement policy, and describe how such a policy would bene t the
alliance and improve relations with Russia.

### \-\-- XT -- Russia War -- Impact

#### Outweighs on scope, the United States and Russia have the largest nuclear arsenals a war would be catastrophic and kill off all life

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
nuclear war between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Russia]{.underline}, despite horrific casualties, [neither country's
population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the direct effects
of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The aftermath could
be **much worse**]{.underline}: the [burning]{.underline} of [flammable
materials could send massive amounts of smoke into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause sustained
global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption -- **[a
nuclear winter]{.underline}**. According to one model 9 , [an all-out
exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global
temperatures of around 8°C, making it **impossible to grow food
for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave some
survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but they
would be in a very precarious situation and the **threat of extinction
from other sources would be great**. An exchange on this scale is **only
possible between the US and Russia** who have more than 90% of the
world's nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500
warheads each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some
models suggest that even [a small regional nuclear war involving 100
nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious
enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of
starvation,12 [though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale are **unlikely to lead
to**]{.underline} outright **[human extinction]{.underline}**, but this
does suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude
larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised
that there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large
nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area where increased
academic research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a
better understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt,
would have high returns. [It is]{.underline} very [difficult to
precisely estimate the probability of **existential risk from nuclear
war**]{.underline} over the next century, and existing attempts leave
very large confidence intervals. According to many experts, [the most
likely nuclear war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given the relatively modest size of
their arsenals, the risk of human extinction is **plausibly greater**
from a conflict between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and Russia]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

### \-\-- XT -- Draws US into War

#### NATO commitments force the US to come to the defense of allies -- it'll draw the US into war

np

[NATO's Article 5 is]{.underline} dangerously close to [an]{.underline}
automatic [commitment to go to war if a member state becomes embroiled
in any armed conflict. But determining whether an ally is victim or
aggressor can be extremely difficult. The Baltic republics]{.underline},
for example, [have rather tense relations with their Russian neighbor.
Two of them also have large Russian minorities that would likely look to
Moscow for protection if discrimination against them becomes blatant and
onerous. If fighting broke out, it would be extremely difficult to
refrain from coming to the aid of a treaty ally,]{.underline} even if a
Baltic government provoked the incident. [There are other worrisome
possibilities as well]{.underline}. [Consider the November 2015 incident
in which Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter]{.underline} that had
strayed into Turkish airspace for a mere 17 seconds. Moscow's response
to that outrageous action was restrained and peaceful. But [what would
Washington's options have been if Putin had ordered airstrikes against
the offending Turkish missile batteries]{.underline}? One could argue
that Turkey was not the victim of aggression but had committed
aggression. Yet [U]{.underline}.[S. leaders would have been under
tremendous pressure to honor the security pledge to a treaty member.
Continuing the forward deployment of military forces intensifies the
risks that rigid U.S. security commitments already entail. It is
imprudent to station troops,]{.underline} tanks, warplanes, and missiles
[in NATO countries near the Russian frontier. Even a minor incident
could instantly engulf those units in combat,]{.underline} effectively
foreclosing Washington's policy options. Indeed, that is why those
members want the U.S. deployments. Daniel Szeligowski, senior research
fellow at the Polish Institute for International Affairs, emphasized,
"From the Polish perspective, the deployment of U.S. troops to Poland
and Baltic states means a real deterrence since it increases the
probability of the U.S. forces engagement in case of potential
aggression from Russia." For the United States to severely limit its
policy options regarding war and peace was dubious enough when the
stakes involved strategically important allies. But [NATO's membership
expansion since the mid-1990s greatly magnifies the folly. America is
now incurring the same grievous risks to defend tiny, strategically
marginal "allies"]{.underline} (actually, dependents) [such as Slovenia,
Montenegro, and the Baltic republics]{.underline}. The same effect
occurs with the stationing of U.S. forces near the Demilitarized Zone
between North and South Korea. The DMZ would be the flashpoint in any
conflict that erupted between the two Korean states, and American
military personnel would be drawn into the fighting from day one.
[Denying U.S. leaders the element of choice about participating in a war
that involved U.S. allies was the whole point of deploying such tripwire
forces during the Cold War. Such inflexibility was unwise even when the
United States faced an existential threat to its security.]{.underline}
It is incredible folly to perpetuate those self-imposed shackles when no
such threat exists. America needs a policy for the 21st century that
maximizes the republic's options while reducing both its obligations and
attendant risks.

### \-\-- XT -- Burden on US

#### Russia isn't a threat -- NATO only creates an unnecessary burden on the US

[Before President Donald Trump attempts]{.underline} real
[diplomacy]{.underline} with Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} at a summit in Helsinki on July 16, [he\'ll first be
subjected to another summit]{.underline}. That first [summit is a
gathering of leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
These leaders continually assure the United States they are America\'s
best allies, even as most contribute little to America\'s defense and
rack up huge trade surpluses with the United States. Trump will insist
on a better deal but should go farther and wind down U.S. membership in
NATO.]{.underline} After [the alliance was establishe]{.underline}d in
1949, its first secretary general, Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its
purpose concisely: "[to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the
Germans down."]{.underline} The unofficial mission matched the time
well: Western Europe's postwar future was clouded by the prospect of a
Soviet invasion, American insularity, or German militarism---all
possible given the preceding decades of history. [Nearly seventy years
later, none of these concerns still exist.]{.underline} Furthermore,
NATO\'s opposing alliance during the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact, quit the
Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet Union itself passed into history in
1991---twenty-seven years ago. [Despite]{.underline} endless [searches
for a new mission to justify its massive burden on U.S. taxpayers, NATO
has failed to be of much use since then.]{.underline} [As its boosters
like to remind us,]{.underline} after 9/11, [the alliance invoked its
Article 5 mutual-defense provision on our behalf. But action from
America's allies did not follow the grandiose gesture---the NATO mission
in Afghanistan relied mostly on U.S. forces and effectively
failed.]{.underline} Today, the alliance's bureaucrats and some [member
states spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the
organization alive]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and
equip" missions. Yet [NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a
real sense of danger from Russia or anyone else]{.underline}. Among the
twenty-nine members, [only the United States is really serious about its
Article 3 obligations to defend itself, spending approximately \$700
billion]{.underline} or 3.5 percent of its GDP [on defense. No other
NATO member comes close to this proportion,]{.underline} and the [vast
majority fail even to meet th]{.underline}e modest, self-imposed
[requirement to devote at least 2 percent]{.underline} [of
GDP]{.underline} to defense. Britain and Poland are rare members that
meet the 2 percent requirement. One of the worst free-riders is Canada,
which spends just 1 percent of its GDP on security, amounting to \$20
billion. Furthermore, Germany spends a similarly pathetic 1.2 percent.
Compare that to non-NATO members facing real threats, some of which
spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense. These include Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates, who must contend with Iran and spend
nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel, which faces the same enemy,
adds \$15 billion to the equation. Despite protestations of poverty at a
time when their economies have never been larger, [NATO members are more
than willing to rack up additional liabilities, knowing America has
their back. Last year, the alliance welcomed Montenegro. It is now
poised to admit]{.underline} the Former Yugoslav Republic of
[Macedonia]{.underline}, which would mean the United States is pledged
to defend a nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to its own
defense, not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police Department. But [the
reality is there is no truly capable Russian foe seriously threatening
the West. Russia has one million uniformed personnel in its military,
the world's second-largest behind America, but the European Union could
easily afford to match that]{.underline} with its combined \$17 trillion
economy---ten times larger than Russia's. However, it needn't bother as
Moscow spends just \$61 billion on its overwrought military, which
doubles as an employment program. Russia's Vladimir Putin has gotten the
most from Russia's military, occupying parts of Georgia and Ukraine and
gaining influence in Syria by backing the Assad regime. Still, his
success in all three cases rested heavily on surprises that Moscow seems
unlikely to be able to repeat against prepared and adequately funded
European militaries. Yer we should expect to hear none of this nuance at
the NATO summit, as poohbahs of the dying old European political order
gather to tut-tut President Trump in the alliance's fancy new \$1.4
billion headquarters, funded predominantly by American taxpayers. To get
out of this abusive relationship, [Trump should begin the process of
limiting America\'s role in NATO.]{.underline} A good model is that of
Sweden, which cooperates with NATO on some matters and not on others.
[Such an approach could]{.underline} allow joint training, but [end the
practice of having over-burdened U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for
wealthy Europeans\' security.]{.underline} As part of this plan, Trump
could mothball U.S. bases in Europe and shift most resources spent there
and in the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific region, where China and Iran
pose real threats to America---and against which NATO is irrelevant.
Europe is prosperous and treats America like a patsy. Let it stand on
its own.

### AT: Russia !! -- NATO Ineffective

#### NATO is ineffective at responding to Russian threats

One of the interesting aspects of the hysteria is that [NATO's
supporters never seem to think it is necessary to explain why it would
be a bad idea to end the alliance]{.underline}. In a spate of interviews
ahead of the summit, [NATO Ambassador [Kay]{.mark} Bailey
[Hutchinson enumerated the many ways]{.mark} that [Russia
threatens]{.mark} Europe and U.S. [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
[while [the threats]{.mark} [she mentioned]{.mark} -- political
[subversion through]{.mark} social [media]{.mark}, nerve agent [attacks
in]{.mark} Great [Britain]{.mark}, [support for]{.mark} Syrian dictator
Bashar [Assad]{.mark}, [violations of]{.mark} the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty ([INF]{.mark}) treaty, [and]{.mark} annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark} -- are all major threats, they [are not the]{.mark} main
[threats]{.mark} that [the U.S. faces]{.mark} today]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[NATO has been ineffective in confronting]{.mark} these
malign actions by [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO's [ineffectiveness
ought to be the key issue of discussion]{.underline} when considering
its future. But to date, that weakness has been largely overlooked in
the rush to blame Trump for allegedly destroying America's alliances.

#### NATO would not be able to win a war with Russia -- proves they are ineffective at keeping Russia stable

Russia,

It was widely expected that President Trump would give remarks
appropriate to the occasion, praising the alliance and reinforcing its
unifying principle of collective security. Instead, America's [NATO
[allies where chastised for]{.mark} their collective [failure to comply
with]{.mark} a target level of [defense spending]{.mark} equivalent to
two percent of each member's gross national product]{.underline}.
"[[Twenty-three]{.mark} of the 28 member [nations are]{.mark} still [not
paying what they should be paying]{.mark} and what they're supposed to
be paying [for their defense]{.mark}]{.underline}," [Trump scolded the
assembled leaders of NATO]{.underline}. "If all NATO members had spent
just 2 percent of their GDP on defense last year, we would have had
another \$119 billion for our collective defense and for the financing
of additional NATO reserves." [[While he mentioned]{.underline}]{.mark}
the terror attack of [[9/11]{.mark}, Donald [Trump did not raise]{.mark}
the issue of [Article 5]{.mark}, even indirectly]{.underline}.
[[From]{.mark} Donald [Trump's transactional]{.mark} world
[view]{.mark}]{.underline}, when it comes to collective defense, [[you
have to pay to play]{.underline}]{.mark}; Europe was in arrears, and the
president was not about to reward them for that fact. [For]{.underline}
a national defense neophyte like Donald [Trump]{.underline}, [military
prowess is measured in dollars allocated to the task]{.underline},
something that can be measured on a spreadsheet for accountants to pore
over. [For anyone acquainted with the reality of war, however, these
numbers translate into blood and steel]{.underline}. By any standard,
[blood and steel, circa 2017, is prohibitively expensive]{.underline}.
In 1980, the annual cost of maintaining an American soldier hovered
around \$30,000; today that cost is \$170,000 and growing. The M-1
Abrams main battle tank, which entered service in 1980, cost \$4.3
million each. The cost of refurbishing an M-1 tank to the new M-1A2
standard needed to fight and survive on the modern battlefield is
between \$8-10 million. When combined together into an armored brigade
combat team, the 4,700 soldiers, 87 M-1 main battle tanks, and hundreds
of other armored fighting vehicles costs a staggering \$2.6 billion per
year to operate and maintain in a peacetime environment; combat
operations and/or realistic training deployments increase that cost by
at least another billion dollars. For a national defense neophyte like
Donald Trump, military prowess is measured in dollars. These costs are
prohibitively high, which is why only five of the U.S. Army's 15 armored
brigade combat teams are maintained at full readiness levels. The
Heritage Foundation has estimated that [[the U.S.]{.mark} Army
[would]{.mark} need at least [21]{.mark} Brigade Combat Team
([BCT]{.mark}) [equivalents to]{.mark} fight and [prevail in a ground
war in Europe]{.mark}; [it currently maintains three]{.mark} BCTs in
Europe, including one on permanent rotation]{.underline}.
[[Effective]{.underline}]{.mark} European-based [[deterrence would
require an additional three to four]{.mark} American BCTs, at a cost of
more than \$15 billion in annual operation]{.underline} and maintenance
costs, and hundreds of millions in basing and support expenses. Blood
and steel for our NATO allies is no less expensive; the cost of a German
soldier hovers at just over \$100,000 per year, while the cost of a
German Leopard 2 main battle tank built the new 2A7V standard costs
around \$10 million; Germany plans on bringing over 100 Leopard 2 tanks
back into service between 2019 and 2023 (enough to equip two armored
battalions) and increasing the Bundeswehr's inventory to some 320 tanks.
Germany would need to double this amount at a minimum to possess a
realistic deterrent capability, an option mooted by the fact that [the
[German Army has trouble keeping 30 percent of]{.mark} the armored
[forces]{.mark} it currently possesses
[operational]{.mark}]{.underline}. The associated [expenses and relative
operational readiness [status for the French and British]{.mark}
militaries [are]{.mark} about [the same]{.mark} as Germany]{.underline};
[[neither]{.underline}]{.mark} country [[is]{.mark} **even [remotely
prepared]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} fight, let alone [prevail]{.mark}, [in
a]{.mark} major ground [war in Europe against a Russian
foe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: Democracy !! -- Democracy Bad 

#### Democratic promotion causes war

**D'Anieri,** PhD in Governemtn, **17**

(Paul, 09.25.17, "Democratic Peace - or War? Paul D\'Anieri Assesses the
Russia-Ukraine Conflict" URI at Harvard University,

[Does the spread of democracy really lead to peace? Or could it actually
incite war?]{.underline} On Monday, October 2, 2017, Paul D'Anieri will
explore this topic at HURI's [Seminar in Ukrainian
Studies](https://www.huri.harvard.edu/events/calendar/g-3-jm7olhhc5r34oa7h2gnj9jdg38_201710022015.html),
focusing on Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Currently a Eugene and
Daymel Shklar Research Fellow at HURI, D'Anieri is Professor of
Political Science and Public Policy at the University of California,
Riverside. While the talk is centered on the Russia-Ukraine story, it
may be of interest to political scientists and other scholars exploring
democratization and the democratic peace theory more broadly. "I'll be
discussing [the]{.underline} paradoxical ways in which [two things that
we thought would go together in post-communist Europe---democracy and
peace---came into tension with one another]{.underline}, and how [this
played into Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}," D'Anieri said.
"The talk also addresses the competing normative orders that the West on
one hand, and Russia and China on the other, are prescribing to maintain
peace in the future." D'Anieri's presentation, "[Democracy and
Geopolitics in the Conflict Over
Ukraine](https://www.facebook.com/events/1983108201935156/)," takes
place in Room S-050 of Harvard's CGIS South Building (1730 Cambridge
Street). All are welcome to attend. A video of the event will also be
available on [HURI\'s YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/huriyt) for those who can't join
us in person. To gain some more insight into D'Anieri's research and
upcoming presentation, we asked a few questions: HURI: How does this
topic fit into the research you are doing as a [Shklar Fellow at
HURI](https://www.huri.harvard.edu/main/people/past-fellows/fellows-2017-2018/117.html)?
D'Anieri: [My research]{.underline} at HURI [is focusing on the
long-term sources of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I]{.underline} am
looking at the problem both chronologically and thematically. [The
problem of democracy and the spread of democracy is one that comes up
again and again]{.underline}. In the 1990s, [people in the West
generally assumed that the spread of democracy would be a source of
peace in the region, but by 2013, Russia saw democratization as a threat
worth fighting over. I want to delve into how and why that
happened]{.underline}. HURI: Why did you choose this topic? D'Anieri:
[This is an aspect of the current conflict that is not well understood,
and that has important implications in the future, not only for Ukraine
and Russia, but also for the West's relationship with China and other
non-democratic powers.]{.underline} HURI: Aside from the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, are there other instances you know of where democracy is
perceived as a weapon? Any striking similarities or differences?
D'Anieri: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is largely dedicated
helping the members resist the "colored revolutions" they all see as a
threat. While I am not an expert on China, I think that
[China]{.underline} probably [resists liberalization not only to
preserve the power of the current regime, but because it fears that
democracy would undermine China's campaign to become a great
power.]{.underline} HURI: Given the perceived "weaponization" of
democracy and the backlash it incited, do you think this relates at all
to the alleged Russian involvement in the most recent US election? Does
the presidency of Donald Trump change the game when it comes to this
aspect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict? D'Anieri: Russian leaders quite
clearly looked at the colored revolutions and decided that they needed
both to be able to resist them, and to deploy the same tactics for their
own ends. That helps explain their intervention in elections abroad.
Trump is interesting not only in that he naturally adopts some of the
same practices, but also in that he may agree with Putin that it does
not matter whether another country is democratic or not. HURI: Is there
one particular fact or insight about your topic that you find especially
interesting? Anything in your research that surprised you? D'Anieri:
I've been rereading a lot of the US discussion of Russia from the 1990s,
and what's amazing is that [despite]{.underline} the rancorous
[partisanship]{.underline} that characterized almost everything else,
[the right and left]{.underline} [were in unison that the promotion of
democracy was both virtuous and in the national interest]{.underline}.
Similarly, while [a lot of people have criticized the expansion of
NATO]{.underline} in hindsight, [one reason that it went through is that
it made sense both to liberals who supported the spread of democracy and
realists who wanted to hedge against Russian revanchism.]{.underline}
HURI: Anything thing else we should know? D'Anieri: If I wanted to
provoke, I would say this: Some of the potential conclusions of this
research might make us very uncomfortable. While many skeptics have
doubted that democracy causes peace, we haven't really considered that
trying to spread democracy could be a cause of war. If so, there will be
some hard choices to face in the future.

[In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic much was made of China's
effective efforts at disease control and prevention.
China's]{.underline} perceived [success]{.underline} in controlling SARS
[stands in stark contrast with Taiwan's troubled response to its own
SARS outbreak]{.underline}. Why does Taiwan, a geographically small,
densely populated country with a democratic government, wealthy and
modern knowledge-based economy, fail to effectively respond to SARS
whereas big, heavily populated, relatively under-developed and
authoritarian China succeeds? Does regime type explain China's relative
success, and to the extent that regime type matters, what can be done to
compensate for China's 'authoritarian advantage' in crisis response? To
address these questions [I conduct a comparative analysis of pandemic
response by Taiwan and China]{.underline}. Due to space limitations, I
focus primarily on Taiwan, drawing on previous studies of China to
highlight the differences between Chinese and Taiwanese responses. In
the final section I draw on this comparison to identify means to
compensate for China's 'authoritarian advantage'. Crisis and Response
The crisis literature distinguishes between routine crises and novel
crises. In routine crises (frequently recurring crises such as fires and
floods), political leaders may defer to operational commanders -- people
such as fire fighters or police officers - who have dealt with similar
crises in the past. These operational commanders have trained for, and
perhaps experienced similar crises and are able to respond effectively
with only moderate adaptation of existing crisis response procedures
\[[1](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs11366-012-9204-4#CR1)\].
However, this approach cannot be followed in the case of novel crises.
Novel crises are crises where there is little past experience to draw
on. Such crises include massive events such as hurricane Katrina, the
2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami or the 9/11 attacks on the United
States that explode on the scene, or more insidious crises such as the
spread of a previously unknown infectious disease that only slowly makes
itself evident. Of the two types of novel crises the insidious type is
often far more dangerous. The danger lies in the likelihood that the
leadership will fail to recognize the insidious crisis as a crisis
because it develops only slowly and seems amenable to existing response
strategies. As a result, the leadership may become aware of the crisis
only after it has become widespread or more threatening
\[[2](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs11366-012-9204-4#CR2)\].
SARS is an example of insidious crises. It at first went unrecognized
and only slowly did the leadership come to realize the immensity of the
threat it represented. Both forms of novel crises require flexible
leadership and response capabilities. The leadership must quickly
identify the challenge, engage relevant bureaucracies, implement a
response, communicate the nature of the crisis and response effectively
and clearly to the public, and control the message as it is being
broadcast by the media to the public. These already extremely
challenging tasks must be accomplished in a compressed timeframe under
highly stressful conditions. Not surprisingly, governments often fail.
Some [authors argue that an already challenging situation for leaders is
made even more so if they are functioning in a democratic system. In
democracies, major emergencies require involvement by multiple
jurisdictions and many levels of representative government. Coordinating
among these often overlapping and contentious jurisdictions can be
difficult. Politicians must identify and justify priorities and actions
to local leaders, the public and the mass
media]{.underline}.[1](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs11366-012-9204-4#Fn1)
These same authors suggest that the [challenges are less significant in
authoritarian regimes. Authoritarian leaders enjoy an 'authoritarian
advantage', being less likely to need to negotiate with bureaucracies
over jurisdictional powers or struggle to disentangle overlapping
institutions]{.underline}. Furthermore, the media and by extension the
message to the public are more easily controlled.

### AT: Democracy !! -- Resilient 

#### Democracy is [resilient]{.underline}

[When]{.underline} Donald [Trump unexpectedly won the presidential
election]{.underline} of 2016, [many]{.underline} observers
[worried]{.underline} that [the new President's populist proclivities
**would do serious damage to American democracy**]{.underline}.
International experiences as much as Trump's domineering personality and
autocratic style inspired these concerns. After all, hosts of populists
over many decades---from Juan Perón in Argentina to Hugo Chávez in
Venezuela and dozens of others in-between---have pushed their states
toward illiberal or even authoritarian rule. In general, populism stands
in inherent tension with liberal democracy. Populist leaders seek to
boost their personal power and hence see checks and balances as
obstacles to their efforts to advance "the will of the people." Whereas
liberal democracy disperses and limits political power in order to guard
against tyranny and promote fair political competition, populist leaders
seek to concentrate power. Therefore, successful populism tends to
hollow out, if not strangle, democracy. Furthermore, populist leaders
mobilize their supporters through direct, personal appeals rather than
relying on party organizations: They create new, broad and amorphous
mass movements or layer them on top of conventional party organizations
with the aim of weakening or smothering them outright. Populist leaders
use confrontation and polarization to attack "enemies" and incite
conflict in hopes of energizing their followers and solidifying their
backing. Populists demonize critics and treat their political opponents
as foes to be destroyed. By turning politics into a war of "us vs.
them," populism de-legitimates fair competition and weakens free and
open public debate, both of which are crucial for democracy. Populism's
stridency and Manichaean worldview undermine the toleration and humility
that are central to liberal democracy. One year into the Trump
presidency, how have these threats played out to date? And what can we
expect in the years ahead? Because this country has not had a populist
leader occupy the presidency in 180 years, initial expectations varied.
Some thought President Trump would be able to grab political power,
infringe on institutional rules, and undermine democratic competition.
Others believed that independent parties, a robust civil society, and a
strong checks-and-balances framework would contain his populist assault
and forestall damage to democracy. What does the record show so far and
what is likely to occur in the future? [One way to get at this question
is to employ a comparative perspective]{.underline}. In recent years,
many democratic countries in Europe and Latin America have seen the
rise---and sometimes fall---of populist leaders. These experiences
provide lessons on how contemporary populists operate, and how
liberal-democratic forces might respond. From them we can learn much
about the conditions under which populist strategies and tactics tend to
succeed and those that more often portend failure. [**Four Obstacles in
Trump's Path** While populists in Europe and Latin America bear many
similarities to]{.underline} Donald [Trump, they have operated in
different political contexts]{.underline} that need to be taken into
account when drawing comparisons. [The main]{.underline} [differences
concern aspects of the]{.underline} **[institutional
framework]{.underline}**, the **[party system]{.underline}**, the
**[cleavage structure]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[the state of
the economy]{.underline}** when the populists take power. [These
four]{.underline} factors **[augur well for liberal]{.underline}**
**[democracy]{.underline}** in the United States, [making it difficult
for]{.underline} President [Trump's putative populist machinations to
triumph.]{.underline} First, the United States has a presidential system
of government with a clear separation of power between the chief
executive, the two houses of Congress, and the courts. These
[institutional checks and]{.underline} [balances **hinder the populist
quest**]{.underline} [for concentrating personal power. The]{.underline}
[parliamentary systems prevailing]{.underline} [in Europe offer less
resistance]{.underline} to would-be populist autocrats. A party that
wins a majority in the legislature elects the Prime Minister (such as
Viktor Orbán in Hungary), who heads the Executive Branch. This adds up
to a great deal of concentrated power, which facilitates attempts to
strangle liberal democracy. Not only is the distinction between
legislative and executive branches blurred in such systems, but [in most
continental countries the judiciary has less sway over politics than in
the United States. Not even a politically appointed Attorney General can
readily obstruct this separation of authority]{.underline}: Indeed,
under Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, [Congress can impeach
an Attorney General found guilty of criminal behavior, whether the
President who appointed him objects or not.]{.underline} In practice,
Latin America's systems of government also diverge from U.S.
presidentialism. While the continent's constitutions prescribe a clear
separation of powers, Presidents in the region typically enjoy much
greater formal or informal authority than their counterpart in the
United States does. Moreover, some chief executives in Latin America
accrue more power through various machinations that override formal
strictures. In Europe and Latin America, therefore, populist leaders who
command majority support can often establish political hegemony---which
enables them to undermine democracy as they deem desirable. Due to the
institutional framework of the United States, it is much harder for
President Trump to do so. Second, populist leaders usually rise to power
in countries where party systems are weak or are collapsing. Silvio
Berlusconi, for instance, became Prime Minister after a massive
corruption scandal devastated Italy's postwar party system. Similarly,
Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Venezuela's Hugo Chávez won the presidency
when established parties were crumbling. In such fluid settings,
populist leaders can create and dominate their own flimsy, unorganized
mass movements. By contrast, Donald Trump has needed to deal with an
existing party that he does not control and that did not want him to win
its presidential nomination. [The new President]{.underline} commands
fervent support among the Republican mass base, but [faces]{.underline}
at least the [residual distrust and aversion of the GOP establishment.
Because he has to deal with leaders and legislators of an established
party, no matter how hollow and weak compared to earlier times, Trump is
in a comparatively poor position]{.underline}. In this sense, he
resembles Carlos Menem, the Argentine populist who won the presidential
candidacy of the Peronist Party through a primary election in 1988, but
who never managed to dominate his venerable party during his ten years
as President (1989--99). In fact, another Peronist leader eventually
blocked Menem's attempt to perpetuate himself in power. [The political
constraints]{.underline} that influential GOP barons [still impose on
President Trump are also similar to those facing some populist leaders
in European multiparty systems. Silvio Berlusconi's]{.underline} Forza
Italia, for instance, never achieved a parliamentary majority on its
own. Instead, [the Italian populist needed coalition partners to win and
maintain his premiership. For this purpose, he had to negotiate with
powerful politicians whom he did not control. This is one important
reason why Berlusconi never achieved unchallengeable political
**hegemony, and so did not do lasting damage to Italy's liberal
democracy.**]{.underline} Third, Donald Trump won the chief executive
office in a country that suffers from an unusual degree of political and
ideological polarization, which offers him some political opportunities,
but also imposes important constraints on his populist designs. Populist
leaders usually emerge when mainstream parties have converged in their
policy programs and ideological positions.1 Because "the political
establishment" leaves voters few real choices, many citizens flock to
populist outsiders who promise to raise neglected issues. Venezuela's
Chávez, for instance, addressed widespread social problems that previous
governments had failed to resolve; in this way, he won the backing of
65-70 percent of the citizenry. In the United States, by contrast, the
Republican and Democratic parties have engaged in significant
ideological and cultural sorting from the civil rights era onward. As a
result, their party delegations in Congress vote in ever more distinct
ways. The mass bases of the two parties have also moved further apart in
recent years; in particular, fervent right-wing movements have pulled
the GOP away from the moderate center. The [polarization]{.underline}
prevailing [in the United States makes it very difficult
for]{.underline} Donald [Trump to win majority support,]{.underline}
despite the significant appeal of populist entreaties across the
political spectrum. Indeed, his presidential approval ratings have since
May 2017 hovered below 40 percent. How can this U.S. populist credibly
claim to represent "the people" when a majority disapproves of his job
performance and expresses its aversion to his personal leadership? Latin
American populists, like Chávez and to a lesser extent Nestor Kirchner
and Cristina Fernández Kirchner in Argentina, have used landslide
victories in plebiscites and elections to cement their political
hegemony and dismantle or weaken democracy, but the new U.S. leader's
middling level of support makes such a strategy unfeasible. [Americans
are unlikely to coalesce into a broad mass base of support for Trump's
populism as long as ideological and cultural polarization offers real
choices that divide "the people." Fourth, Donald Trump faces a paradox,
because President Obama left the U.S. economy in good shape as measured
by conventional standards]{.underline}, such as growth, inflation, and
unemployment. [When Trump ran for and subsequently took office, the
country was not suffering from a perceived severe or acute
crisis.]{.underline} In comparative perspective, the absence of pressing
problems is unusual. Right-wing populists often emerge when their
country is sliding toward the abyss. By claiming the mantle of the
providential savior, these political outsiders can benefit from dramatic
crises as long as they seemingly or actually manage to pull the nation
away from the brink. Peru's Fujimori and Argentina's Menem, for example,
faced hyperinflation of four to six thousand percent per year. When
these populist presidents boldly defeated the scourge of inflation,
large majorities felt enormous relief. As a result, Fujimori and Menem
won sky-high popularity ratings of up to 70-80 percent, which
subsequently allowed them to dominate politics, change the constitution,
and engineer their own reelection. The United States, however, did not
suffer from a crisis in 2016 comparable to, say, the Great Depression of
the 2007--09 period. Therefore, President Trump has lacked an
opportunity to boost his backing dramatically. The structural problems
that helped to fuel Trump's rise, such as de-industrialization and the
loss of well-paying jobs, are not amenable to quick fixes. A bold
adjustment plan can stop hyperinflation from one day to the next, but
there is no rapid way, especially in a market economy like that of the
United States, to bring back millions of industrial jobs. Even a
determined populist leader like Donald Trump cannot turn the Rust Belt
into a string of shining, modern factories, or magically resuscitate
demand for coal when market factors decidedly point in the opposite
direction. [The absence of an acute but resolvable crisis deprives
President Trump of the chance to win over masses of new followers from
the ranks of independents or Democrats. And a populist who is not very
popular is not very powerful.]{.underline} In sum, [international
experiences suggest that President Trump lacks important preconditions
that would allow him to win overwhelming support, relentlessly
concentrate power]{.underline}, [and undermine liberal democracy.
Populist leaders like Berlusconi and Orbán, Fujimori and Chávez
encountered open doors and unusual opportunities]{.underline}. [By
contrast, the U.S. President faces **four sets of interlocking
obstacles.**]{.underline} [Firm checks and balances limit his power.
The]{.underline} **[unreliable backing of his own party prevents him
from overriding these institutional and political
constraints]{.underline}**. [Ideological polarization and the absence of
an acute crisis restrict his mass support.]{.underline} For these
reasons, **[he cannot make an end run, grab power, and weaken checks and
balances]{.underline}**, as Fujimori and Chávez did by convoking
government-controlled constituent assemblies. [By international
comparison, President Trump confronts an unfavorable environment for
establishing populist hegemony.]{.underline} President Trump's Populist
Strategy Given these four obstacles, what are the prospects of populism
in the United States? International experiences can shed light on
President Trump's political options for dealing with the institutional
and political limitations he faces. These experiences suggest that his
limited mass support makes his strategy of relentless confrontation
likely to fail. Comparative insights also elucidate the strategic
dilemmas confronting the opposition, which can choose between a direct
counterattack against the brash populist or pragmatic efforts to entrap
this inexperienced chief executive in a web of constraints. What emerges
from the following discussion is a sanguine conclusion: [Liberal
democracy in the United States will survive the challenges and risks
that populist leadership poses]{.underline}. [Certainly, Trump will
continue to transgress norms of accountability and civility during his
term, but he is unlikely to effect lasting changes, enshrine them in
institutional reforms]{.underline}, [and thus do more than temporary
damage to liberal democracy.]{.underline} [The U.S. system, sustained by
a pluralist civil society**, has great resilience**. In fact, there is a
good chance that the new President's **norm violations may generate a
liberal-democratic backlash that will reaffirm these principles after
Trump's departure, and perhaps even strengthen their institutional
protection.**]{.underline}

### AT: Democracy !! -- No Impact 

#### No democracy impact\-\--new trends

**Potter, 16** - Assistant Professor in the Department of Politics at
the University of Virginia (Philip B.K. Potter, \"Four Trends That Could
Put the Democratic Peace at Risk,\" *Political Violence at a Glance*,
10-14-2016,

The point is **[that it's not democracy alone that
matters]{.underline}**. Rather it is the limits that these regimes can
put on their leaders to force them to be careful and selective when
doing things like making threats and starting fights. This also means
it's not a baked-in advantage that a democracy can take lightly -- even
well-meaning leaders in democracies have every incentive to figure out
how to slip these constraints. Limits yield long-term advantages, but in
the immediate term they tie leaders' hands, preventing them from
engaging with the international problems or opportunities that they feel
they should. There are four trends that indicate this process is well
under way and is putting the "democratic advantage" at risk.
**[Militaries are less closely tied to voters]{.underline}** Democratic
advantages in conflict are commonly traced to the nature of democratic
militaries and their relationship with political power. Going all the
way back to Kant, there has been the notion that societies with citizen
soldiers and the vote are not going to support unnecessary wars when
they are going to bear the costs. The problem is that Kant's vision
isn't what modern armies look like, and they're intentionally moving
away from the target rather than toward it. In the US, military service
is all-volunteer, and the recruits are increasingly drawn from
concentrated segments of society. This divorces the consequences of
fighting from the day-to-day experience of most voters. Increasingly,
[this is a limited force supplemented by private sector
contractors]{.underline}, [placing even more distance between the
individual with the gun and the democratic process]{.underline}. The
[emphases on covert operations]{.underline}, [Special
Forces]{.underline}, [and technological superiority further **water down
the link between society and soldiers**]{.underline}. This was, in fact,
part of the point of moving to an all-volunteer force and one of the
rationales for investments in stealth, information technology, and
precision guided munitions, e.g. the precision strike complex. [By
replacing bodies with dollars, planners have consistently sought to
increase the flexibility that the US has in its use of
force]{.underline}. In the immediate term, that goal makes sense -- it
allows policy makers to do what they believe needs to be done without
having to worry about a fickle public. But [over the long
term]{.underline}, [it has the potential to lead to **less
caution**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[selectivity when engaging in
conflicts]{.underline}**. **[Adversaries are proliferating and
changing]{.underline}** The [emergence of non-state actors as a primary
threat has further **loosened constraints**]{.underline} on leaders.
[The shift from the possibility of total war with]{.underline} the
[Soviet]{.underline} Union [to myriad smaller-scale challenges
**accelerated the transition**]{.underline} [from a mass military to an
elite]{.underline}, [highly specialized force more isolated from
society]{.underline}. Compounding the challenge, this type of adversary
and conflict leads to more significant informational advantages for
leaders, which make democratic constraints less binding. Citizens and
political opposition are always playing catch-up with the executive when
it comes to foreign policy information, but the challenge is harder when
the **[adversaries are less familiar]{.underline}**, the **[engagements
shorter]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} [the issues **more
complex**]{.underline}. [**Technology is reducing constraint** New
technologies are driving citizens and political opposition ever further
out of the loop]{.underline}. [The extraordinary rise of unmanned
vehicles in combat reduces the risk of casualties and
extends]{.underline} the [range for projecting force]{.underline}. This
has undeniable strategic advantages, but **[there is less visibility
and]{.underline}**, accordingly, **[less accountability]{.underline}**
associated with the use of this technology. This means [leaders worry
less about the ex-post constraints and costs that typically come with
casualties]{.underline}. **[Institutions and practices increasingly
favor the president]{.underline}** The recent nuclear agreement with
Iran was an executive agreement rather than a treaty. This is the norm
-- [most international agreements are now unilateral actions of the
president]{.underline}. A polarized Congress is ever more cautious in
its exercise of what little foreign policy power it has; two years into
the campaign against Islamic State and Congress still hasn't weighed in
one way or the other. In the US this is an expansion of the widely
accepted argument that there are two presidencies -- a constrained one
in domestic politics and a relatively autonomous one abroad. What's
unappreciated is that [this growing presidential autonomy]{.underline}
(which may well be needed to run a Superpower) also **[decreases
constraint]{.underline}** [and with it the foreign policy "advantages"
we associate with democracy]{.underline}. While [these advantages
are]{.underline} real, they are also **[fragile]{.underline}**. [Key
institutional constraints]{.underline} -- such as a robust political
opposition and a knowledgeable citizenry -- [are susceptible to
seemingly **minor changes**]{.underline} [in institutions and/or
practices that loosen the limits of leaders' foreign policy
decisions]{.underline}. [As technologies advance]{.underline}, [threats
shift]{.underline}, [and institutional constraints wax and
wane]{.underline}, **[the foreign policy advantages embedded within
democratic systems may begin to erode]{.underline}**. The potential for
such a shift is a possibility that should not be taken lightly.

#### Their studies are epistemically suspect -- democracy doesn't promote peace

**Doorenspleet 2019** - Department of Politics and International Studies
University of Warwick\
Renske, *Rethinking the Value of Democracy*, Palgrave, p. 90-92

[Almost all studies which try to explain war between countries have
included the factor of democracy as one of the possible
explanations.]{.underline} However, [those studies do not simply include
a country's level of democracy in their analyses**, but instead tend to
focus on 'democratic dyads'**]{.underline}. Hence, they look at
explaining peace among democracies. [They do not study the involvement
of democracies in war in general]{.underline}, [or whether democracies
are more peaceful in general]{.underline}. They study the 'dyadic
democratic peace hypothesis', which states that it is less likely that
democracies fight with each other, compared to other 'dyads' or other
pairs of different types of political systems. [The 'monadic democratic
peace hypothesis' has hardly been tested in research.]{.underline} This
lack of attention is not surprising, given the historical background of
the democratic peace field (cf. Geis et al. 2006: 4). This field has
evolved in the subfield of international relations and started as an
alternative to the dominant realist assumptions about war as a regular
feature of politics in an anarchical system. This alternative research
programme was built around topics of international cooperation and
regime building, and the main focus was on how to explain cooperation
and peace at the international level. So, the emphasis was, for example,
on the question whether democracies would fight less with each other.
However, in this way, scholars have missed some other crucial questions.
For example, how to explain war in general? Are some types of political
systems less war-prone than others? Or, formulated slightly differently,
are democracies more peaceful than other types of political systems? [As
a consequence, statistical studies focusing on such questions are rare,
and the results are confusing]{.underline}.

#### Democratic peace theory is a statistical artifact\-\--empirical analysis 

**Mousseau 18** -- Professor @ UCF, PhD PoliSci @ Binghamton \[Michael,
*Conflict Management and Peace Science*, "Grasping the scientific
evidence: The contractualist peace supersedes the democratic peace",
*Vol 35(2) 175-192,* SagePub, accessed 8/21/18\]

A weighty controversy has enveloped the study of international conflict:
whether the democratic peace, the observed dearth of militarized
conflict between democratic nations, may be spurious and accounted for
by institutionalized market ''contractualist'' economy. I have offered
theory and evidence that economic norms, specifically contractualist
economy, appear to account for both the explanans (democracy) and the
explanandum (peace) in the democratic peace research program (Mousseau,
2009, 2012a, 2013; see also Mousseau et al., 2013a, b). Five studies
have responded with several arguments for why we should continue to
believe that democracy causes peace (Dafoe, 2011; Dafoe and Russett,
2013; Dafoe et al., 2013; Ray, 2013; Russett, 2010). Resolution of this
controversy is fundamental to the study and practice of international
relations. The observation of democratic peace is ''the closest thing we
have to an empirical law'' in the study of global politics (Levy, 1988:
662), and carries the profound implication that the spread of democracy
will end war. New economic norms theory, on the other hand, yields the
contrary implication that universal democracy will not end war. Instead,
it is market-oriented development that creates a culture of contracting,
and this culture legitimates democracy within nations and causes peace
among them. The policy implications could hardly be more divergent: to
end war (and support democracy), the contractualist democracies should
promote the economies of nations at risk (Krieger and Meierrieks, 2015;
Meierrieks, 2012; Mousseau, 2000, 2009, 2012a, 2013; Nieman, 2015). In
the literature are five factual claims for why we should continue to
believe that democracy causes peace: (1) an assertion that in three of
the five studies that overturned the democratic peace (Mousseau, 2013;
Mousseau et al., 2013a, b), the insignificance of democracy controlling
for contractualist economy is due to the treatment of missing data for
contractualist economy (Dafoe et al., 2013, henceforth DOR); (2) a claim
of error in the measure for conflict (DOR) that appears in one of the
five studies that overturned the democratic peace (Mousseau, 2013); (3)
an alleged misinterpretation of an interaction term that appears in one
of the five studies (Mousseau, 2009) that overturned the democratic
peace, along with in inference of democratic causality from an
interaction of democracy with contractualist economy (Dafoe and Russett,
2013; DOR); (4) a claim of reverse causality, of democracy causing
contractualist economy (Ray, 2013); and (5) a report of multiple
regressions with most said to show democratic significance after
controlling for contractualist economy (DOR). This study investigates
all five of these factual claims. I begin by addressing the issue of
missing data by constructing two entirely new measures for
contractualist economy. I then take up possible measurement error in the
dependent variable by reporting tests using both my own (Mousseau, 2013)
and DOR's measures for conflict. Next, I disaggregate the data to
investigate a causal interaction of democracy with contractualist
economy. I then examine the evidence for reverse causality, and
scrutinize the competing test models to pinpoint the exact factors that
can account for differences in test outcomes. The [results are
consistent across **all tests**:]{.underline} [there is **no credible
evidence** supporting democracy as a cause of peace]{.underline}. Using
DOR's base model, [the impact of democracy is **zero**]{.underline}
[**regardless** of how]{.underline} contractualist economy or
[interstate conflict is measured]{.underline}. There is no
misinterpreted interaction term in any study that has overturned the
democratic peace, and the disaggregation of the data yields no support
for a causal interaction of democracy with contractualist economy. Ray's
(2013) [evidence for reverse causality from democracy to contractualist
economy is shown to be based on an **erroneous research
design**]{.underline}. And of DOR's 120 separate regressions that
consider contractualist economy, 116 contain controversial measurement
and specification practices; the remaining four are analyses of all
(fatal and non-fatal) disputes, where the correlation of democracy with
peace is limited to mixedeconomic dyads, those where one state has a
contractualist economy and the other does not, a subset that includes
only 27% of dyads from 1951 to 2001, including only 50% of democratic
dyads. It is further shown that this [marginal peace is a **statistical
artifact** since it does not exist among neighbors where everyone has an
equal opportunity to fight.]{.underline} The [results]{.underline} of
this study should not be surprising, as they [merely corroborate the
present state of knowledge]{.underline}. This is because, while DOR
ardently assert that four alleged errors, when corrected, each
independently save the democratic peace proposition---multiple
imputation, the exclusion of ongoing dispute years, an interaction term,
and their alternative measure for contractualist economy---they never
actually report any clear-cut evidence in support of their claims. One
issue not addressed is Dafoe and Russett's (2013) challenge to Mousseau
et al. (2013a) on the grounds that our reported insignificance of
democracy is not significant. Like the four claims of error made by DOR
addressed here, Dafoe and Russett (2013) made this charge without
supporting it. Mousseau et al. (2013b) then investigated it and showed
that it too has no support. This issue appears resolved, as Russett and
colleagues (DOR) did not raise it again. Nor have DOR or anyone else
disputed the overturning of the democratic peace as reported in Mousseau
(2012a), which has not been contested with any assertion, supported or
unsupported. The [implications of this study are **far from
trivial**]{.underline}: [the observation of democratic peace is a
**statistical artifact**, seemingly explained by economic
conditions.]{.underline} If scientific knowledge progresses and the
field of interstate conflict processes is to abide by the scientific
rules of evidence, then [we must stop describing democracy as a
''known'' cause or correlate of peace, and **stop** tossing in a
variable for democracy, **willy-nilly**, in quantitative analyses of
international conflict;]{.underline} the variable to replace it is
contractualist economy. [If nations want to advance peace]{.underline}
abroad, the [promotion of democracy will not achieve it]{.underline}:
the policy to replace it is the promotion of economic opportunity The
economic norms account for how contractualist economy can cause both
democracy and peace has been explicated in numerous prior studies and
need not be repeated here (Mousseau, 2000, 2009, 2012a, 2013). An
abundance of prior studies have also corroborated various novel
predictions of the theory in wider domains (Ungerer, 2012), and no one
has disputed the multiple reports that contractualist economy is the
strongest non-trivial predictor of peace both within (Mousseau, 2012b)
and between nations (Mousseau, 2013; see also Nieman, 2015). The only
matter in controversy is whether democracy has any observable impact on
peace between nations after consideration of contractualist economy. My
investigation begins below with the allegation of measurement error.

#### Democracy does not breed peace\-\--equality and voting can't get rid of competing interests between states\-\--nationalism is another reason why the public could easily support a war

Daniel **Larison 12**, senior editor at The American Conservative,
"Democratic Peace Theory Is False," 04/17/2012, The American
Conservative //

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.
Regardless, [**[democratic peace theory draws broad conclusions from a
short period]{.mark}** in modern history]{.underline} with very few
cases before the 20th century. [[The core]{.mark} of democratic peace
theory as I understand it [is that]{.mark} democratic governments are
more accountable to their populations, and because [the people]{.mark}
will bear the costs of the war they [are going to be less willing to
support]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} policy. [This]{.mark} supposedly
[keeps]{.mark} democratic [states from waging wars]{.mark} against one
another because of the built-in electoral and institutional checks on
government power. One small problem with this is that [it is
rubbish]{.mark}]{.underline}. ¶ [[Democracies in antiquity
fought]{.mark} against one another. **Political [equality and voting do
not abolish conflicts of interest]{.mark} between competing states**.
[Democratic peace theory doesn't account for the effects of nationalist
and imperialist ideologies]{.mark} on the way democratic nations think
about war. Democratic nations that have professional armies to do the
fighting for them are often enthusiastic]{.underline} about overseas
wars. The Conservative-Unionist government that waged the South African
War (against two states with elected governments, I might add) enjoyed
great popular support and won a huge majority in the "Khaki" election
that followed. ¶ As long as it goes well and doesn't have too many
costs, [[war can be]{.mark} quite [popular]{.mark}, and even if the war
is costly it may still be popular if it is fought for nationalist
reasons]{.underline} that appeal to a majority of the public. [If the
public is whipped into thinking that there is an intolerable foreign
threat or if they believe that their country can gain something at
relatively low cost by going to war, the type of government they have
really is irrelevant]{.underline}. Unless a democratic public believes
that a military conflict will go badly for their military, they may be
ready to welcome the outbreak of a war that they expect to win. [Setting
aside the flaws and failures of U.S.-led democracy promotion for a
moment, the idea that reducing the number of non-democracies makes war
less likely is just fantasy. Clashing interests between states aren't
going away, and **[the more democratic states there are]{.mark} in the
world [the more likely it is that two or more]{.mark} of them
[will]{.mark} eventually [fight]{.mark}**]{.underline} one another.

### AT: Terrorism !! 

#### NATO counter-terrorism efforts are ineffective -- security issues persist in major cities 

**Colibasanu**, Geopolitical Futures' Chief Operating Officer, May 30,
20**17**

(Antonia, NATO's Diminishing Military Function,
https://geopoliticalfutures.com/natos-diminishing-military-function/)

[[The alliance's link to]{.mark} the national [interests of its]{.mark}
member [states is breaking]{.mark}]{.underline}, meaning that
[[discussions]{.mark} [on strategy]{.mark} [rarely take place within the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its [military [function is declining
because]{.mark} alliance [members no longer share]{.mark} a common
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline} as they once did. This is evident from
the way member states decide to buy new equipment and prioritize defense
spending. In an ideal world, the U.S. would like Europe's collective
military capability to equal at least 50 percent of U.S. military
capability. [[Washington would argue that it is unfair for]{.mark} the
[U.S. to account fo]{.mark}r more than [70 percent of]{.mark} NATO
members' [defense spending]{.mark} while [its g]{.mark}ross
[d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct [is]{.mark} only [48 percent
of]{.mark} their [combined GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S. President
Donald Trump has talked about his desire to see Europe increase its
contributions and capabilities. The Europeans, on the other hand, have
suggested that the fact that they spend less on defense should not be
interpreted as contributing less to the alliance. Each side has
presented the issue in its own way, focusing on how these statements
will play at home. [[NATO]{.mark} has moved its headquarters into a new
building in Brussels and that, along with these disagreements, seems to
signal that it [is shifting from being a]{.mark} primarily [military
alliance to a more political one]{.mark}]{.underline}. **Consensus Isn't
Possible**. NATO won't easily come to an agreement on defense spending
because each country faces a different geopolitical reality and
therefore has different needs when it comes to defense. They may be able
to settle on broad political statements but not on specific plans.
Portugal has different national interests than Romania -- and not only
will they disagree on the amount of money that they should be spending
on defense, but they will also have varying military priorities and
views on how to spend it. [The [alliance was created]{.mark} during the
Cold War, [when members shared an interest: protecting West]{.mark}ern
[Europe from]{.mark} the [Soviet threat]{.mark}. [Now, the alliance no
longer has a common enemy]{.mark}, and [so]{.mark} coming to [an
agreement on]{.mark} things like what [military]{.mark} equipment and
weapons are needed [is impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}. These countries
all face different levels of threats, which explains why defense
spending varies from state to state -- some members just don't see
defense as a priority. The [[lack of consensus is]{.mark} also apparent
[when it comes to]{.mark} the alliance's [counterterrorism
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}. During their meeting in Brussels,
[[NATO]{.mark} leaders [pledged to]{.mark} "do more to [fight
terrorism]{.mark},"]{.underline} which might seem like a promising sign.
[But [members]{.mark} have made this commitment and [failed to live up
to it many times]{.mark}. [After]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[9/11]{.mark}
attacks, the [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} administration
[[insisted]{.mark} that its [NATO]{.mark} allies [contribute to the U.S.
counterterrorism effort]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} [France and
Germany]{.mark}, along with Russia, [opposed the Iraq
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The first [Obama]{.mark} administration
[asked]{.mark} NATO [to increase]{.mark} its troop [commitments]{.mark}
in Afghanistan [to]{.mark} help [fight the Taliban]{.mark}. [But]{.mark}
with the exception of the United Kingdom and some Eastern European
countries such as Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and Albania,
[European allies rejected Obama's request]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since
9/11, the U.S. has seen its counterterrorism operations, including the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of NATO's collective defense
principle -- the idea that an attack on one member is an attack on all.
Though there are many reasons the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were
problematic, Trump's insistence that NATO members help in the fight
against terrorism shouldn't be a surprise. But [the [U.S. looks at
counterterrorism]{.mark} operations [different]{.mark}ly [than]{.mark}
the [Europeans]{.mark} do]{.underline}. [For the Europeans, their
priority is preventing terrorism in Europe, and [NATO can do little to
prevent terrorist attacks on the Continent]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: Cyber !!

#### No impact to cyber-terror \-\-- countermeasures, system patches, deterrence, and deferral. 

**Chuipka** Junior Policy Officer at Transport Canada 1/11/**17**

(https://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/35695)

These cases illustrate that [the threat from cyberterrorism
is]{.underline} real but can be **[vastly overstated]{.underline}**.
[Most of the damage or disruption caused by the cyber-attack was
**quickly undone**, therefore the **potential** threat could be
considerable but the **actual threat** is **significantly
lower**]{.underline}. [While **attrition** has proven to be the only
likely strategy that cyberterrorists could pursue, its overall
effectiveness is **unconvincing** and **counterterrorism measures**
could make it **even less effective**]{.underline}. [First,
cyberterrorism attacks are **unlikely** to be repeated as the
vulnerabilities from that specific attack are **patched** up, making
future threats of cyberterrorism less credible]{.underline}. [Second, if
a terrorist attempts to threaten cyberterrorism, governments can
immediately **search for vulnerabilities** and patch them, essentially
making the attack fail]{.underline} -- this may be easier said than done
in most cases though warning always provides the chance to gain an
advantage. In some cases [you can **simply go offline** since an
established connection is required for cyberterrorism to ultimately
work]{.underline}. Third, [Cyberterrorism is only possible because of
vulnerabilities, by **hardening systems** and **patching
vulnerabilities** -- the chances of cyberterrorism occurring is
**decreased**]{.underline}. [This is one of the ongoing efforts by
governments around the world]{.underline}. Fourth, it is also critical
that [governments are constantly **removing zero day vulnerabilities**
from the market to prevent terrorists from obtaining them]{.underline}
-- they are key in a successful surprise cyber-attack. Fifth, [if worst
comes to worst and a cyber-attack has proven successful, one of the most
effective strategies against cyber-terrorism is **simply
deny**]{.underline}ing [that the event was caused by
terrorism]{.underline}. [Regardless of a terrorist organizations claim,
if the cyber-attack is **downplayed** by governments as **just a
"glitch"** in the system, it can **take away** the desired impact of
terrorists and **deter** future attempts at cyberterrorism]{.underline}.
[Even if a terrorist successfully conducted a cyber-attack and claimed
to be the perpetrators, cyberattacks have yet to demonstrate they can
actually cause terror -- an essential element for a terrorist attack to
be considered a success]{.underline}. [Given that high-level
cyber-attacks capable of being violent **requires** **vast resources**,
**intelligence**, **skill**, and **time** -- ultimately **too much can
go wrong** in conducting a cyber-attack and the **costs-benefit
analysis** weighs heavily towards terrorist use of kinetic weapons for
the time being]{.underline}.

#### Cyber-attacks won't escalate

**Gudgel 16**\-\--Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy with a Focus on U.S.
Cybersecurity Policy

\[John E. Gudgel, "Cyber War versus Cyber Realities: Cyber Conflict in
the International System" *Small Wars & Insurgencies*, Taylor and
Francis Group, Date Accessed: 4-16-17\]

[Valeriano and Maness view cyber conflict through the **lens of
international relations**]{.underline} [and primarily focus on cyber
interactions among states and directed towards states in the **realm of
foreign policy**.]{.underline} They argue: 'while cyberspace is a
separate domain, it is not unconnected from the normal political domain
that is the genesis of conflicts' (p. 15). Following an introductory
chapter outlining the contours of the cyber conflict world, eight
subsequent chapters build and defend their theoretical framework for the
analysis and prediction of cyber conflict in the international system.
One of their major conclusions is that ['cyber conflict has not changed
**how states operate**, it has not led to a revolution in **military
affairs**, and the fears associated with the tactic are
overblown']{.underline} (p. 209). A key component of the authors'
framework described in Chapter 3 is their **[Theory of Cyber
Restraint]{.underline}** that holds that [due to fears of collateral
damage, blowback, and replication states will **restrain themselves**
from unleashing the **full weight of their cyber
capabilities**.]{.underline} In delineating this theory, Valeriano and
Maness stake out a clear middle path between authors such as Richard
Clarke and Robert Knake who believe that cyber war has already begun,2
and Thomas Rid who contends that cyber war will never take place.3 They
frame their approach as cyber moderation: the concept that cyber
conflict will occur, but that the conflicts themselves will be trivial
and will not significantly change state behavior (p. 39). From their
theory and approach, they then propose nine hypotheses on interstate
cyber interactions. One of the primary contributions [of the authors'
research is the construction of an **open source** and **peer-vetted
database** of cyber incidents and disputes]{.underline} between
countries called the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset (DCID).
The 1.0 version of the dataset currently contains 111 cyber incidents
(defined as short-term isolated cyber operations) and 45 cyber disputes
(defined as longer-term operations that can contain several incidents)
between state-to-state rivals over an 11-year period (2001 to 2011)
including 21 cyber incidents and 5 cyber disputes between China and the
United States. In creating this dataset, the authors recognized the
attribution problem and only included incidents and disputes where
state-based involvement was explicit and evident (p. 84). Using this
dataset, Valeriano and Maness in Chapters 4 and 5 quantitatively analyze
interstate cyber actions including the 'scope, length, and damage
inflicted by cyber disputes among rival states' (p. 78) from 2001 to
2011. Some of the research questions they address include: What factors
might predict the occurrence, targets, and level of severity in cyber
conflict between states? What are the foreign policy implications of
cyber conflict? Do cyber incidents influence and lead to more
conflictual relations? What they found was 'that [the **actual
magnitude** and **pace** of cyber disputes among rivals **do not match
popular perception**]{.underline}; only 20 of 126 active rivals have
engaged in cyber conflict, and their interactions have been limited in
terms of magnitude and frequency' (p. 18). Further, they found that
[**most cyber incidents** are regional]{.underline} (e.g.
India--Pakistan), [focused predominately on **espionage** and
**low-level DDoS attacks**, and were largely ineffective in getting
states to **change behavior**. There was also little evidence of
state-supported or sponsored groups utilizing **cyber terrorism**. They
back up their **quantitative data** with a series of **case
studies**]{.underline} looking at the most significant recent cyber
conflicts involving state (Chapter 6) and non-state (Chapter 7) actors.
They then propose a system of rules and norms in cyberspace based on the
Just War tradition (Chapter 8).

### AT: Heg !! -- No Erosion 

#### Despite Trump's current deviations, *[deep structures]{.underline}* prevent *[erosion of hegemony]{.underline}*

**Stokes,** PhD, **18** (Doug, Professor in International Security and
Strategy in the Department of Politics at the University of Exeter,
International Affairs, 94:1)//EF

Second, the article argues that [while system maintenance costs are
rising, and the United States is in the throes of a slow relative
decline, **the US remains a structurally advantaged** hegemon in a
number of very important areas.]{.underline} [These include the
continued use of the dollar as a global reserve currency; the global
security regimes in which it predominates, which provide it with
leverage over other states' geopolitical and economic choices; and the
still overwhelming command capacity of the American economy, most
notably in its continued preponderance in global foreign direct
investment (FDI).]{.underline} As such, its postwar globalist grand
strategy of deep engagement continues to make rational sense, not least
as it gives the US leverage over the international regimes it
underwrites. [A reversal of this grand strategy would undermine not only
this leverage but also, I argue, the world economic order, which remains
centred on America. **It is thus highly unlikely that the agency of
Trump will overcome the deep structures and path dependencies that
incline towards systemic maintenance**]{.underline}. Although it is hard
to predict how far Trump will seek to deviate from the postwar norm, or
how much damage his learning curve will inflict on US leadership**[, it
is likely that once his term is over, American elites will seek to 'snap
back' to the status quo ante, given the goods the United States still
derives from its hegemony.]{.underline}**

### AT: Heg !! -- Dead Already 

#### US hegemony is already over -- NATO can't shift the state of affairs 

**Ischinger**, German diplomat, **18** Wolfgang,
<https://www.securityconference.de/en/news/article/food-for-thought-donald-trump-and-the-end-of-americas-benign-hegemony/>

For Atlanticists in Europe who still think we shouldn\'t give up on the
United States, the loss of John McCain has been particularly painful.
All his life, the US Senator was a staunch defender of the transatlantic
partnership -- and particularly so since Trump came to power. [At the
Munich Security Conference in 2017, McCain had called on Europeans not
to count America out and to keep investing in the transatlantic bond.
McCain\'s words remain of utmost importance. Yet, they cannot obscure
the fact that the liberal hegemon]{.underline} -- the hegemon Europe had
relied on for decades -- belongs to the past. This became particularly
evident in the beginning of July, [when President Trump almost wrecked a
NATO summit, offended the hosts of his visit to Britain, and called the
European Union a \"foe\" of the United States, all the while cozying up
to Vladimir Putin, a \"good competitor.\"]{.underline} For months,
Europeans concerned about the president's statements have been reassured
by American friends: Ignore the tweets, focus on what the administration
does, and trust our checks and balances. That made some sense. Senior
cabinet members like the secretary of defense have remained committed to
the liberal international order and to America\'s alliances and
partnerships. Congress has strongly supported NATO. And American troops
still guarantee Europe\'s security. But in international relations,
it\'s not only deeds that matter; words also do, especially the American
president\'s. Let's face it: Mr. Trump\'s core beliefs conflict with the
foundations of Western grand strategy since the mid-1940s. [He believes
America is getting a bad deal from its European allies. He expresses
admiration for autocrats like Kim Jong-un and Mr. Putin,]{.underline}
while reserving his most acidic comments for democratic partners like
Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada\'s Justin Trudeau. He represents the
opposite of liberal internationalism. That sends Europe a sad message:
[The era of America\'s benign hegemony may be over, with Europe
extremely ill prepared]{.underline}. On July 11 and 12, Mr. Trump
undercut a NATO summit that was yielding results: reaffirming a goal for
members to strengthen the alliance by spending 2 percent of their gross
domestic product on the military by 2024. While European military
spending has been rising for some time, Mr. Trump was correct in saying
that some members, including Germany, aren't doing enough. He also has
legitimate concerns about trade imbalances. Still, his
mischaracterization of the goal as \"dues\" owed to America makes it
harder for European leaders to ask their voters for increased military
spending. And his bullying comments led Europeans to suspect he might be
more interested in leaving the alliance than in leading it. Such implied
threats attack the foundation of the alliance: the idea of solidarity
and commitment to one another\'s security. [Americans tell us Mr. Trump
can\'t leave NATO without Senate consent --- a debatable notion that
misses the point. Any doubt about America's commitment hurts the
credibility of NATO\'s deterrence]{.underline}. That is what makes Mr.
Trump\'s statements so dangerous. They may extract a few billion dollars
for defense spending, but they destroy the assurances that those dollars
--- or euros --- are meant to bolster. Those uncertainties were
magnified by the president's bizarre appearance with Mr. Putin in
Helsinki, Finland, right after the NATO Summit. Mr. Trump in effect
disavowed his own intelligence community. He failed to declare Russian
meddling in Western democracies unacceptable. If Mr. Putin does not feel
emboldened now, when will he? Who will now believe that interfering in
democratic elections comes at a price? Mr. Trump\'s performance seemed
to indicate that America is ready to give up its ambition to be the free
world\'s respected leader. That was painful for America\'s European
friends and allies to watch. Throughout the Trump presidency, we have
tried to preserve a close partnership with America, influence the Trump
administration and safeguard European interests. It hasn\'t worked. Mr.
Trump ignored our concerns by leaving the Paris climate pact and the
Iran nuclear deal, and he slapped tariffs on his closest allies. Why,
then, should Europeans consider this administration a trustworthy
partner? A recent ZDF Politbarometer poll found that only 9 percent of
Germans do. But there is no realistic Plan B yet, posing a conundrum:
Europeans cannot simply go it alone, but we must prepare to be left
alone. So we must develop a Plan B. Duck and cover will not suffice.
First, Europe needs a dual-track approach. We should strengthen our
military readiness and decision-making capacity while showing the White
House more clearly that its actions have costs for America. We also must
address some of Mr. Trump's justified concerns, like increasing military
spending --- but in our own interest, rather than to please him. We
should also offer to work closely with those Americans -- Americans like
John McCain -- who believe that a strong partnership with Europe remains
in America\'s best interest. Europeans need to engage, engage, engage:
with Congress, with governors, with America's business community and
civil society. But can we rely on the American system of government to
work as promised? Now is the time to check and balance! At the risk of
\"meddling\": Are there Republican senators willing to refuse to vote
for any Trump appointee unless he stops denigrating his own intelligence
community? Security should not be an issue that pits the United States
against Europe. Many Western societies are divided between those who
believe in preserving the post-World War II order and those who would
replace it with 19th-century nationalism. Europeans who believe that
abandoning the Western liberal order would be an extraordinary act of
stupidity must step up our game. But we won't succeed without strong
support from like-minded friends across the Atlantic. American patriots,
will you work with us?

### AT: Disease !! -- NATO Bad 

#### NATO causes famine and disease -- North Africa proves, fueling the war

[Despite living in a time where there is a global surplus of food,
[millions]{.mark} of people around the world [are still suffering from
famine]{.mark}]{.underline}. If you follow [mainstream
[media]{.mark}]{.underline} coverage about these humanitarian disasters,
they're most likely [[presented through the lens of climate
change]{.mark}, [high food prices and taxes]{.mark}.]{.underline} But in
places like Yemen, South Sudan, the Lake Chad basin of West Africa and
Somalia, where images of skeletal children have become commonplace
several countries in Africa and the Middle East, [it is perhaps no
coincidence that the epidemic of [famine is]{.mark} directly [linked
to]{.mark} modern-day [colonialism and imperialism led by the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is in this part of the world
where [resource exploitation]{.mark}, the [war on terror]{.mark},
military [occupation and destabilization combine to create one of
the most dire]{.mark} humanitarian [crises of the modern
era]{.mark}.]{.underline} While environmental factors do play a role,
[[policies set by]{.mark} powerful oil companies and [state
actors]{.mark} have [created and reinforced the present
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Somalia, where the U.S. has
been waging a covert drone war, people have become accustomed to famine.
In a span of just one year, [between 2011 and 2012, over 260,000 people
died]{.underline}, [half of them under the age of 5, marking the worst
famine in the last 25 years]{.underline}. According to data from
Somalia's Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU), [[4.6
percent of the]{.mark} total [population]{.mark} and 10 percent of
children under 5 [died in]{.mark} southern and central [Somalia
alone]{.mark}]{.underline}. The organization Somalia's Food Security and
Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) found that ["the [result was]{.mark}
widespread [livestock deaths]{.mark}, the smallest cereal harvest since
the 1991-94 civil war, [and a]{.mark} major [drop in labor
demand]{.mark}, which reduced household income."]{.underline}
[[Compounding]{.mark} environmental [burdens were]{.mark} the wider
[impacts of British colonialism]{.mark} in Somalia, [as well as U.S.
militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the United States plundered
Somalia for resources by way of mineral excavation and so-called oil
exploration, past and present administrations have also applied their
full military might. [[In 1993]{.mark}, during the Clinton presidency,
[images of famine]{.mark} and war [were used to convince Americans
that]{.mark} U.S. military [efforts were necessary]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"We went \[to Somalia\] because only the United States could help stop
one of the great human tragedies of this time," Clinton said. "In a
sense, we came to Somalia to rescue innocent people in a burning house."
[What Bill [Clinton didn't disclose]{.mark} was [that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [was one of the reasons]{.mark} why [the house was on
fire to begin with]{.mark}, and military [efforts would]{.mark} [not
help]{.mark} to put out the flames.]{.underline}

### AT: Disease !! -- No Impact 

#### Disease doesn't cause extinction -- empirics, vaccines, adaptation 

**Adalja**, an infectious-disease physician at the University of
Pittsburgh, 6/17/**16** (Amesh,
<https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/>)

no disease "You'll tell us when you're worried, right?" That was the
question posed to me countless times at the height of the 2014 West
African Ebola outbreak. As an infectious disease physician, I was
interviewed on outlets such as CNN, NPR, and Fox News about the dangers
of the virus, and the answer I gave was always the same: "Ebola is a
deadly, scary disease, but it is not that contagious. It will not find
the U.S. or other industrialized nations hospitable." In other words,
no, I wasn't worried---and not because I have a rosy outlook on
infectious diseases. [I'm well-aware of the damage these diseases are
causing around the world]{.underline}: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis; the
influenza pandemic that took the world by surprise in 2009; the
anti-vaccine movement bumping cases of measles to an all-time
post-vaccine-era high; antibiotic-resistant bacteria threatening to
collapse the entire structure of modern medicine---[all these, like
Ebola, are continuously placing an enormous number of lives at risk. But
when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives]{.underline}; they're
asking about the threat to human life. With each outbreak of a
headline-grabbing emerging infectious disease comes a fear of extinction
itself. The fear envisions a large proportion of humans succumbing to
infection, leaving no survivors or so few that the species can't be
sustained. [I'm not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario, but I do
understand the impulse. Worry about the end is a quintessentially human
trait. Thankfully, so is our resilience. For most of mankind's history,
infectious diseases were the existential threat to
humanity]{.underline}---and for good reason. They were quite successful
at killing people: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out an
estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century Black
Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5
percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half of all
humans who have ever lived. Any yet, of course, humanity continued to
flourish. [Our species' recent explosion in lifespan is almost
exclusively the result of the control of infectious diseases through
sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial therapies]{.underline}. Only
in the modern era, in which many infectious diseases have been tamed in
the industrial world, do people have the luxury of death from cancer,
heart disease, or stroke in the 8th decade of life. Childhoods are free
from watching siblings and friends die from outbreaks of typhoid,
scarlet fever, smallpox, measles, and the like. So what would it take
for a disease to wipe out humanity now? In Michael Crichton's The
Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the disease-outbreak genre, an
alien microbe threatens the human race with extinction, and humanity's
best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy organism. Fortunately,
outside of fiction, there's no reason to expect alien pathogens to wage
war on the human race any time soon, and my analysis suggests that any
real-life domestic microbe reaching an extinction level of threat
probably is just as unlikely. [Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to
possess a very special combination of two attributes. First, it would
have to be so unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be
applied to it. Second, it would need to have a high and surreptitious
transmissibility before symptoms occur.]{.underline} The first is
essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens would, by
definition, have family members that could serve as models for
containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical
disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute
clinicians. [The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level threats in the world today---influenza, HIV, and
Ebola---don't meet these two requirements. Influenza, for
instance]{.underline}, despite its well-established ability to kill on a
large scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and
drift away from our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known
unknown." While there are many mysteries about how new flu strains
emerge, from at least the time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned
to its risk. And in the modern era, [a full-fledged industry of
influenza preparedness exists, with effective vaccine strategies and
antiviral therapies.]{.underline} HIV, which has killed 39 million
people over several decades, is similarly limited due to several
factors. Most importantly, HIV's dependency on blood and body fluid for
transmission (similar to Ebola) requires intimate human-to-human
contact, which limits contagion. [Highly potent antiviral therapy allows
most people to live normally with the disease, and a substantial group
of the population has genetic mutations that render them impervious to
infection in the first place]{.underline}. Lastly, simple prevention
strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users and barrier
contraceptives---when available---can curtail transmission risk. Ebola,
for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several others, also
falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact that it
spreads almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable
symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality
rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three, every other known
disease falls short of what seems required to wipe out humans---which
is, of course, why we're still here. And it's not that diseases are
ineffective. On the contrary, diseases' failure to knock us out is a
testament to just how resilient humans are. [Part of our evolutionary
heritage is our immune system, one of the most complex on the planet,
even without the benefit of vaccines or the helping hand of
antimicrobial drugs.]{.underline} This system, when viewed at a species
level, can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable. Coupled to genetic
variations amongst humans---which open up the possibility for a range of
advantages, from imperviousness to infection to a tendency for mild
symptoms---[this adaptability ensures that almost any infectious disease
onslaught will leave a large proportion of the population alive to
rebuild]{.underline}, in contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions.
While the immune system's role can never be understated, an even more
powerful protector is the faculty of consciousness. Humans are not the
most prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet,
but as Aristotle identified, humans are the rational animals---and it is
this fundamental distinguishing characteristic that allows humans to
form abstractions, think in principles, and plan long-range. These
capacities, in turn, allow humans to modify, alter, and improve
themselves and their environments. Consciousness equips us, at an
individual and a species level, to make nature safe for the species
through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines,
and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the problems
posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and
short. In many ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases'
worthiest adversary. None of this is meant to allay all fears of
infectious diseases. To totally adopt a Panglossian viewpoint would be
foolish---and dangerous. Humans do face countless threats from
infectious diseases: witness Zika. And if not handled appropriately,
severe calamity could, and will, ensue. The West African Ebola outbreak,
for instance, festered for months before major efforts to bring it under
control were initiated. When it comes to infectious diseases, I'm
worried about the failure of institutions to understand the full impact
of outbreaks. I'm worried about countries that don't have the
infrastructure or resources to combat these outbreaks when they come.
But as long as we can keep adapting, I'm not worried about the future of
the human race.

But mostly **[diseases don\'t drive species extinct.]{.underline}**
**[There are]{.underline}** **[several reasons]{.underline}** for that.
For one, **[the most dangerous diseases are those that spread from one
individual to another. If the disease is highly lethal]{.underline}**,
then **[the population drops, and it becomes]{.underline}** **[less
likely that individuals will contact each other]{.underline}** during
the infectious phase. **[Highly contagious diseases tend to
burn]{.underline}** themselves **[out]{.underline}** that way.¶ Probably
**[the main reason is variation.]{.underline}** Within the host and the
pathogen population there will be a wide range of variants. **[Some
hosts may be naturally resistant.]{.underline}** **[Some pathogens will
be less virulent]{.underline}**. And either alone or **[in
combination]{.underline}**, you end up with **[infected
individuals]{.underline}** who **[survive]{.underline}**.¶ We see this
in HIV, for example. There is a small fraction of humans who are
naturally resistant or altogether immune to HIV, either because of their
CCR5 allele or their MHC Class I type. And there are a handful of people
who were infected with defective versions of HIV that didn\'t progress
to disease. ¶ We can see indications of this sort of thing happening in
the past, because our genomes contain **[many]{.underline}** instances
of **[pathogen resistance genes]{.underline}** that
**[have]{.underline}** **[spread through the whole
population.]{.underline}** **[Those]{.underline}** all started off as
rare mutations that **[conferred a strong selection advantage to the
carriers,]{.underline}** meaning that the specific infectious diseases
were serious threats to the species.

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, [there are]{.underline} some
[reasons to believe that]{.underline} **[natural pandemics are very
unlikely to cause human extinction.]{.underline}** Analysis of the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list database
has shown that [of the 833 recorded plant and animal species extinctions
known to have occurred since 1500, less than 4% (31 species) were
ascribed to infectious disease]{.underline}.38 [None of the mammals and
amphibians on this list were globally dispersed, and other factors aside
from infectious disease also contributed to their
extinction]{.underline}. It therefore seems that **[our own species,
which is very numerous, globally dispersed, and capable of a rational
response to problems, is very unlikely to be killed off by a natural
pandemic.]{.underline}** One underlying explanation for this is that
**[highly lethal pathogens can kill their hosts before they have a
chance to spread, so there is a selective pressure for pathogens not to
be highly lethal.]{.underline}** Therefore, [pathogens are likely to
co-evolve with their hosts rather than kill all possible
hosts]{.underline}.39

### AT: Climate Change !! 

#### NATO can't solve climate change -- they don't view it as a immediate challenge.

**Fetzek**, Senior Fellow for International Affairs, 06/09/**16**

(Shiloh,
https://climateandsecurity.org/2016/06/09/nato-secretary-general-climate-change-is-also-a-security-threat/)

In advance of the NATO Summit Warsaw in July, the Secretary General of
NATO Jens Stoltenberg sat down for an interview with POLITICO Europe.
[When asked what NATO is doing to address the risks of climate change,
he responded by asserting that climate change is in fact a security
risk, and an issue to consider in the context of conflict prevention,
peace and stability. He also noted that NATO does not have the luxury of
choosing the challenges it faces]{.underline}, and has to work to adapt
to the changing security environment. Indeed, the challenges that NATO
faces are serious and climate change, particularly if not adequately
addressed by NATO member states, could very well multiply those
challenges and ultimately challenge the NATO mission. However, though
[the Secretary General appreciated the risks of climate change to NATO's
security landscape, he unfortunately stopped short of describing it as a
priority of his.]{.underline} From the interview: Alice Stollmeyer:
"Last year head of the UN Climate Summit in Paris NATO has stated that
climate change poses significant threat multipliers and I was wondering
could you tell us what NATO is doing to address this and how to, amid
all the other crisis, to keep the climate security threats on the
agenda?" Secretary General Stoltenberg: "First of all, I think it is
very important to underline what you just said and that is climate
change is also a security threat because it can really change also the
conditions for where people live, create new migrant and refugee crises
and scarce resources, water, can fuel new conflicts. So climate change
is also about preventing conflicts and creating more stability and
prosperity, which is good for peace and stability. Second, NATO is
addressing how we can also address, how we can contribute. [**NATO is
not the first responder to climate change**. We are a military
alliance]{.underline}, but partly everything that can make also military
vehicles, military equipment more energy efficient will be good both for
the environment but also for the sustainability of the armed forces. So
energy efficiency, less energy dependence of the armed forces is good
for both the armed forces as armed forces and for the environment. And
that's actually the thing we can do as an alliance. We are also sharing
this information with allies, trying to increase their focus and
understanding of this, but of course the most important things that can
be done with climate change is more related to energy, to ministers of
the environment, to other areas than defense." (57:18 min mark) The
Secretary General rightly notes that climate change multiplies threats
to the security environment, and that [addressing climate risks can
increase peace and stability]{.underline}. It is critically important
for someone in his position, as the civilian head of the largest
military alliance in the world during a time of significant instability,
to acknowledge this. However, [that assessment seems to be contradicted
by his statement "climate change is more related to energy, to ministers
of the environment, to other areas than defense."]{.underline} [If
indeed climate change is a security risk, and a factor to consider in
conflict prevention and state stability, tasking only "ministers of
environment" to address those risks seems insufficient.]{.underline}
[Addressing security issues, particularly complex transnational ones
like climate change, requires a whole of government approach, including
defense and foreign ministries]{.underline} (as well as those
responsible for environment, energy and development). Indeed, this is
something the US Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State, and many
NATO member state governments, have recognized. Nevertheless, the
Secretary General is right to focus on the extraordinary challenges
facing the alliance at this moment in history. As he says: I will call
it a landmark summit and I will call it one of the most important
summits in the history of NATO because we are faced with such a
fundamentally changed security environment. Of course, [**NATO is
dealing with** significant and **immediate challenges** on its doorstep,
most notably Russia's revanchist actions in Ukraine, the turmoil in
Syria and the broader Mediterranean, hybrid warfare, and terrorist
attacks within NATO member states, **which** may understandably diminish
**attention to perceived longer term**, non-state based **risks like
climate change**.]{.underline} As Stoltenberg states: All of this has
really made the security environment which we are faced with so much
more challenging and in many ways more dangerous and therefore NATO has
to respond. And we have started that adaptation but we have to make new,
important decisions at the summit in Warsaw, making sure that NATO
changes, NATO adapts when the world around us is changing and that is
what we are going to do at Warsaw. However, it's important to note that
climate change is not necessarily distinct from these other security
risks, but rather, an important factor placing strains on the broader
security environment in which these risks play out. Climate change will
multiply stress on factors related to peace and state stability, such as
water, energy, food, and migration, all of which are key elements of
instability in NATO's backyard. As NATO changes and adapts, how climate
change will challenge NATO's core missions should be a priority. As the
Secretary General continues to help steer the NATO alliance, it will be
important for him to connect these dots, as history will likely not be
kind to a historic summit that fails to do so. His own advice is
pertinent in this context: We don't have the luxury of choosing between
either addressing the challenges we see to the east, or the threat and
the challenges we see to the south. We have to do both at the same time.
And that's exactly what we are doing. To appropriate an American
colloquialism, Stoltenberg is essentially saying that NATO has to "walk
and chew gum at the same time." That's exactly right. However, without
significantly and concretely addressing core issues shaping that
security environment, such as climate change, NATO will be left
unprepared. For a few ideas from the Center for Climate and Security on
some actions NATO could take in this regards, see here. Also stay tuned
for a forthcoming report on the state of NATO preparedness for a
changing climate.

#### Changing climate change approaches must start at the level of national governments -- not NATO 

**Lippert**, Ph.D. from the RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, **16**

(Tyler H. NATO, Climate Change, and International Security: A Risk
Governance Approach, 81)

[Closer integration at the international level of disaster risk
reduction and climate change adaptation, and the mainstreaming of both
into international development and development assistance,]{.underline}
could foster efficiency in the use of available and committed resources
and capacity (high confidence). Neither disaster risk reduction nor
climate change adaptation is as well integrated as they could be into
current development policies and practices. Both climate change
adaptation and disaster risk reduction might benefit from sharing of
knowledge and experience in a mutually supportive and synergistic way.
[Climate change adaptation could be factored into all disaster risk
management, and weather-related disasters are becoming an essential
component of the adaptation agenda.332 Yet the burden of responsibility
to act in this domain, particularly as it concerns disaster response and
migration issues, does not fall exclusively on NATO. National
governments, and other international organizations, have more immediate
responsibility than NATO.]{.underline} But the division of labor is not
well delineated, and certain circumstances would require NATO to play a
more immediate and substantive role. Disaster response and humanitarian
assistance (DR/HA) is a longstanding function of NATO. That NATO is not
necessarily the first responder in this respect has the potential to
obstruct and obscure the perspective of member states. They may, for
instance, not view the issue of disaster response and humanitarian
assistance in a uniform manner. And this, in turn, influences, and
potentially muddles, the level of responsibility for NATO to absorb.

### 2AC -- German Recession 

#### Trump's been pushing for more NATO defense spending -- consultations viewed a concession to get what he wants -- its traded for an increase in German spending

**Harding**, Guardian foreign correspondent, **18** (Luke, 07.12.18,
"Could Trump pull US out of Nato and what would happen if he did?"
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/trump-nato-threat-withdraw-what-would-happen)>
np

[[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has
come close to suggesting the US might unilaterally withdraw from Nato if
other member states fail to dramatically increase their spending on the
military bloc.]{.underline} According to diplomats, [he plunged the
[Nato](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato) summit into chaos on
Thursday by saying the US would "go it alone" if European states failed
to boost their spending to at least 2% of GDP by January. At an
emergency press conference later, [Trump appeared to row
back](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/donald-trump-nato-summit-chaos-germany-attack-defence-spending)
from this threat,]{.underline} claiming Nato members had agreed to
commit an extra \$33bn (£25bn). He said it had been "a little tough for
a little while" and he had told the Europeans he would be "very unhappy"
if they did not up their spending "substantially". But he said a
"tremendous amount of progress" had been made. Nato was now "much
stronger", he added, with spending "rocketing" upwards. Could Trump
withdraw the US from Nato? Trump appeared to suggest he had the power to
withdraw the US from Nato without the approval of the US Congress. In
fact, the organisation was established by a formal and binding treaty,
which means Trump cannot use his executive power to pull America out of
the alliance, in contrast to other international agreements such as the
[Iran nuclear
deal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement)
or the [Paris climate
agreement](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-confirms-us-will-quit-paris-climate-deal),
both of which Trump has withdrawn from. The existing funding target --
2% of GDP -- is only being met or exceeded by five of Nato\'s 29
countries, according to newly published figures. They are: the US on
3.6%, Greece on 2.2%, Estonia 2.14%, the UK 2.10%, and Poland on 2%.
France currently spends 1.8% and Germany 1.2%. The escalating costs of
defence are well known. To build an aircraft carrier, a 21st century
fighter jet or a cyber unit capable of defeating Russian attacks is
rising at a rate much faster than average inflation. British defence
secretary Gavin Williamson has [identified a £20bn
shortfall](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/21/williamson-losing-fight-with-treasury-for-rise-in-defence-spending)
in funding over the next 10 years. Without that money, he will need to
make further cuts in annual running costs. President Emmanuel Macron,
who lopped €650m off the French defence budget last year and sacked his
military chief for complaining about it, [has promised to boost spending
to 2% by
2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/08/france-boost-defence-spending-unprecedented-move-meet-nato-commitments/),
five years earlier than Germany. Where would the money come from?
Britain and France have global ambitions, but run budget deficits. That
means any extra spending must come from extra borrowing, higher taxes or
cuts to other departments. As Trump has pointed out, Germany currently
runs a budget surplus and could increase its defence spending to 2% --
but doubling it to 4% would be a very long shot. Trump would normally
first need to win approval in the Senate and to persuade Republican
senators that the move is necessary and in the US's long-term security
interests. Unsurprisingly, Trump's apparent threat caused dismay on
Thursday among European allies. There is no certainty it would attract
support in Washington from leading Republicans. What would the
consequences be? Leaving Nato would be a seismic step, previously
unthinkable, that would shake up a western alliance that has endured for
more than 70 years. It would also be a boon to Russia and its leader,
Vladimir Putin, whom Trump will meet on Monday in Helsinki. Ultimately,
a decision by the White House to abandon Nato could be challenged
legally and end up in the US supreme court. Trump now has a majority in
the court and is likely to succeed in winning approval for his
[conservative
nominee](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jul/09/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-justice-trump-pick),
Brett Kavanaugh. [For now it appears that Trump's threat is just that.
In more emollient tones, Trump claimed on Thursday that the US's
commitment to Nato was "very strong and "remains very strong" following
negotiations. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, is now left
with a headache: what to do if Trump returns to this theme of departure
and how might the alliance survive were America really to
leave?]{.underline}

#### German debt is high now -- increasing defense spending ensures economic decline

**Tigner**, reporter @ Atlantic Council, **19** (Brooks, 02.13.19, "Can
Germany Stay the Course on Defense Spending?"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/can-germany-stay-the-course-on-defense-spending)>
np

[Germany's defense budget is on the march upwards, but can Berlin
maintain the spending momentum given the prospects of a slowing global
economy?]{.underline} There are also questions about how the country
should spend its defense euros in the long term, say defense officials
and policy experts. [Germany has long been an underspender when it comes
to meeting NATO's defense budget guideline of 2 percent of
GDP]{.underline} for each of its allies, but that is now changing.
[Since the allies' collective pledge]{.underline} at their 2014 Wales
Summit to march toward 2 percent by 2024 [Berlin has repeatedly
acknowledged that it won't make 2 percent by 2024.]{.underline} But it
has committed to reaching 1.5 percent of GDP for defense by then. So
far, the Wales pledge has been working. NATO estimates that the European
allies plus Canada have spent \$41 billion more on defense since 2016,
and will have spent \$100 billion more by the end of 2020 compared to
the same year. By 2024 they will have spent \$350 billion more, the
Alliance says. [As for Germany, Berlin has steadily raised defense
spending from 1.18 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.24 percent in
2018.]{.underline} Moreover, its draft defense budget for 2019 proposes
€41.54 billion, a €3 billion year-on-year increase. [Whether this
orderly stair-step progress to 1.5 percent will be smooth sailing is
another matter. Germany's economy is slowing and, along with it, its tax
revenues. Recent press reports cite finance ministry documents that
point to an overall government budget shortfall of nearly €25
billion]{.underline} from now through 2023, [with possible implications
for Germany's carefully planned defense spending increases.]{.underline}
The final numbers and their implications won't emerge until the end of
March. Despite the risk of lower increases to its defense budget,
Germany still aims to make that 1.5 percent target, according to one
German defense policy official. "We are still working on our 2020 budget
and our perspective to 2023, and what this means in concrete terms is
still under discussion," the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said on February 12. "But we have reaffirmed \[to NATO\] our
intention to spend 1.5 \[percent\] by 2024." [So could Germany's defense
budget be ring-fenced from the impact of a wider government budget
shortfall?]{.underline} "I can't say, but if we want to reach our 1.5
percent goal, then we will need steady increases in defense spending,"
is all the official would say.

potential risks associated with **stolen or loose WMD**]{.underline},
[resulting from poor security, can also pose a threat to U.S. national

show how [financial constraints affect weapons security making weapons
vulnerable to theft, and how financial factors can influence WMD
proliferation]{.underline} by contributing to the motivating factors
behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons technology. The
[inherent vulnerabilities within the global financial markets will
provide terrorists' organizations and other non-state
groups]{.underline}, who object to the current international system or
distribution of power, [with opportunities to disrupt global finance and
perhaps weaken America's status]{.underline}. A more ominous threat
originates from states intent on increasing diversification of foreign
currency holdings, establishing alternatives to the dollar for
international trade, or engaging financial warfare against the United
States.

### \-\-- XT: German Recession 

#### German economies suffering now -- further decline will cause a European recession

**Ewing**, reporter @ New York Times, **18** (jack, 11.14.18, "German
Economy Shrinks Unexpectedly, Adding to Europe's Risk,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/business/german-economy-shrinks.html)>

BRUSSELS --- [Germany's once unstoppable economy has gone into reverse,
adding another threat to European stability]{.underline} just as Italy
escalated its dispute with fiscal overseers in Brussels. The European
Union's bedrock economy unexpectedly shrank 0.2 percent in July through
September compared with the previous quarter, according to [data
published
Wednesday](https://www.destatis.de/EN/PressServices/Press/pr/2018/11/PE18_440_811.html;jsessionid=7DEBD293EBEAFC6979FFC0F963F19523.InternetLive2)
by Germany's official statistics agency. It was the first quarterly
contraction since 2015, with a drop in exports suggesting the stall was
a manifestation of President Trump's trade war with China. [If the
quarterly decline in Germany signaled a trend]{.underline} --- which
some economists doubted --- [the implications for the rest of Europe
would be ominous at a time when Italy is rattling financial
market]{.underline}s. Italy's populist government, which faced a
deadline Tuesday to resubmit a national budget earlier rejected by the
European Commission, made only minor concessions. The commission, the
European Union's executive arm, is expected to respond next week. [As
Europe faces a confluence of economic and political turbulence, Germany
and its powerful auto and machinery exporters have provided crucial
stability]{.underline}. [Without Germany as a locomotive, Europe would
have much more trouble withstanding shocks that, in addition to Italy,
include Britain's messy separation from the European Union and trade
tensions with the United States. Economists expressed hope that Germany
could bounce back quickly from the surprise decline in output, which was
caused in part by temporary production backlogs at
automakers]{.underline}. All of the major carmakers have struggled to
adjust to new, more rigorous European emissions testing procedures.
Germany's Federal Statistical Office blamed the setback on reduced
exports. China is an important customer for Mercedes-Benzes, Volkswagens
and BMWs as well as German-made factory machinery. But China has been
buying fewer German goods because its economy has suffered from tariffs
imposed by the United States. "I don't think this is the start of a
trend," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Bank in Germany.
"But assuming it is, [it clearly means bad news for the rest of the
eurozone]{.underline}." [Italy's continued confrontation with the
European Commission could have economic consequences for the eurozone if
not the entire world. The country is seen as a threat to financial
stability because of its enormous government debt, which equals more
than 130 percent of gross domestic product.]{.underline}

#### Germany's *[financial leadership]{.underline}* is key to preventing Eurozone collapse 

**Amadeo,** US Economy Expert for The Balance (Kimberly, Eurozone Debt
Crisis, Balance,
https://www.thebalance.com/eurozone-debt-crisis-causes-cures-and-consequences-3305524,
2-1-2019)//EF

[The eurozone debt crisis was the world\'s greatest threat in
2011.]{.underline} That\'s according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Things only got worse in 2012[. The crisis
started in 2009 when the world]{.underline} first [realized Greece could
default on its debt]{.underline}. [In three years, it escalated
into]{.underline} the [potential for sovereign debt defaults from
Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain.]{.underline} The European Union,
led by Germany and France, struggled to support these members[. They
initiated bailouts from the European Central Bank and the
I]{.underline}nternational [M]{.underline}onetary [F]{.underline}und.
These measures didn\'t keep many from questioning the viability of the
euro itself. **[A new crisis might be brewing.]{.underline}** On August
10, 2018, President [Trump announced he would double]{.underline} the
[tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Turkey.]{.underline} He was
trying to obtain the release of jailed American pastor Andrew Brunson.
Turkey claims he was involved in the 2016 coup to overthrow the
government. [The]{.underline} U.S. [move lowered the value of the
Turkish lira to a record low against the U.S. dollar. It renewed
fears]{.underline} that [the poor health of the Turkish economy could
trigger another crisis in the eurozone]{.underline}. Many European banks
own stakes in Turkish lenders or made loans to Turkish companies. As the
lira plummets, it becomes less likely these borrowers can afford to pay
back these loans. The defaults could severely impact the European
economy. **[As a result, Germany is considering lending Turkey enough to
prevent a crisis.]{.underline}** How the Eurozone Crisis Affected **[You
If those countries had defaulted, it would have been worse than the 2008
financial crisis.]{.underline}** Banks, the primary holders of sovereign
debt, would face huge losses. [Smaller banks would have collapsed. In a
panic, they\'d cut back on lending to each other. The Libor rate would
skyrocket like it did in 20]{.underline}08. The ECB held a lot of
sovereign debt. Default would have jeopardized its future. It threatened
the survival of the EU itself. **[Uncontrolled sovereign debt defaults
could create a recession or even a global depression.]{.underline}** It
could have been worse than the 1998 sovereign debt crisis. When Russia
defaulted, other emerging market countries did too. The IMF stepped in.
It was backed by the power of European countries and the United States.
This time, it\'s not the emerging markets but the developed markets that
are in danger of default. Germany, France, and the United States, the
major backers of the IMF, are themselves highly indebted. There would be
little political appetite to add to that debt to fund the massive
bailouts needed. [What Was the Solution?]{.underline} In May 2012,
[German Chancellor Angela Merkel developed a seven-point plan. It went
against newly-elected French President Francois Hollande\'s proposal to
create Eurobonds.]{.underline} He also wanted to cut back on austerity
measures and create more economic stimulus[. Merkel\'s plan would:
Launch quick-start programs]{.underline} to help business startups.
[Relax protections against wrongful dismissal]{.underline}. [Introduce
\"mini-jobs\" with lower taxes. Combine apprenticeships with vocational
education]{.underline} targeted toward youth unemployment. [Create
special funds and tax benefits to privatize state-owned businesses.
Establish special economic zones like those in China. Invest in
renewable energy.]{.underline} Merkel found this worked to integrate
East Germany. She saw how austerity measures could boost the
competitiveness of the entire eurozone. The seven-point plant followed
an intergovernmental treaty approved on December 8, 2011. [The EU
leaders agreed to create a fiscal unity parallel to the monetary union
that already exists.]{.underline} The treaty did three things. First, it
enforced the budget restrictions of the Maastricht Treaty. Second, it
reassured lenders that the EU would stand behind its members\' sovereign
debt. Third, it allowed the EU to act as a more integrated unit.
Specifically, the treaty would create five changes: Eurozone member
countries would legally give some budgetary power to centralized EU
control. Members that exceeded the 3 percent deficit-to-GDP ratio would
face financial sanctions. Any plans to issue sovereign debt must be
reported in advance. The European Financial Stability Facility was
replaced by a permanent bailout fund. The European Stability Mechanism
became effective in July 2012. The permanent fund assured lenders that
the EU would stand behind its members. That lowered the risk of default.
Voting rules in the ESM would allow emergency decisions to be passed
with an 85 percent qualified majority. This allows the EU to act more
quickly. Eurozone countries would lend another 200 billion euros to the
IMF from their central banks. This followed a bailout in May 2010. EU
leaders pledged 720 billion euros or \$928 billion to prevent the debt
crisis from triggering another Wall Street flash crash. The bailout
restored faith in the euro which slid to a 14-month low against the
dollar. The United States and China intervened after the ECB said it
would not rescue Greece. Libor rose as banks started to panic just like
in 2008. Only this time, banks were avoiding each other's toxic Greek
debt instead of mortgage-backed securities.

### 2AC -- German Leadership

#### Germany assuming *[reluctant leadership role]{.underline}* in NATO now -- the counterplan *[reverses]{.underline}* any progress -- Trump's leadership will just *[sideline]{.underline}* Germany's work

**World Politics Review 17** ("How Germany Is, Reluctantly, Assuming a
Leadership Role in NATO,"

WPR: What role does Germany play in the alliance, in terms of
participation in recent and ongoing missions and internal debates over
Russia and other potential threats? Bunde: [Germany has]{.underline}
clearly [increased its commitment to NATO in recent years.]{.underline}
Most importantly, [the government realized it needed to show more
solidarity with NATO's eastern flank]{.underline}. [Berlin played a key
role in setting]{.underline} [up the Very High Readiness Joint Task
Force (VJTF) and agreed to lead]{.underline} one of the [four
multinational battalions on NATO's eastern]{.underline}
[flank]{.underline}---the one based in Rukla, Lithuania. This was a
remarkable shift for Germany, where elites have traditionally argued
that Russia was a difficult partner, but a partner just the same.
Although Germany has long contributed to NATO's Baltic Air Policing
mission, deploying German soldiers as part of an effort at "tripwire"
deterrence sends an important signal to Germany's allies and to Russia.
This new deterrence posture is controversial, and few German politicians
actively defend the deployment, which is risky in the long run. Even
some politicians who are part of the coalition that took the decision,
including former Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Bavarian
Minister-President Horst Seehofer, have warned of the dangers of NATO
saber-rattling. As a result, shifts in Germany's stance have not always
been widely discussed. They are significant nevertheless, and they
extend beyond the eastern deployments. For example, [Germany has begun
to implement the so-called Framework Nations concept---a more
integrated, multilateral approach to shoring up NATO members' defense
capabilities---and has opened up some of its command structures to
partners.]{.underline} The Dutch army has two brigades under German
command. More recently, the Czech Republic and Romania have confirmed
their interest in developing similar ties to the German army.
**[According to some analysts, Germany's army is thus becoming Europe's
"anchor army," or the "backbone" of NATO's forces on the European
continent. There is clearly an emerging consensus within Germany's
strategic community that the country has to play a leadership
role---largely out of necessity because there is no one else to do
it.]{.underline}** But it is unclear whether the next German government
will be willing to spend the necessary resources to continue with this
approach. [Widespread reluctance]{.underline} among the broader
political elites and the population **[means Germany will remain a
rather reluctant military power.]{.underline}** WPR: What impact have
U.S. President Donald Trump's criticisms of the alliance had on domestic
debates and discussions over defense and security policy? Bunde: While
it is too soon to tell what the long-term consequences of Trump's
repeated criticism of European NATO members---and Germany in
particular---will be, [there already is a "Trump effect" in the German
debate on security policy. Some politicians]{.underline} and journalists
[have initiated]{.underline} a [discussion about a
potential]{.underline} European---or even [German---nuclear deterrent
that would be independent from the U.S]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
kind of [talk would have been]{.underline} considered completely
[outlandish a few years ago]{.underline}. And there is an intensifying
debate in Germany on defense spending. While most experts agree that
Germany has to spend more on defense---the current level is around 1.2
percent of GDP---[many point out that the actual output is more
important than reaching the 2 percent goalpost]{.underline}. Others also
contend that the burden-sharing debate should not be limited to defense
spending, and must also take into account expenditures for diplomacy,
conflict prevention and development cooperation. There is a possibility
that the "Trump effect" could actually end up hurting politicians who
support increased but smart spending on defense because it may look as
though they are merely responding to "The Donald" and not to the changes
in Germany's security environment. The issue will almost certainly
figure prominently in this year's election campaign, with many now
questioning the 2 percent goal. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has
already quipped that he would not know where to put all the aircraft
carriers Germany would need to buy to reach the target.

in Europe,"
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/02/13/a-conservative-case-for-german-leadership-in-europe/)//EF>

At heart, [what is a stake between the United States and
Germany]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [is]{.underline} not a dispute
about pipelines or negotiating tactics; it is [an argument over first
principles.]{.underline} [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[believes,]{.underline} to quote Mitchell, [that "the return of great
power competition is the defining geopolitical fact of our time," and
therefore the road to peace]{.underline} in Ukraine [leads through
crippling economic sanctions, arms sales, and]{.underline}, ultimately,
[regime change in Moscow]{.underline}. [The German view is much
different]{.underline}. [The alternative peace leads]{.underline}
through [negotiations to Kyiv, constitutional reform, and the
reconstruction of Eastern Ukraine.]{.underline} [In the German approach,
international peacekeepers are more useful than arms sales.]{.underline}
Protecting minority rights under the Helsinki Final Act is a more
reliable strategy than building up sovereignty by displacing language,
religion, and populations[. Dividing gas transit between Germany and
Ukraine might even be a better way of creating economic interdependence
than disrupting trade flows throughout the post-Soviet
world.]{.underline} The point here is not whether Berlin or Washington
have cracked the code to containing Russian aggression. Neither has
corralled Moscow. Neither has brought peace to Ukraine. The point is
that [these are very different worldviews. The State Department sees
Europe's eastern flank as a no-holds-barred great-power]{.underline}
[competition]{.underline}. And [Berlin sees Russian aggression and the
humanitarian tragedy in Ukraine through the lens of European history
since 1945.]{.underline} The difference of values implied by these
visions matters greatly. Finally, [there is a serious divergence between
the United States and Germany on the appropriate relationship between
the economy and the interests of the state]{.underline}. Angela
[Merkel,]{.underline} like most Germans, [has a largely benign view of
economic activity.]{.underline} Growth is good, diminishing inequality
within the population and integrating new members. Trade, particularly
exports, is wonderful in distributing comparative advantages around the
world. Prosperity is its own reward in modern Germany, and trade
relations are not intended to achieve the objectives of the German
state. One could imagine that, in the not too distant future, [Germany
might even return to the project of building vast, trans-oceanic free
trade zones around in the world.]{.underline} [Not so in Washington in
2019]{.underline}. There are walls to be built. Economic activity, to
again quote Mitchell, draws its "foundational importance from the
American nation state and national sovereignty as one of the key
sources, along with natural law, from which political legitimacy
ultimately derives." Setting aside for a moment the odd part about
natural law, this is a militant and fundamentally illiberal declaration
of mercantilist principles. As Mitchell confirms, "To a much greater
extent than in the recent past, the United States must treat the
promotion of U.S. business as inextricably linked to the future of our
nation's strength and influence abroad." There are two sides to the
dysfunctional Atlantic Alliance: Donald Trump's America, which has
selfishly substituted aggressive mercantilism and exploitative diplomacy
for international order; and a fretful Germany, which is oscillating
wildly between confusion and denial. It is the interaction between
America's abandonment of altruism in favor of crude economic bullying
and Germany's tendency to apologize and ingratiate that threatens
Euro-Atlantic order. If Europe wants to survive as a community, its
leaders must first realize that these are not trivial disagreements. If
Assistant Secretary Mitchell is to be believed, the United States will
try even harder to ensure that Europe does not succeed in taking its
destiny into its own hands. **[Unlike most EU member states, Germany has
rarely viewed its leadership positions in the European Commission as a
means for defending German interests.]{.underline}** To date, Germany
has done far more to realize the vision of Schumann and Monet than the
Brussels bureaucracy has done in practical terms for Germany. Without
effective coordination with the European Union, it is not surprising
that the level of German defense spending is set during American
Presidential campaigns. German exports of aluminum are regulated by the
U.S. Trade Representative, and exports to Iran are within the purview of
the Treasury Department. Tariffs on Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen are
subject to the whim of White House economic advisers. Germany's energy
policy is directed by threats from both the State Department and the
Secretary of Energy. The only major aspect of Germany economic
decision-making that is not a target of U.S. interference is climate
change policy. And this has been a moot point since 2017, when President
Trump withdrew the United States completely from the Paris climate
agreement. In this new world of mercantilism, protectionism, and
unilateral diktat, German industry is defenseless. From the heady days
of 2014-16, when the largest free trade deal in history between the
United States and Europe was within sight, to the trade wars and
coercive economic practices of the present, the descent has been
profound and more than a little frightening. Here again, Germany has not
reacted effectively to the changed circumstances and has thereby
hastened its own financial decline. As the largest economy in the
European Union, Germany should at a minimum take steps to secure the
position of Competition Commissioner and support the creation of a
European Commission willing to defend the integrity of European industry
and markets. Moreover, the U.S. Congress is now playing a significant
role in legitimizing mercantilist practices by passing legislation to
pressure EU members. For example, the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) explicitly threatens European companies
with criminal penalties. If one believes that there should be no
taxation, sanctions, or criminal penalties imposed on EU citizens
without representation, European political parties need to organize
defensive blocs in both the Bundestag and the European Parliament. The
purpose of these blocs should be to defend a balanced trading system
between the United States and European Union, to void extraterritorial
legislation damaging to the European economy, to prohibit coercive
practices, and, if appropriate, to retaliate against unfair trading
practices and meddling in EU internal affairs. As 2019 opened, both
political parties in the United States responded to Trump's reckless
decision to announce a withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan by adopting
Jim Mattis as a contrasting symbol of rectitude and honor. Such
theatrics are certainly easier to pull off than it is to explain to
voters that their President (and Congress) have treated their European
allies shabbily. Paeans to august personalities are no response to
Russian aggression in Europe's East, or to U.S. withdrawal from NATO's
out-of-area mission. Germany's silence has enabled the Washington's
compromised political elite to get away with run-of-the-mill jingoism, a
pointless Government shutdown, and the preposterous claim that
immigrants are a far greater threat to Western civilization than the
violent aggression of ISIS, the Taliban, and Iran. These falsehoods
should have been challenged more directly by German leaders. Certainly
isolationism and the duplicitous character of President Trump pose
serious threats to American democracy, but Germany's inability to
recognize and explain the greater threat that American conduct poses to
the political cohesion and defensive capability of NATO is far more
serious. Having solicited America's NATO allies to join multiple
Washington-led alliances of the willing in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the
Greater Middle East, the United States cannot now withdraw abruptly,
without warning or consultation. Words such as cowardice, betrayal, and
desertion exist to describe such conduct on the battlefield, but they
have not been heard clearly from anyone in Europe, particularly in
Germany. The conceptual problem here is that conservative German leaders
give the impression that ingratiation and flattery are the price to be
paid for keeping Donald Trump in a multilateral alliance. This is a very
bad idea. Military alliances, like good marriages, are maintained and
strengthened by a readiness to rebel at the first sign of the
undermining of the moral values that serve as the foundation for these
institutions. The absence of indignation in Berlin at the behavior of
President Trump is a sign that the process of national decathexis, (in
this context, the withdrawal of a political and emotional investment) is
well advanced in Germany. The fragmentation of NATO cannot be far
behind. An asymmetric relationship has developed between the State
Department and the German Foreign Ministry that bodes ill for sustaining
a friendship between equals. In Washington, German diplomats are overly
polite, often retiring, and usually ignored. In the classical tradition,
the German Embassy celebrates the political and cultural achievements of
Germany: brilliant automotive engineering, masterful football teams, the
architectural and social triumphs of German Reunification, and pilsner
beer. **[By contrast, American diplomats in Berlin are stunningly rude
and aggressively lobby against the business interests of their hosts,
against the government, and against the foreign policies of elected
German officials.]{.underline}** [The State Department is]{.underline}
in Berlin [to oppose, to disrupt, and often to undermine.]{.underline}
The U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell has sided with Kaczynski against
Germany, attacked German immigration policy, threatened German companies
with U.S. sanctions, and held himself out as a virtual proconsul for
U.S. extraterritorial overreach. It is hardly a secret that the European
Bureau of the State Department is no ally of Germany. There are two
discrete problems in the current Atlantic relationship. There is the
moral hazard of inequality in the application of treaties and the
economic danger in deteriorating trade relations between the United
States and European Union. In addition to the unethical connotations of
subordinate or second-class states, unequal relations are unstable and
pose a danger to an international system of order based on laws being
equally applied. No one benefits in a relationship where only one side
can do the shouting, the bullying, and the sanctioning. This same point
applies to diplomatic manners and protocol. [Unsurprisingly, Germany is
the country where Trump Administration officials have deliberately
behaved most poorly since 2016. Uniquely, Germany is the only
economically successful advanced democracy with little to say about its
reasons for being so, or where its destiny lies.]{.underline} In sharp
contrast to the interminable self-promotion and deceptions of Donald
Trump[, Germany is virtually mute in a world of constant
conversation.]{.underline} Whether this is due to the reserved
personality of Angela Merkel or a standoffish domestic political
temperament is irrelevant. Great nations at the beginning of the 21st
century shouldn't be ashamed to place the pursuit of their economic and
geopolitical interests within the frame of their larger humanitarian,
environmental, and political goals[. A well-developed explanation of
national purpose and shared political values is a necessity of
statecraft. Sadly, perhaps due to the hesitancy with which Germans are
conditioned to view modernity, the stories of German purpose and
leadership are missing.]{.underline} The above recommendations are
intended to suggest how German leadership might reverse the
deterioration of Western wealth and politics caused by the derangement
of America's moral compass and the deterioration of its capacity for
leadership. The basic premise is that [the adoption of more
disciplined]{.underline} and self-interested [policies on]{.underline}
the part of Chancellor Merkel's coalition government and its successor
[would]{.underline} serve to [rebalance the Euro-Atlantic alliance and
its system of trade.]{.underline} I've attempted here to draw on a
tradition of conservative sensibility common to Germany and America that
is liberal in its intentions if not in its theory. [A conservative
sensibility suggests that Germany could lead more effectively if it were
respected rather than merely liked, just as it would claim that the
United States could more easily recover its former status if it were
respected rather than disliked and feared.]{.underline} More to the
point, Germany's leaders should not accept unequal or one-sided
relationships as the norm in international politics. These relationships
are fundamentally destabilizing and undermine the principle of fairness
on which the NATO alliance and Euro-Atlantic system of free trade rely.
If in the past Europeans hated the command economies of the communist
world, today they should enthusiastically oppose the bullying economic
policies of the Trump Administration, which also distort economies,
coerce free enterprise, and seek unfair advantage in trade wars.
Finally, it is a fundamental principle of realism that geography,
history, and cultural proximity convey a seniority of interest to the
nation that lies closest to international disorder in terms of shared
values, common history, experience, and military and economic risks.
Therefore, it is absurd that relations with Russia, peace in Eastern
Ukraine, and the energy security of Europe are decided in distant
Washington and not by Berlin, Paris, and Brussels. **[It is a grave
mistake to think that Germany does not have a role in enforcing
appropriate behavior in diplomacy and ensuring that even Germany's
longtime allies do not overstep.]{.underline}**

### \--XT -- Germany DA 

#### Germany is a viable leader -- *[foreign policy experience]{.underline}*, *[economic planning]{.underline}*, and *[communication]{.underline}* all prove it'll *[do what's best for Europe]{.underline}*

[There are three reasons why Germany should be a major force in
consolidating and developing the EU]{.underline}. [First, it
has]{.underline} -- since its inception -- [made a foreign policy
leitmotif of promoting European integration over its own national
sovereignty]{.underline}. The German public widely believes Germany has
a foreign policy responsibility to advocate for the EU. [While Germany
also has its Euro-skeptic discourse]{.underline} -- as shown by the rise
of the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which
may well soon have a voice in Germany's parliament -- [an outright anti
EU attitude has yet to reach the political mainstream in Germany, unlike
in many other member states.]{.underline} [**This allows the German
government fairly broad scope to maneuver on matters of European
policy**. Second, the]{.underline} German [government has repeatedly
proven its leadership]{.underline} in recent years[, for example
engaging to resolve the economic crisis in the eurozone]{.underline}
[and working as part of the Normandy negotiating format]{.underline} (of
France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia) [to resolve]{.underline} the
[conflict with Russia over Ukraine]{.underline}. It can draw on its
experience as a compromise builder and help bring other parties on
board. [Third, Germany enjoys solid communication channels to all of its
EU partners]{.underline}. Despite criticism of its leadership position,
**[the German government has become an indispensable actor since the
outbreak of the financial crisis,]{.underline}** and it has
correspondingly solid networks at all levels of the decision-making
process.

#### Internal EU leadership is necessary to preserving a litany of issues -- the United States *[fails]{.underline}* 

**Kirch**, Research Associate at CISP, **17** (

The latest edition of ECFR's EU Coalition Explorer confirms that [most
EU member states retain]{.underline} their [high expectations of German
leadership in European Union.]{.underline} Indeed, **[Germany's
importance can be seen in the fact that it ranks higher than any other
country]{.underline}** across several categories the survey covers.
[Member states name Germany as their preferred partner in most EU policy
areas, including immigration and asylum, foreign and security, the
completion of the single market, and various aspects of economic and
eurozone governance]{.underline}. [As a result, Germany is also the
country member states contact most --]{.underline} and that is most
responsive to this outreach. So far, so good. **[In principle, the EU27
agree that EU cooperation -- be it intergovernmental or supranational,
flexible or unanimous -- requires decisive German commitment and
engagement]{.underline}**. **[A strong EU voice requires a strong German
voice.]{.underline}** However, domestic developments could prevent
Germany from fulfilling the role member states demand of it: that of a
predictable, forward-looking partner. In 2019, the coalition government
in Berlin has been characterized by a series of internal disagreements
on a range of issues. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) seemed to
have become more unified in the aftermath of a contest to replace
Chancellor Angela Merkel as its leader, and to have begun to work
through disputes with its sister party, the Christian Social Union
(CSU). Yet the rift between CDU/CSU and the Social Democrats now appears
to be widening -- on questions of not only the welfare state but also
security and defence policy. In a signal of Germany's willingness to
accommodate France, Merkel used her speech at the February 2019 Munich
Security Conference to stress that German compromise is important to
establishing a unified EU strategy on arms exports and defense sector
cooperation. This quickly prompted resistance from the Social Democrats.
The Aachen Treaty cannot hide the fact that Germany and France have
limited common ground on the future of the EU The Coalition Explorer
demonstrates the need for both a functioning Franco-German tandem and a
commitment to the strategic partnership among German policymakers. The
Aachen Treaty France and Germany signed last January appears to form
part of an attempt to revitalize their bilateral relationship at various
levels[. However, the agreement cannot hide the fact that the countries
have limited common ground on the future of the EU -- partly due to a
lack of a strong intra-German consensus on European policy and
structural reform]{.underline}. **[Meanwhile, a mixture of domestic
developments, external shocks, and challenges within the EU has
destabilized many EU coalitions]{.underline}**. Brexit has the potential
to make the EU more Franco-German or more French -- given that it has
been French President Emmanuel Macron rather than Merkel who has tried
to push the EU agenda forward (most recently by publishing a letter in
major newspapers in all 28 member states that calls for the revival of
the European project). The prospect of this shift has caused many of the
United Kingdom's traditional allies -- among them states outside the
eurozone, market liberalist powers, and countries skeptical of
strengthening the EU's social dimension -- to intensify their search for
new partners in Europe and beyond. At the same time, it has reminded
Berlin that traditional alliances cannot be taken for granted. Germany
has responded by attempting to diversify its bilateral relationships
within Europe, not least through the Federal Foreign Office's
"Like-Minded Initiative". This project identifies countries such as
Sweden, Finland, and Ireland as allies that might be willing to promote
joint European ideas. Germany has also taken an increasingly open-minded
approach towards sub-regional cooperation -- most visibly, with the
Visegrád group (comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and
Slovakia). Initially hesitant about the concept of minilateralism,
Berlin has now taken a more pragmatic stance. [In February, Merkel met
with the Visegrád heads of government to identify their shared
interests. As such, Germany has chosen to sit at the table rather than
to watch others talking from a distance. This has been especially true
when the United States and China have engaged with countries in central
or south-eastern Europe.]{.underline} For example, in September 2018,
Berlin opted to take part in the third summit of the Three Seas
Initiative as an observer, after US President Donald Trump joined the
format. Moreover, policymakers in Berlin have taken (justified)
accusations of double standards against them to heart. They have
realised that it is unsustainable for them to engage in Franco-German
consultations at all political levels while reproaching members of the
Visegrád group for exchanging views "behind closed doors". Since 2015,
European leaders have increasingly contested a narrative that re-emerges
in German policy discourse now and then: that German interests are
inseparable from European interests. For example, in a statement to mark
the beginning of his country's EU Council presidency in 2018, Austrian
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz explicitly criticised German policymakers for
often failing to make other EU member states feel that their views were
sufficiently valued. Meanwhile, some member states have heavily
criticised Germany for acting unilaterally and playing power games on
issues such as migration and the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline. Against
this background, Germany's manoeuvring within the EU very much reflects
the tension between the inclusive approach in its foreign policy DNA and
its attempts to pursue German interests at the EU level. Merkel and
various German ministers have repeatedly emphasised the need to bridge
EU divides and to reassure small and medium-sized countries that they
are not being pushed to the sidelines. This tension between national and
European is often difficult to address and, of course, not a purely
German phenomenon. [Yet, crucially, German policymakers have now begun a
discussion on the degree to which EU solutions require national
compromise]{.underline}. It remains to be seen whether German political
parties will use the European Parliament election campaign to
constructively engage with ideas and deals Germany can put forward to
make the EU more resilient and more capable of defending the interests
of EU citizens. Given the various internal and external challenges the
EU faces, it will not be enough for Germany to simply balance east and
west -- or north and south -- by increasing the number of bilateral and
minilateral meetings it holds. The hardest task for Berlin is to push
for credible compromises on long-term, strategically important policy
issues such as migration and asylum, energy and climate change, defence,
cohesion, and social security. [It is crucial that Germany uses its EU
Council presidency in 2020 to continue forging close ties with and
between its partners in the EU, while also putting forward solutions to
key policy challenges.]{.underline}

ambivalence towards it. Fewer than 50 percent of Americans responded
that they supported their country's membership in NATO]{.underline}, as
did fewer than 40 percent of French respondents. This ambivalence,
however, has not transformed into active opposition, and it is not known
whether this is simply part of a trend of growing popular mistrust of
public organizations, such as the government or the media. As NATO

#### Seen as an infringement on US *[sovereignty]{.underline}* -- highly unpopular

Sovereignty: NATO And The EU's Fatal Weakness,"
<https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/national-sovereignty-nato-and-the-eus-fatal-weakness/)//EF>

[Much and perhaps most of NATO and the EU's current travails can be
traced to the same basic flaw: national sovereignty.]{.underline} Both
organizations have elaborate consultative and rule-making structures.
NATO has a unified command structure. There is even a European
parliament. [Yet, the central fact that determines the way both
organizations function --- or in this case fail to do so]{.underline}
--- [is that their members retain their sovereign rights as independent
states.]{.underline} NATO without the United States spends nearly \$300
billion a year on defense and maintains some 1.6 million men under arms.
This should be enough to produce a military of enormous power. But such
is not the case. [As the conflict in Afghanistan and the air war over
Libya demonstrated, NATO has spent its money poorly, buying too much of
some capabilities and not enough of others. On occasion, as when it
decided to acquire]{.underline} and operate [a fleet of AWACS
aircraft]{.underline} or, quite recently, five Global Hawk Block 40s,
[NATO can a make good collective investment decision.]{.underline} The
same can be said of the international consortium to acquire the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter which includes a number of NATO members[. But most
of the military forces the Alliance has are the result of decisions by
individual countries]{.underline}. Rather than this being seen as a
serious problem for the Alliance, [its members view the exercise of
national sovereignty in ways that do damage to the collective security
of all members as something in which to take pride]{.underline}. The
EU's current problems are a consequence of protecting its members'
individual rights, particularly the right to cheap money and to
mishandle their national budgets, and not mandating individual
responsibility. Faced with the possible collapse of the single currency,
the Union's members cling ever tighter to their sovereignty. High debt
countries have moderated their fiscal and budgetary profligacy only
reluctantly and under the threat of even more dire consequences if they
did not. Those countries that have managed their economies well are
increasingly wondering if they should exercise their sovereign right to
bail on the whole enterprise. Supporters of both institutions will no
doubt respond that if national sovereignty had not been protected there
never would have been a NATO or an EU. Fair enough. **[However, if
national sovereignty is also a fatal weakness in both, then we are all
kidding ourselves about their future prospects.]{.underline}**

The objects of Thiessen's scorn are "globalists" like French President
Emmanuel Macron and his "liberal" fellow travelers in the United States.
He castigates progressive Americans, whom he says are all too willing to
subordinate popular democracy to the whims of "unelected bureaucrats
presiding over unaccountable institutions." By contrast, [Thiessen lauds
conservative nationalists, "who refuse to cede American sovereignty to
supranational institutions." The implication is clear: Without
conservatives manning the parapet, liberals would be tearing down the
walls of U.S. national sovereignty.]{.underline} Thiessen's argument
rests on a straw man. In reality, there is no global march toward
supranationalism, and little appetite for it among American
progressives. [To be sure, the world is becoming more institutionalized.
New multilateral frameworks of cooperation are being created to help
manage global problems from financial instability to nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. [But the]{.underline} vast [majority of
these]{.underline} cooperative [arrangements are inter-governmental
initiatives among fully sovereign states that have chosen to enter
multilateral organizations]{.underline}, ratify international treaties,
or join informal coalitions to get a better handle on globalization.
Crucially, these are horizontal relationships among independent nations,
not hierarchical arrangements that subordinate national political
authorities to some global entity. It is true that European Union (EU)
member states have accepted some degree of supranationalism. But [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates remains a very different
animal. It [jealously guards it sovereign prerogatives, protecting its
Constitution as the repository of popular sovereignty and the supreme
source of political authority]{.underline}**.** And [when proposed
international bodies]{.underline} (like the International Criminal
Court) [promise to infringe on national sovereignty]{.underline}, [they
have elicited skepticism from Democrats as well as
Republicans]{.underline}. In sum, the idea that current trends in
multilateral cooperation threaten the American people's sovereignty is a
red herring. Nevertheless, [it remains a staple of conservative
rhetoric, a canard frequently invoked to frighten Americans into
believing that the United States is on the slippery slope to some global
version of the EU]{.underline}---and eventually a world state. And one
can see why. Implying that U.S. "sovereignty" is in jeopardy is a good
way to mobilize American populists against multilateral initiatives like
the United Nations and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is
akin to implying that motherhood and apple pie are under attack and is
an effective way to distract the public from a more sober assessment of
America's stakes in a predictable, rule-governed world---and of the
costs and benefits of particular institutions. No surprise, then, that
President [Trump trotted out this bogeyman in]{.underline} June
[2017,]{.underline} [when he denounced the Paris Climate
Agreement]{.underline}---based on independently determined national
contributions---[as an infringement on U.S. sovereignty.]{.underline}

The multilateral development system, led by the United States, has
guided development cooperation by Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) countries, evolving gradually through new
institutions and new norms since World War II. Organized by a small
group of like-minded countries, [multilateralism has been a way of
managing burden-sharing among donors and of delivering public goods.
These functions are now under stress.]{.underline} [According to a poll
conducted in December 2016]{.underline} by the Program for Public
Consultation at the University of Maryland, [most Americans (59.3
percent) support the statement that "when giving foreign aid, it is best
for the U.S. to participate in international efforts, such as through
the United Nations.]{.underline} This way it is more likely that other
countries will do their fair share and that these efforts will be better
coordinated." [However, a majority of Republican voters disagree,
believing that it is better for the U.S. to provide aid on its own, to
ensure control over how money is spent and to gain recognition for its
generosity. This America First sentiment is most concerning because
multilateral institutions are uniquely equipped to respond to today's
development challenges.]{.underline} They can coordinate among multiple
development actors; conduct a coherent policy dialogue with government;
build partnerships with non-state actors; blend aid and loans with
private capital; play an honest broker role, especially in
government-business dealings; ensure transparency, consultation, and the
application of bestpractice safeguards in projects; and provide
accountable administrative structures on finance, data, and
results-evaluation.

## \--Perm Lie

### 2AC -- Lie Perm 

#### (\_\_\_) Perm: do the plan and consult Japan

#### A. the CP has 2 logical parts- it consults, and it fiats the outcome of consultation- this doesn't compete *logically:* it relies on artificially severing certainty.

#### B. Counterplans should be textually and functionally competitive- especially for *hyper generics* holding a high bar on competition is key to encouraging topic education

### 1AR Plan + Consult 

#### The CP has 2 logical parts- we permute the part that does consult, this forces the neg to read a topic link- consult over arms sales key -- rather than an artificial net benefit- just consult solves alliance 

#### Hold the neg to a high bar on competition for entirely plan inclusive counterplans- key to discourage race to the bottom/topic crowd out 

### AT: Severs 

#### -Misunderstands fiat- this argument assumes the plan WOULD be done, not SHOULD- consultative process is instant due to fiat, the plan is still immediate

the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.

(Eric and Ben, "Charging Assange reflects dramatic shift in US approach"
<https://www.apnews.com/3d9c190f66cc4e5b8669bcc0b6c1eff9>, LASA-IZP)

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [The decision to seek the extradition of Julian
Assange marked a dramatic new approach to the founder of WikiLeaks by
the U.S. government]{.underline}, a shift that was [signaled in the
early days of the Trump administration.]{.underline} President Barack
Obama's Justice Department had extensive internal debates about whether
to charge Assange amid concerns the case might not hold up in court and
would be viewed as an attack on journalism by an administration already
taking heat for leak prosecutions. But [senior Trump administration
officials seemed to make clear early on that they held a different view,
dialing up the rhetoric on the anti-secrecy organization shortly after
it made damaging disclosures about the CIA's cyberespionage tools.
"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a
hostile intelligence service," former CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in
April 2017]{.underline} in his first public speech as head of the
agency. ["Assange and his ilk," Pompeo said, seek "personal
self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western
values."]{.underline} A week after the CIA director's speech,
[then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the arrest of Assange was a
priority, part of a broader Justice Department crackdown on
leakers.]{.underline} ["We've already begun to step up our efforts, and
whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,"
he said.]{.underline} AP reporter Eric Tucker explains the indictment by
the U.S. Department of Justice against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange,
who was pulled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London and hauled into
court Thursday. (April 11) Pompeo, now secretary of state, declined
Friday to discuss the issue, citing the now-active legal pursuit of
Assange following his removal a day earlier by British authorities from
the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The administration won't say why they
decided now to charge Assange with a single count of computer intrusion
conspiracy that dates to 2010. Back then, WikiLeaks is alleged to have
helped Chelsea Manning, then a U.S. Army intelligence analyst, crack a
password that gave her higher-level access to classified computer
networks. Nor will they say whether the Obama administration had the
same evidence that forms the basis of the indictment, or whether Assange
will face additional counts if he is extradited to the United States.
But [a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss
internal and legal matters, traced the genesis of the indictment to
what's known as the "Vault 7 leak" in 2017, when WikiLeaks released
thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA tools for
breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and consumer electronics. A
former CIA software engineer was charged with violating the Espionage
Act by providing the information to WikiLeaks and is to go on trial
later this year in New York. And the leak was a tipping point in
deciding to pursue Assange, the official said.]{.underline} "Vault 7 was
the nail in the coffin, so to speak," the official said. [It ended years
of ambivalence about what to do about Assange, who was hailed by many
when WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of State Department
cables and U.S. military documents,]{.underline} including many that
revealed previously unknown facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Even
today, Assange and WikiLeaks have supporters around the world, amid a
debate over whether the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and
data counts as journalism. [Daniel Ellsberg, the former military analyst
behind the famed leak of the secret history of the Vietnam War known as
the Pentagon Papers, called the charging of Assange an "ominous" effort
to criminalize a necessary component of journalism.]{.underline} "The
charges are based on facts that were known throughout the Obama
administration, which chose not to indict because of the obvious
challenge to the First Amendment that would involve," Ellsberg said in
an Associated Press interview. A former Justice Department official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said
there was an extensive debate within the government over the feasibility
of charging Assange with the publication of stolen, classified
materials. But prosecutors grew concerned that such a case would not
hold up in court. Even though officials did not agree with Assange's
self-characterization as a journalist, the former official said, there
was concern that it would be hard to justify charging him with actions
that more conventional journalists take. The former official said the
department at the time was more amenable to bringing a case like the one
ultimately brought --- a narrower prosecution centered on a hacking
conspiracy. It focuses on an entirely different violation that may
obviate any First Amendment or press freedom concern. "This is just
charging a journalist with conspiracy to hack into computer systems,
which is no different than breaking into a building or breaking into a
classified safe," said Mary McCord, a senior Justice Department national
security official in the Obama administration. "And that's not First
Amendment protected activity." That is a widely held view in government,
even among people generally sympathetic to the mission of the media.
["This was deliberate and malicious effort to cause harm to us, to U.S.
national security interests, and I think it would be good if there is
some accountability at last," said David Pearc]{.underline}e, [who was
U.S. ambassador to Algeria in 2010]{.underline} when WikiLeaks released
hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables. "So far there hasn't
been any accountability for Mr. Assange."

#### Trump's lies don't matter-all anyone cares about is the story he tells

**Grossman, Chicago Tribune, 6-22-2018**

(Ron, "Why are Trump's lies not ruinous to him? Because truth can be in
the eye of the beholder"
<https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-met-grossman-trump-lies-supporters-20180621-story.html>,
LASA-IZP)

I would like to think that Donald Trump has finally told one lie too
many. He searched high and wide for someone to blame when his policy of
taking children away from parents caught surreptitiously crossing the
border backfired, big time. Before throwing in the towel and ending the
practice with a scratch of his pen, Trump said Democrats had to clean up
the mess. Their legislation created it, he claimed. That was a double
whopper. Since there is no such legislation, it couldn't be the
Democrats' fault. Then he claimed that dangerous criminals are posing as
loving parents in order to sneak into our country. That was a riff on
the Greek legend of the Trojan horse, and as Trump didn't offer a
scintilla of evidence, it also belongs on a library shelf labeled
"fiction." The fact is that [Trump feels no need to prove even his
wiggiest claims]{.underline}. Still, I've gone on doggedly hoping that
the sheer magnitude of his lies would eventually give his supporters
second thoughts. [The number of Trump's false or misleading claims
reached 3,251 by May 31, according to The Washington Post's fact-checker
database. Shortly thereafter, the Gallup Poll found that 87 percent of
Republicans gave him a favorable rating. To me, that means the time has
come to look the data square in the eye. It accords with what history
teaches: What one person sees as an obvious lie appears to another as an
undeniable truth.]{.underline} How do I know? The Bible tells me so.
Christians read the New Testament account of Jesus being born of a
virgin as literally true. Jews, whose ancestors produced the Old
Testament, find the idea incredible, and Muslims deny Jesus'
crucifixion. That suggests a general rule: [When hearing about a subject
to which we are emotionally committed, we often don't judge it against
the standard of objective truth. We accept it if it's compatible with
ideas we hold sacred, and reject it if it isn't.]{.underline} Nazi
Germany offers a case in point. Hitler came to power by preaching that
Germans were the "master race." That entitled them to seize control of
nations inhabited by the inferior beings. Yet the Fuhrer and his buddies
didn't look like super men. Hitler had a funny little mustache that gave
him the appearance of a clown. Charlie Chaplin so satirized him in "The
Great Dictator," giving movie audiences giggling fits. But Germans
didn't see the reality of Hitler's gang. Mesmerized by the pack of lies
he was feeding them, they marched into Russia. There millions perished,
many wearing summer uniforms in a bitter-cold winter. Hitler said they'd
be home before the snow fell. [To grasp Trump's hold over his followers
requires focusing less on his lies themselves than the story into which
he has woven them. By that worldview, ordinary Americans have been
hoodwinked by a snobbish elite that has profited at the expense of
workaday folks. He's their champion.]{.underline} A handful of
supporting examples to lend just enough credence to his worldview. For
example, pundits have decried Trump's broadsides against NAFTA. The last
three letters of the acronym stand for "free trade agreement." Yet
Canada imposes astronomical tariffs on milk imports. Why shouldn't an
American dairy farmer cry, "Liar, liar pants on fire!" when hearing the
word NAFTA? The lie ringing in the ears of his supporters is that free
trade is a fair fight. You're not likely to win that person over no
matter how many holes can be knocked into the rest of Trump's story by
wielding an ax of truth. [Yes, Trump lies with remarkable ease and
predictable regularity. He said he didn't know anything about hush money
paid to Stormy Daniels. Then said he did know --- without prefacing his
revised account with "I seem to have misspoken myself."]{.underline} Be
that as it may, [just throwing that up against Trump isn't likely to win
an election. People need something to believe in when they step into a
voting booth. They want to hear a compelling story.]{.underline}
Something like: "Once upon a time, Democrats saw that people were
hurting, so they created Social Security. Later, they saw that old
people couldn't afford a doctor, so they created Medicare. Sure, they've
dropped the ball, sometimes. But they own up to that. So how about I
tell you what other nitty-gritty human problems they'd like to tackle.
Here's one ..."

### AT: Lying Immoral 

#### -The government isn't a single "agent"- it can't have Kantian intent, so it can't *intend* to deceive 

#### It is important for politicians to hide the truth for their countries best interest

**Jay**, history professor at the University of California-Berkeley,
5/6/**10**

https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/05/06/why-politicians-should-lie

POLITICIANS GET A BAD rap for their sometimes elusive relationship with
the truth. Yet Martin Jay, author of The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying
in Politics, says there are times when lying may be the right thing to
do. After compiling the arguments of political philosophers through the
ages, Jay, a history professor at the University of California-Berkeley,
concludes that the American public should focus less on whether
politicians are being truthful and more on the outcomes of their
policies. He recently talked with U.S. News about why Americans should
not always expect to get the truth from political leaders. Excerpts:
When is lying acceptable? Well, I don\'t think there\'s any single rule.
There are, perhaps, more moments when lying is functional rather than
dysfunctional. For example, in the movie Inglourious Basterds, a peasant
is asked whether or not there are Jews hiding underneath his
floorboards. He ultimately tells the truth, and the SS man immediately
comes and shoots them. It would have been, on some level, maybe more
dangerous, maybe more courageous, but nonetheless, morally justified to
lie. [There are other instances when it\'s clear that to create
coalitions among partners who don\'t quite share all the same interests
and values, **it\'s necessary to pretend that there is the commonality
of those values and interests**. We see this even with primary
campaigns: candidates who have been calling each other names and
decrying the possibility of supporting their opponents then, after one
is selected, all rallying around that candidate. Either they were lying
before or after, but it\'s clear that there is some tacit obstruction of
truths to create a kind of coalition.]{.underline} How does America
compare to other nations in its virtues of truth-telling? Certainly in
the last decade or so, we\'ve become increasingly obsessed by it as an
issue. America began with the hope that it would be more transparent,
that accountability would be more explicit, that in a democracy people
were more prone to be truth-tellers than they were in an aristocratic,
or oligarchic, or monarchical system of government. There\'s a premium
being placed on plain talking, on being honest; you think of Honest Abe,
or George Washington, and that famous myth about felling the cherry
tree. Is lying more or less acceptable in a democracy than in a
totalitarian government? There\'s a so-called big lie that we associate
with totalitarianism. In perhaps the worst days of the Soviet Union or
Nazi Germany, a good part of the citizenry was fooled by government
propaganda into believing they were living in prosperous, and in some
ways justifiable, societies. So those are countries in which the big lie
worked, for a while at least. In the United States, luckily, we don\'t
have the capacity for that due to a relatively free press and a
pluralist political system. What [we have instead are many different
competing half-lies, spins, rhetoric, or positions that hide the truth.
In a way, it\'s healthy to have this very mixed combination of truths,
half-truths, and the occasional outright lies, rather than to have a big
lie or a single truth in which one party claims, or one person claims,
to have a monopoly on the truth. I\'m always very nervous when a
politician claims that he or she alone has personal integrity,
authenticity, and is a truth teller, and all opponents are scoundrels
and liars.]{.underline} So, absolute truth doesn\'t exist in politics?
Absolute truth is very hard in any context, really. Politics is not an
arena in which absolute truth is the goal. Politics is made up of
promises about the future, and we don\'t know what the truth of the
future is going to be. It\'s also made up of narratives. Narratives, by
definition, are always, in a way, semi-representative of what is the
case. Also, in politics, we don\'t do what we do in a court of law. We
don\'t swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth. There are lots of things about politics that allow us to
appreciate aesthetic and rhetorical qualities that are very different
from seeking the truth in a courtroom, or a scientific experiment, or a
scholarly debate. Are politicians\' lies ever more justified than those
of the everyday citizen? [**Politicians** often **have
responsibilities**, which allow them, at times, **to delay the
truth**.]{.underline} Or, especially when they\'re representing us in an
adversarial relationship with another country, [they may be very sparing
with the truth. Certainly in diplomatic circumstances]{.underline}, [and
obviously in wartime, politicians who are responsible for protecting us
can withhold the truth]{.underline}. We had no obligation to tell the
Nazis where we were going to land on D-Day. Having said that, there are
many examples of politicians who hide behind those justifications as an
excuse not to tell us truths that we are indeed owed, and those
politicians often do pay a price. My argument certainly is not a defense
of politics as inherently hypocritical. I think the default position of
politics, as in life, has to be telling the truth, simply because lies
don\'t work unless they\'re told against the backdrop of the assumption
that people are, in fact, telling truths. Do you look at the government
differently after writing this book? There\'s no policy implication that
comes out of this. I\'m not urging governments to lie, and I\'m not
urging the citizenry to be complacent about mendacity. But what I\'m
trying to say is that it\'s more important to focus on the issues, on
the policies, and on the effects these have on people\'s lives, than to
constantly look for discrepancies in promises and performance, or to
look for inconsistencies in a person\'s career. We need to see how
citizens are affected by the policies that our politicians pursue.
That\'s far more important than looking for a perfect politician. You
can have an absolutely incorruptible figure who is a fool. And you can
have somebody who is morally complex, and yet his policies help people
more. Why should America\'s leaders read your book? It does give them at
least some understanding of the complexities, and it may help them back
away from simplistic accusations. Another thing about lying in politics
is the inevitability of people accusing their opponents of lying. It\'s
just one thing that politicians have to understand is part of the game
or the life in the world they inhabit. We need to focus more on policies
and their outcomes than on this kind of accusation of mendacity, which
gets us nowhere

**Lying in cases of public policymaking are moral**

and the President of the Association of American Colleges and
Universities, Professor of political science at the University of Rhode
Island, Public Integrity, ISSN: 1099-9922 (Print) 1558-0989, "The Ethics
of Lying in the Public Interest: Reflections on the \"Just Lie"")//EF

Almost all commentators on official lying trace the roots of this
practice to Machiavelli. Plato is spared paternity of the great lie
presumably because he thought the myths told by his Philosopher King
were not really deceptions but stories that portrayed truths that simple
minds could grasp only through fictitious facts. Machiavelli
countenanced more outright deception. He was not a skeptic about whether
humans can know the truth, but he was a profound skeptic about whether
humans in power can say the truth. [Machiavelli did not advise deception
for reasons of mere expediency but for reasons of necessity: a prudent
ruler cannot, and must not, honor his word when it places him at a
disadvantage and when the reasons for which he made his promise no
longer exist. If all men were good, this precept would not be good; but
because men are wretched creatures who would not keep their word to you,
you need not keep your word to them]{.underline}. (1981, pp. 99--100)
Machiavelli saw politics as a deadly serious pursuit. The prince who
wants to achieve something, even (indeed especially) if it is in the
interest of the people, has so many forces aligned against any change
that he cannot afford to abide by the rules of ethics that apply in
private life. [When a person of power tries to change the status
quo]{.underline}, Machiavelli warned, [the people who will be harmed,
even if they are a small minority, can usually stave off the change
because they are more organized]{.underline}, more motivated, more aware
of the advantage they will be losing. [Those who will gain,]{.underline}
especially if they are poor and downtrodden, [will support the change
only halfheartedly, for they have not experienced the fruits of the
change]{.underline} and are dubious that there will be any real
difference. [Anyone who doubts the currency of this]{.underline}
500-yearold [argument need only]{.underline} [consider the campaigns of
the National Rifle Association against gun control and]{.underline} the
[insurance industry against universal health care]{.underline}.
Machiavelli has shocked moralists over the centuries by how candidly and
casually he reaches dark conclusions: "But one must know how to colour
one's actions and to be a great liar and deceiver" (1981, 100). However,
Machiavelli does not see the political leader who lies as a monster or
as necessarily at odds with the interests of the people. He follows the
sentence just quoted with what he considered a reassuring observation:
"Men are so simple, and so much creatures of circumstance, that the
deceiver will always find someone ready to be deceived." Machiavelli
seems to think that the outrage of political leaders lying to their
citizens is greatly diminished by one overriding reality---[most
citizens do not want to know the truth. We would like to think that
Machiavelli is simply self-serving]{.underline} in this discouraging
conclusion [or at the least that it applied only in]{.underline} [his
time of]{.underline} greater illiteracy and [lack of experience with
democracy]{.underline}. [But political experience]{.underline} again
gives at least partial [validation to Machiavelli's undemocratic
observations]{.underline}. [The electorate makes contradictory
demands]{.underline} on candidates [to the extent that]{.underline}
[most are compelled]{.underline} at least [to stretch the truth in
promising more services and no new taxes]{.underline}. Plain-speaking
truth-tellers very seldom go far in a democracy. People rant about
Congress as an institution and rank the veracity of politicians below
that of used-car salespersons, but every two years we return more than
90 percent of the incumbents to Congress. The shock expressed about the
expletives and racial slurs heard on the Nixon White House tapes seems
to confirm Machiavelli's point that [citizens in general want to believe
the best about their rulers and do not make it difficult]{.underline}
for rulers [to create appearances or outright deceptions.]{.underline}
Machiavelli would find it odd that people are shocked by his defending
the telling of lies by those in power. To push the case even further,
Machiavelli might argue that [because leaders are
responsible]{.underline} [not only for their own well-being but also
that of their citizens,]{.underline} [they have]{.underline} not only
the opportunity and right but also [an obligation to become convincing
liars.]{.underline}

## \--Perm Do the Plan, Rollback If They Say No 

### Notes 

- Read this perm if they make circumvention args in the 1NC --- they are
  gonna be like the durable fiat is not an answer --- the plan can get
  rolled back

- Don't explain the perm in the 2ac

- Block is gonna be like you have to defend the 1certainty of the plan

- 1ar is like they contradicted themselves --- we'll concede that the
  plan can get rolled back which means the perm is legitimate and the CP
  is not competitive

### 2AC -- Do the Plan then -- Rollback If They Say No

#### Perm do the plan and then consult, rollback the plan if they say no 

#### It solves --- any say yes cards in the 1NC just means that they won't roll it back 

#### It's legit --- permutation includes all of the aff and rollback is functionally the same as abiding by the outcome

### 1AR -- Do the Plan then -- Rollback If They Say No

#### Extend the perm do the plan and then consult, rollback the plan if they say no --- it solves, all the say yes cards prove that they'll say yes and won't know that the consultation wasn't prior.

### AT: Rollback Is Intrinsic

#### The perm isn't intrinsic --- functionally operates the same as the CP since a 'say no' means the plan goes away.

#### the perm includes that

#### If it is --- Intrinsic Perms Good --

#### It's key to test the germaneness of the link --- if they win the link they beat the perm

#### Key to aff ground --- it's a functional limit on cheaty CP's like this that are built on artificial competition

#### Reject the arg not the team.

### AT: Timeframe

#### The perm isn't a timeframe perm --- it does both immediately but since the outcome of consultation doesn't come immediately, then rolling back would happen after implementation of the plan 

### AT: Severs Certainty

#### It doesn't sever --- the CP competes off implied certainty --- the aff doesn't have to win that the plan will happen but that it should happen ---

#### "Should" means desirable \-\-- this does not have to be a mandate

**AC 99** (Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html)

shall

**[[\'shall\' describes something]{.mark} that is
[mandatory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If a requirement uses \'shall\', then
that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied without fail. Noncompliance is
not allowed. Failure to comply with one single \'shall\' is sufficient
reason to reject the entire product. Indeed, it must be rejected under
these circumstances. Examples: \# \"Requirements shall make use of the
word \'shall\' only where compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good
example. \# \"C++ code shall have comments every 5th line.\" This is a
bad example. Using \'shall\' here is too strong.

should

**[[\'should\']{.mark} is weaker. It [describes something that might not
be satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable]{.mark}
enough]{.underline}** that any noncompliance shall be explicitly
justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined carefully, as it
probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a
\'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be discarded entirely,
so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should be ANSI compliant.\"
A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all
platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be tested thoroughly.\"
Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with \'shall\' if this
requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what
\'thoroughly\' means).

### **[AT: Saying No Is A Solvency Deficit]{.underline}**

#### The perm is just a test of competition, it's not an advocacy --- "say no" is an answer to the substance of the CP, not its theoretical legitimacy --- no cross applications

## \--Perm Do the Plan and Consult On Another Issue

### 2AC -- Do the Plan and Consult On Another Issue

#### Perm do the plan and consult on another issue --- 

#### It solves --- their solvency advocates don't specify the plan as the key issue --- only consulting in general is key 

#### It's legitimate --- it includes the entirety of the aff and it consults 

### 1AR -- Do the Plan and Consult On Another Issue 

#### Extend Perm do the plan and consult on another issue --- it solves --- their 1NC cards don't specify what the US has to consult over to maintain alliance --- no reason why consulting over the plan is key 

### AT: Intrinsic

#### It's not intrinsic --- "on another issue" isn't part of the perm text --- it just clarifies that the indirect object of the verb consult is unknown --- 

#### If it is intrinsic --- that's good --

#### It's key to test the germaneness of the link --- if they win the link they beat the perm

#### Key to aff ground --- it's a functional limit on cheaty CP's that are built off artificial competition

#### If we win artificial competition is bad, then the perm is justified 

#### Reject the argument, not the team.

### AT: Links To the Net Benefit

#### It doesn't link --- no reason why consulting specifically over the aff is key to solving --- whether the aff or another issue will be a bigger issue is completely arbitrary 

### AT: Vagueness 

#### It's not vague 

#### *[Infinitely regressive]{.underline}* --- no brightline for how much we should spec about the issue 

#### It's not about the issue, it's about the consultation --- none of their ev says the plan is key, only says that we should consult

## \--Perm Do the CP

### 2AC -- Do the CP

#### Should means conditional---it's not certain

SHALL

When used as an auxiliary verb, [shall]{.underline}, according to
Webster\'s Online Dictionary, "[denotes a requirement that is
mandatory]{.underline} whenever the criterion for conformance with the
specification requires that there be no deviation" (2). [This word
implies obligation and is traditionally used by laws and
regulations]{.underline}. For example, Chapter V of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), "Drugs and Devices," begins with the
following:

"A drug or device shall be deemed to be adulterated --" (3).

Similarly, [the FDA's regulations]{.underline} frequently [use shall to
indicate mandatory requirements]{.underline}. In CFR - Code of Federal
Regulations Title 21, Part 803, the regulation for medical device
reporting, the English reporting requirement states:

"All reports required in this part which are submitted in writing or
electronic equivalent shall be submitted to FDA in English" (4).

SHOULD

[On the other hand, [should "denotes a guideline or **recommendation**
whenever noncompliance]{.mark}]{.underline} with the specification [[is
permissible]{.underline}]{.mark}." When used as an auxiliary verb, [[it
expresses "a **conditional** or contingent act or
state]{.mark}]{.underline} ... or moral obligation" (5).

The statement "Incoming materials shall be inspected before they are
accepted in warehouse" is mandatory. All incoming materials must be
inspected before they are accepted in warehouse. A deviation causes a
noncompliance with the document.

In contrast, "Incoming materials [should]{.underline} be inspected
before they are accepted in warehouse" [is a recommendation by the
document writer. It allows the document users to make their own judgment
calls.]{.underline}

In reality, the incoming materials will most likely be inspected before
they are accepted. However, the document users at any time can make a
deviation based on the specific situation, as long as the decision
making is reasonable and logical. (Recall also that the word should does
imply moral obligation.) Such deviation does not violate the document's
requirement.

[Because of the built-in flexibility]{.underline} of the word, [if the
document writer intends to **mandate** a requirement, **should is not an
appropriate choice**]{.underline}.

#### Should is distinct from will which necessitates certainty 

#### They justify perm do the counterplan by being plan plus

#### No time abuse, disads based of time are not intrinsic to the topic i.e. politics

### 1AR -- Do the CP

#### Perm do the counterplan is not severance from the plan rather the counterplans binding stuff which we can do 

#### Should does not mean certain means we don't sever from certainty their definitions are about specific court cases at the district level not a generic definition that is accessible 

#### We don't kill agenda politics they still get the USMCA because we still defend the process of the plan just not necessarily their interpretation justifies fiat instantaneous arguments which are net worse for politics debates and either way politics debates are bad because they kill 

## \*\*\*THEORY\*\*\*

## \--Consult CPs Bad

### 2AC -- Consultation CPs Bad

#### Consult CPs are bad --

#### Moots the 1AC -- that's bad for:

#### *[Fairness]{.underline}* -- steals the entirety of the aff and shifts it to negative offense with net benefits as advantages

#### *[Education]{.underline}* -- it turns into debating yourself and they get no unique offense, it removes clash without authentic offcase competition, leads to less depth in debates

#### *[Unpredictability]{.underline}* -- there are a litany of actors that the neg can choose to consult -- it's impossible to prep for all the possible CPs and that's amplified by a limited specific literature base

#### *[Plan plus]{.underline}* -- consult CPs justify plan plus CPs if the actor is guaranteed to say yes

#### Reading the consult CP as a DA solves all their offense.

### 1AR -- Consultation CPs Bad -- Top

#### Stealing the entirety of the 1AC is a voting issue for:

#### *[Fairness and Education]{.underline}* -- it shifts all the aff's offense into the neg's and turns the net benefits into advantages, it leads to debating ourselves and it's impossible to generate authentic solvency deficits

#### The fact that the actor says yes proves that consultation isn't necessary, the CP is functionally plan plus.

### 1AR -- Consultation CPs Bad -- A2: Real World/Education

#### Fairness outweighs real world -- stealing the entirety of the aff should be the biggest voting issue in the round

#### Real world is a bad debate -- Trump isn't going to pass plans in any world, debates should be about how the world should function not how it does.

### 1AR -- Consultation CPs Bad -- A2: Forces 2AC Strategy

#### Predictability is good -- not being able to research in advance disincentivizes research skills, it's a bad model of debate

#### Predictable arguments allow for in-depth pre-round research that creates deeper dives into arguments within the round, which creates more education.

### 1AR -- Consultation CPs Bad -- A2: Neg Flex

#### No unique reason this CP is more of a key generic than things like the Russia fill-in DA or Conditions CPs

#### Our offense is a reason it shouldn't be a key generic on the topic.

### 1AR -- Consultation CPs Bad -- A2: Literature Demands

#### There isn't enough aff-specific literature about consultation -- still means the CP is unpredictable.

### 1AR -- Consultation CPs Bad -- A2: Uncertainty/Immediacy

#### \[Refer to uncertainty/immediacy blocks\]

## \--Aff Must Not Be Certain

### 2AC -- Aff Must Not Be Certain

#### Aff doesn't have to be certain --

#### Should isn't mandatory

Other legislated DA earmarks in the FY2005 appropriations bill are
smaller and more targeted: plant biotechnology research and development
(\$25 million), the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program (\$20
million), women's leadership capacity (\$15 million), the International
Fertilizer Development Center (\$2.3 million), and clean water treatment
(\$2 million). Interestingly, in the wording of the bill, Congress uses
the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.
[The **difference** between *shall* and *should* may have **legal
significance**---one is clearly **mandatory** while the other is a
**strong admonition**---but it makes little practical
difference]{.underline} in USAID's need to comply with the congressional
directive to the best of its ability.

#### "Resolved" doesn't require certainty

**Webster's 9** -- Merriam Webster 2009

(http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resolved)

\# Main Entry: 1re·solve \# Pronunciation: \\ri-ˈzälv, -ˈzȯlv also -ˈzäv

[re·solved]{.underline}; re·solv·ing 1 : to become separated into
component parts; also : to become reduced by dissolving or analysis 2 :
to form a resolution : determine 3 : [consult, deliberate]{.underline}

#### Prefer our definitions --

#### *[Topic education]{.underline}* -- generic counterplans that compete off certainty are not grounded in the resolution -- that kills in depth topic research and encourages a race to the bottom -- teams can read the same counterplan every year 

#### *[Aff ground]{.underline}* -- PICs that compete off the mandate of the plan, not assumed certainty, are legitimate -- the counterplan is not -- they moot the 1AC and provide no aff offense except for impact turning the net benefit

### 1AR -- Aff Must Not Be Certain

#### The aff doesn't have to be certain -- should isn't mandatory -- it implies a desire -- AND -- resolved means to deliberate -- its not a mandatory action -- that's Webster

#### Prefer it -- topic education -- they shift the focus from the topic to generic counterplans that can be run every year -- AND -- aff ground -- PICs that compete off certainty moot the 1AC and provide predictable aff offense -- 

### AT: Neg Ground

#### No neg ground loss -- they still get topic specific counterplans that don't compete based off certainty -- AND we'll defend the process of the plan so they get their DA links

### AT: Aff Ground

#### No aff ground loss -- questions of should means rollback doesn't matter -- we still defend the process of the plan

### AT: Neg Ground

#### No neg ground loss -- we defend the idea of the plan -- that still links to DAs

### AT: Aff Ground

#### No aff ground loss -- questions of should means rollback doesn't matter -- they misunderstand fiat

Because the main function of should in modern American English is to

can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I should get my flu shot if I
were you. Furthermore, should seems an affectation to many Americans
when used in certain constructions quite common in British English: Had
I been informed, I should (American would ) have called immediately. I
should (American would ) really prefer a different arrangement. As with
shall and will, most educated native speakers of American English do not
follow the textbook rule in making a choice between should and would.

[Resolve]{.underline}: "To form a purpose; to make a decision;
especially, [to determine after reflection]{.underline}; as, to resolve
on a better course of life."

#### Prefer our definitions -- 

#### *[Topic education]{.underline}* -- topic DAs are not time sensitive --they only lose politics -- that's bad either way because it shifts the focus and disincentives research on the topic

#### *[Limits]{.underline}* -- the aff can never prepare for any possible delay counterplan -- that moots the 1AC and forces the aff to impact turn the net benefit anytime 

### 1AR -- Aff Must Not Be Immediate 

#### The aff doesn't have to be immediate -- should means intend to and resolved means to determine -- thats Nieto and PTE -- 

#### Prefer it for topic education -- they still get topic DAs like fill in BUT lose generic DAs that shift the focus from the topic -- AND -- limits -- infinite forms of delay CPs means the aff can never win -- no advantage can answer all possible timeframes -- moots the 1AC and kills predictable aff offense

### AT: Neg Ground/Moving Target

#### No neg ground loss -- they still get topic generics -- only lose politics DAs but those are bad either way -- that's the OV

### AT: Limits 

#### No under limiting -- there's no reason timeframe arguments are key to neg research or strategy -- delay cps and poltics are bad either way -- that's the ov -- BUT 1AC CX checks any shifts

### AT: Neg Ground/Limits

#### No neg ground loss or limits -- we defend the idea of the plan -- that still links to DAs and is a predictable stasis

## \--Words Determine What The Plan Means

### 2AC -- Words Determine What The Plan Means

#### The aff should get to determine what the plan means-

#### *[Arbitrary and regressive]{.underline}* -- there are infinite ways to define every word in the plan and incentivizes a race to the bottom to find the most obscure definition possible to moot the plan 

#### *[Context matters]{.underline}* -- terms of art all used together in a plan text mean different things- it's the aff's right to determine word placement

#### *[Topic education]{.underline}* -- it's key to aff innovation within the literature which prevents stale debates and deepens overall clash 

#### *[Functional limits check]{.underline}* -- solvency advocates mean there's limits in the lit base for plan text meaning

#### *[CX checks]{.underline}* -- the neg can always clarify plan text meaning or what the aff defends

### 1AR -- Words Determine What The Plan Means 

#### The aff should get determine what the plan means- definitions of words are arbitrary and incentivize a race to the bottom that decks predictability- aff innovation and education outweighs because functional limits based in literature ensure a stable stasis point and cx checks any of their abuse claims.

### AT: Predictability

#### Cross apply the context argument here- literature and solvency advocate ensure the aff must stay true to their mechanism which disproves arbitrariness

### AT: Moving Target

#### CX checks all abuse because the aff has to explain how they defend the mechanisms of the aff and what it does- cross apply the predictability argument- it's not a moving target

### AT: Access Education Impacts

#### Allowing the aff to explain what the plan text means isn't mutually exclusive with legal precision- probably means that we actually access it better because the entirety of the aff is key to better contextualize the literature

### AT: Words and Grammar Matter

#### Hold the neg to the burden of proving that the way we've explained aff solvency mechanisms or the words in the plantext are incorrect before you grant them this argument otherwise, we access this just as well as the neg. 

## \--Delay Fiat Bad

### 2AC -- Delay Fiat Bad

#### Delay Fiat is Bad

#### *[Ground]{.underline}* -- they moot the aff and compete off of immediacy which is arbitrary and kills fairness 

#### *[Education]{.underline}* -- they do the whole aff but shift the debate to timeframe which avoids core topic controversies and education by focusing on bad politics DAs

#### *[Unpredictable]{.underline}* -- there's no literature base for delays which makes comparison against the aff impossible

#### *[Infinitely Regressive]{.underline}* -- there's infinite possible time delays which makes it impossible to be aff since there's no specific answers-that justifies perm do the CP 

#### *[Fairness]{.underline}* -- they make us tear apart our own aff to generate CP answers which they can cross-apply to the case for to win every debate

### 1AR -- Delay Fiat Bad

#### Reject the team for Delay Fiat-they steal the aff which forces us debate our own aff to generate solvency deficits against the CP-they can cross-apply those answer onto to the case flow to take out the aff which means they'll always outweigh on a DA or go for presumption which isn't educational and tips the scales in their favor-fairness should come first since it's the only impact the ballot can resolve because losing incentivizes them to not read this again

#### Delay fiat also kills education by making the debate about an arbitrary time delay which means we don't discuss the content of the aff or core controversies surrounding arms sales so we can't access topic education which is the only point of debating anyway

#### Delay fiat is infinitely regressive because they can fiat unlimited time delays which is unpredictable since it isn't defined in the literature base which is the stasis of the topic and it also makes it impossible to be aff since we need time-sensitive answers which are impossible to research-that justifies going for perm do the CP since there's no other answer

### AT: Real World

#### Not real world-policymakers don't decide on specific dates to delay policies until, they just go through a process of delaying them-fairness should come first since barely any debate actually become policymakers and an individual debate won't change our interactions with policy

### AT: Best Policy Option

#### Best policy option is arbitrary-the CP and the Plan do the same thing which means it's impossible to make a determination on which is best especially since they have no warrant for this argument

### AT: Education

#### They're net worse for education since they shift it onto timeframe instead of the topic which is unpredictable since the resolution is the only thing everyone has equal access to and the point of debate is learning about the topic

#### They can still access education about politics DAs without delay CPs-there's inevitably a link and they could just read an actor CP to avoid a link

### AT: Neg Flex

#### The neg gets 13 minutes of block time and we only have 5 minutes to answer it-that justifies going for theory since it's impossible to cover everything with substance

#### Infinite prep is a myth because of life and they can access it via generics, the first/last speech benefit is inconsequential, and the lit isn't aff-biased-proven by a deep base on heg and the econ surrounding arms sales

### AT: Not Arbitrary

#### Immediacy is a bad standard since it isn't specified in the plan, normal means goes through the legislative process which can never be immediate since things like votes take time and there's no brightline between that time delay and theirs, and there's literature in the context of should that doesn't imply immediacy-here's some evidence

#### Should doesn't mean immediate

Clyde\'s will provides, \"in the event any of my children should
predecease me leaving issue who survive me, then the share of such
predeceased child shall go in equal shares to his or her issue who
survive me, per stirpes.\" We find no error in the district court\'s
conclusion  \[\*6\] that an intent to avoid the application of the
antilapse statute is not \"clear and explicit\" from the terms of the
will. The will states \"in the event\" Clyde was predeceased by a child,
when in fact Clyde had been predeceased by two of his children at the
time the will was written. If the will was referring to the children who
had already predeceased Clyde, there would be no need to say \"in the
event.\" By stating \"in the event\" it is clear Clyde was looking ahead
to possible future events, when one of his children who were alive when
the will was written might predecease him.

## \--Entirely Plan Inclusive CPs Bad 

### 2AC -- Entirely Plan Inclusive CPs Bad

#### Counterplans that can result in the exact same action as the aff are illegitimate 

#### Decks aff ground -- moots the 1AC and kills any possible unique offense -- we can't leverage specific advantages or mechanisms because they compete off of implied certainty and immediacy 

#### Should is legally variable -- not a mandate

**Raggi, 3** -- US Circuit Judge (Rena, THOMAS DALLIO,
Petitioner-Appellant, \--v.\-- ELIOT L. SPITZER, New York State Attorney
General, MICHAEL MCGINNIS, Superintendent, Southport Correctional
Facility, Respondents-Appellees. Docket No. 01-2718 UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT, 9/9, lexis)

In any event, we note that Faretta\'s use of the word \"should\" in
identifying warnings relevant to waivers of counsel itself cautions
against interpreting the quoted language as clear establishment of a
legal mandate. [Although grammatically]{.mark} the word \"[should\"
is]{.mark} [simply]{.mark} the past tense of \"[shall,]{.mark}\" see
Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide, 931 (1999), [**in the
legal context**, the]{.mark} two [words]{.mark} often [convey quite
different meanings]{.mark}. ^HN9^\"[Shall\" is]{.mark} universally
[understood]{.mark} [to indicate an imperative or mandate]{.mark}, see
Black\'s Law Dictionary, 1375 (6th ed. 1990), whereas \"should,\" to the
extent it implies any duty or obligation, generally references one
originating in \"propriety or expediency,\" id. at 1379. Precisely
because the word \"should\" is legally variable, compare United States
v. Anderson, 798 F.2d 919, 924 (7th Cir. 1986) (\"the common
interpretation of the word \'should\' is \'shall\' and thus . . .
imposes a mandatory rule of conduct\") with Culbert v. Young, 834 F.2d
624, 628 (7th Cir. 1987 ) (\"the word \'should\' unlike the words
\'shall,\' \'will,\' or \'must,\' is permissive rather than mandatory\"
); and McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 758 F.2d
341, 347 (8th Cir. 1985) \[\*\*25\]  (holding that \"**[[should\" is a
preferential]{.mark} rather than mandatory word]{.underline}** and that
contract provision stating that parties \"should\" settle disputes in a
particular forum was not a mandatory selection clause),  \[\*563\]  we
cannot infer from its use in Faretta the Supreme Court\'s recognition of
a clearly established prerequisite for a waiver of counsel.

#### Destroys clash -- the only way to deploy offense is to debate yourself -- negs will inevitably cross apply onto other flows and/or go for presumption

#### Destroys topic education -- shifts debates away from affirmative controversies and onto contrived questions of implementation 

#### Justifies infinitely regressive counterplans that pinpoint non-aff specific problems -- i.e. CP do the aff if racism stops 

#### Err aff on theory -- negs get a 13-minute block, and we've already lost our 1AC 

**Reject the team -- the damage has already been done.**

### 1AR -- Entirely Plan Inclusive CPs Bad

#### Hold the neg to a high bar on competition for entirely plan inclusive counterplans- key to discourage race to the bottom/topic crowd out -- especially when they have already mooted 8 minutes of 1AC offense 

### AT: Best Policy Option 

#### This isn't an argument -- this defends the neg reading CPs with non-competitive planks like "give food to all cats" -- fairness should frame how this process of finding good policies operates 

### AT: Most Real World/Topic Education 

#### We do defend every word -- we don't think all PICs are bad, but that entirely plan-inclusive counterplans wreck our unique offense 

#### Policymakers do not reject plans on face for lacking consultation, but just amend them -- likewise there's no case-specific disad/net benefit

#### We'll turn topic education because EPICs shift debate away from core affirmative controversies 

### AT: Should Means Immediate

#### Summers says "should" and "shall" are equivalent mandates in the context of specific jury decisions -- 

#### Prefer Raggi -- indicates that "should" otherwise shouldn't be conflated with imperatives, and is much more a preferential term in legal parlance 

#### Strong admonition \-\-- not mandatory

### AT: Key to Neg Ground

#### Neg offense can always be generated on case turns that involve the aff and their disads -- reciprocity demands that 1AC offense not be mooted 

### AT: Time Tradeoffs 

#### If this argument is true, the net benefit has been thumped repeatedly -- hold them to a high threshold for explaining when their impacts happen

#### Flows aff -- no literature on why the net benefit is germane to the aff
